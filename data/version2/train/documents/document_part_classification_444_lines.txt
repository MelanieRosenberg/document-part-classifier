the other two strengths.
This is highly likely a result of the biased training dataset, which contains a large number of
medium strength relationships as shown in Table 5.

Feature notations: 1--Penn Treebank based Unigram), 2- -unigrams with WordNet based POS correction,
3--Binary semantics-based features), 4--K-ary semantics-based features, 5--unary semantics based
features, and 6--bigrams.
A linear kernel is used to general all the results.
The standard error is that of the overall accuracy.

In this paper, we describe a novel feature space designed to effectively classify the polarity and
strength of relationships extracted from biomedical abstracts.
In addition to the conventional syntactic features such as unigrams and bigrams, we have also
explored and constructed semantics-based sequential features.
These features are constructed at three different levels: entity, phrase, and sentence.
A wrapper-based method is then used to select the optimal feature sets for both polarity and
strength prediction.
Specifically, a multi-stage SVM classifier and an SVR predictor are built for polarity and strength
prediction, respectively.
Two different schemas, namely, (1 vs.  all) and (2 vs.
2), are employed to build the multi-stage SVM.
Finally, three different kernel functions are considered at different stage of this SVM classifier.
Our intensive evaluations have shown that for polarity prediction, the (2 vs.
2) schema in general works better than the (1 vs.  all).
It produces the highest polarity accuracy of 0.91 when both unigrams and semantics-based sequential
structures (KSS) are used, with a standard error ranging between 0.01~0.02.
On the other hand, we find that for strength prediction, unigrams solely can produce satisfying
results.
We obtain a high accuracy of 0.96, with the standard error ranging between 0.61%~0.63% for the
strength analysis.
We are currently expanding our annotated corpus to facilitate further validation of the findings
reported in this work.
We are also integrating this module with other modules as shown in Figure 1 towards building a
quantitative food-disease-gene network.
Finally, we are creating an interactive user interface to visually present this network.

helping annotate the corpus and providing constructive suggestions and comments during this study.
