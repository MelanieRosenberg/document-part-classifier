Copper  : Superoxide     Erythrocy    Yes     Among   four men  fed a copper deficient diet for
dismutase                te                   4 months, erythrocyte S.O.D  declined for all 4.
Copper  repletion restored S.O.D levels
Copper                   Plasma/se    No      No  (p 211): large number of lifestyle
rum                  factors/pathologic conditions probably alter
blood copper  concentrations (smoking,
infections)
Copper                   Hair         No      No  evidence (212) and data suggests influenced    No. Copper-dependent   enzyme  superoxide
by external contamination                          dismutase in erythrocytes and copper-protein
complex  caeroplasmin  in serum have been
shown  to be associated with copper intake, but
these markers may  be influenced by nondietary
factors (p 193)
Selenium                 Blood        Yes     Yes. Erythrocyte is probably superior to serum     Yes (p 193). Relationship between  selenium

nts                  measure  of long-term intake (p 206). Lower        Urine: reasonable marker, plasma  reflects intake
Toenails             influence of environment  in countries where       provided that the range of variation is large. Red
wearing  shoes is norm (toenails). Selenium        cell and glutathione perioxidase are
status is reduced by smoking, also in older        markers of longer-term intakes. Hair and
persons (p 207); Relationship of selenium with     toenails are alternative possibilities, although
disease may  be modified by other antioxidants     contamination  of hair samples with shampoo
(vit E and C)                                      must be controlled for
Glutathione              Plasma       No      Is poor measure of selenium  intake among
