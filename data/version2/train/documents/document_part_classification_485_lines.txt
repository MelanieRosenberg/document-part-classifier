One important note: as volatility rises and falls, the strike price range of options with non-zero
bids tends to expand and contract.
As a result, the number of options used in the VIX Index calculation may vary from month-to-month,
day-to-day and possibly, even minute-to-minute.
> Determine the forward SPX level, F, by identifying the strike price at which the absolute
difference between the call and put prices is smallest.
The call and put prices in the following table reflect the midpoint of each optionâ€™s bid / ask
quotation.
As shown below, the difference between the call and put prices is smallest at the 1965 strike for
the near- and the 1960 strike for the next-term options.

> Next, determine K 0 - the strike price equal to or otherwise immediately below the forward index
level, F - for the near- and next- term options.
In this example, K 0, 1 = 1960 and K 0, 2 = 1960.
> Select out-of-the-money put options with strike prices < K 0.
Start with the put strike immediately lower than K 0 and move to successively lower strike prices.
Exclude any put option that has a bid price equal to zero (i.e., no bid).
As shown below, once two puts with consecutive strike prices are found to have zero bid prices, no
puts with lower strikes are considered for inclusion.
(Note that the 1350 and 1355 put options are not included despite having non-zero bid prices.).
