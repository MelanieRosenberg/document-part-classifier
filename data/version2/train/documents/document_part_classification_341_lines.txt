But results of this test has shown that the students of different strands (mathematics, experimental
science and humanities) could not understand the relation between mathematics and real-life for many
items of first part of questionnaire (first, second and third items for mathematical, experimental
science and humanities strands respectively) (P>0.05).

In Table 5 for first open-ended question, the findings indicated that students of mathematical
strand have more frequency percent (64% for "yes answer") than other strands in first category
(Quality of examples).
In second category (subject variety of examples), students of mathematical strand have the highest
frequency percent in particular the numbers part; 23%.
In addition students of humanities strand has not any response in majority of items.
Also students of experimental strand have the highest frequency percent; 50.8% for third category
(context of examples).
