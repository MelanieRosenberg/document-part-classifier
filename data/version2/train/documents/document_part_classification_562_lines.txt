The FDA recently recommended that a warning be issued regarding adverse effects associated with BzRA
hypnotics.
These medications have been associated with reports of disruptive sleep related behaviors including
sleepwalking, eating, driving, and sexual behavior.
Patients should be cautioned about the potential for these adverse effects, and about the importance
of allowing appropriate sleep time, using only prescribed doses and avoiding the combination of BzRA
hypnotics with alcohol, other sedatives, and sleep restriction.
General comments about sedatives/hypnotics:.
dos- ages for the treatment of insomnia.
These medications are not FDA approved for insomnia and their efficacy for this indication is not
well estab- lished.
OTC sleep medications contain antihistamines as the primary agent; efficacy for treatment of
insomnia is not well established, especially its long-term use.
