Information Management Systems, Inc. Oncology Analyzer database, survival data, expert opinion, data from the literature, and unit costs from various published offi cial sources. Costs were infl ated to 2006 rates using consumer price indexes (France, Germany, Italy and Spain) or a health infl ation index (UK). The initial treatment costs per patient, which included the cost of biopsy and subsequent surgical or non- surgical treatment, were € 3171 in the UK, € 4057 in Germany, € 5851 in France, € 5226 in Italy and € 3256 in Spain ( Fig. 1 ). Surgery accounted for the largest proportion of initial treatment costs in most countries, with the exception of the UK, where radiotherapy accounted for a greater percentage ( Fig. 1 ). Costs of treatment over 1 year were calculated for all patients, regardless of whether they were treated, and included the unit costs of treatment, relapse costs and average monthly follow-up costs. The total costs for all diagnosed patients in the fi rst year after diagnosis were € 116.7 million (UK), € 179 million (Germany), € 167.5 million (France), € 106.7 million (Italy) and € 114.6 million (Spain). In comparison, a recent study in Italy by Lazzaro et al . [ 13 ] also looked at the fi rst-year costs of prostate cancer in 2000. The estimated cost per patient in Italy was € 6600, which is higher than the value estimated in the Fourcade publication [ 14 ] . The difference in values is probably attributable to lower rates of radiation treatment and a higher use of hormonal treatment in the Lazzaro study, in which
Total 5-year costs, including costs of both diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer, is reported in a second study by Fourcade et al . (Benedict A, Fourcade RO, Black LK, Stokes ME, Alcaraz A, Castro RS. Long term costs of prostate cancer: estimates for France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK. In preparation. 2011 ). These values were € 269 million (UK), € 618 million (France), € 486 million (Germany), € 364 million (Italy) and € 198 million (Spain). A UK study estimated that total costs for men diagnosed with prostate cancer in the 2001 – 2002 BAUS data with 5-year follow-up, were £ 92.74 million, with an average cost per patient of £ 7294 over 5 years [ 16 ] , higher than Fourcade ’ s UK estimates, which ranged between € 7040 and € 8580 ( £ 5547 – £ 6761) depending on cancer stage. Discrepancies between the two studies may arise through differences in the estimations of individual treatment costs, the proportions of patients receiving each type of therapy, or a combination of both.
Results from three sources presenting cost data for prostate cancer in the USA are shown in Table 1 [ 12,15,17 ] . The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has published annual cost data for prostate cancer using the most recent cancer incidence, survival and cost
of care data [ 12 ] . The NCI estimate for expenditure on prostate cancer treatment in 2006 was $9.862 billion, and average Medicare payments per patient in the fi rst year after diagnosis were $11 000. It should be noted when interpreting this data that use of PSA testing for prostate cancer is more widespread in the USA than in many other countries, thus increasing the number of cases identifi ed. In addition, Medicare did not cover certain cancer care expenses such as oral medicines, commonly used to treat prostate cancer until January 2006. These out-of-pocket costs may comprise 10% of the $11 000 estimate. Direct medical expenditures are only one part of the total economic burden of cancer, as cancer- related illnesses and death lead to losses in economic productivity.
Recent analyses of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)- Medicare database tracked healthcare use and costs (projected to 2004 levels) from diagnosis and initial treatment [ 15 ] , in addition to a 4-year follow-up [ 17 ] , for a cohort of 81 659 elderly patients with prostate cancer who had Medicare claims from 1991 to 2003 [ 15 ] , and 1991 to 2004 [ 17 ] , respectively. Treatment in the fi rst year after diagnosis was calculated to incur costs of $21 040 per patient; $13 091 for prostate cancer-related costs and $7949 for medical costs unrelated to prostate cancer [ 15 ] . In terms of cost at each stage, as expected, there was an increase in costs from stage I to IV [ 15,17 ] . Prostate cancer-related costs over 4 years from diagnosis averaged $18 168 per patient [ 17 ] . The annual healthcare cost burden estimated in 2009 is > $2.5 billion annually for initial care alone [ 17 ] .
A recent analysis of US managed care data revealed similar costs for initial therapy in men with prostate cancer [ 18 ] . During the fi rst 2 years after diagnosis, the average total cost across all patients was $48 808, with $29 417 representing prostate cancer-related costs. Those patients receiving treatment incurred costs fi ve times higher than those undergoing watchful waiting ($38 945 vs $7595). The highest costs were incurred within the fi rst 3 months after diagnosis and decreased substantially over time. Among patients receiving initial treatment, surgery incurred costs of $31 666 with the majority attributable to inpatient costs ($26 539).
