*MCP (cid:2) metacarpophalangeal; RF (cid:2) rheumatoid factor; ACPA (cid:2) anti(cid:3)citrullinated protein antibody. †Derived from odds ratios from the multivariate regression model, and interpreted as the increase in the odds of having rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with as opposed to without the respective feature (e.g., weight of 1.5 for swelling of proximal interphalangeal [PIP] joints means that the odds of having RA is 1.5-fold in patients with as opposed to patients without swelling of a PIP joint).
Phase 1. The aim of Phase 1 was to identify the contributions of clinical and laboratory variables that in practice were the most predictive of the decision to initiate DMARD therapy in a population of patients with early undifferentiated synovitis. Initiation of DMARD therapy was used as an indicator of the physician’s opinion that the patient was at risk of developing persistent and/or erosive arthritis that we would currently consider to be RA. Data on 3,115 patients from 9 early arthritis cohorts who were consid- ered not to have evidence of another possible diagnosis explaining their presentation were obtained. Between July 2007 and November 2008 an expert working group developed an analysis strategy that related an agreed- upon list of standardized clinical and laboratory vari- ables collected at baseline to the initiation of DMARD treatment within the next 12 months. MTX initiation was used as the gold standard for this purpose. The analytical process aimed to identify the independent contribution of each variable on this list and included univariate regression modeling, a subsequent principal components analysis, and a multivariate regression model that included all identified components (25). The resulting list of informative variables identified during that process and the weights based on the odds ratios are shown in Table 1. Phase 2. Phase 2 consisted of a consensus-based, decision science–informed approach, which took place between November 2008 and June 2009. The purpose of this phase was to derive a clinician-based judgment on
the relative contribution of clinical and laboratory fac- tors deemed to be important in influencing the proba- bility of developing “persistent inflammatory and/or erosive arthritis that is currently considered to be RA” (hereinafter referred to as “developing RA”). An expert panel was assembled, comprising 12 rheumatologists from Europe and 12 from North Amer- ica with extensive experience in the diagnosis and man- agement of RA. They provided real-life case scenarios of patients with early undifferentiated inflammatory arthri- tis representing low to high probability of developing RA. A 2-day workshop was held in May 2009 in which domains (factors) and categories within those domains that were important in determining the probability of developing RA were identified. When appropriate, these judgments were informed by the results of Phase 1 and other available literature. The relative importance or weights of these domains and their categories were determined by means of decision science theory and conjoint adaptive technology, using the computerized 1000Minds program (www.1000minds.com) in an inter- active and iterative process (26). This analysis permitted the calculation of an individual’s score of the likelihood of developing RA from 0 to 100, where a higher score indicated greater likelihood of RA development. The domains, categories, and weights derived during that initial process are shown in Table 2.
Objectives of Phase 3. In Phase 3 the working group integrated the findings of the first 2 phases, refined the scoring system, and determined the optimal cut point to define “definite RA.” The goal of this final phase was to utilize the results of Phases 1 and 2 to develop a scoring system that would be applicable to newly presenting patients with undifferentiated inflam- matory arthritis to permit identification of those with a high probability of developing persistent and/or erosive RA. Being intended for use with newly presenting patients, the scoring system should be robust enough that it could be applied repeatedly during the early course of disease, such that a patient identified as not classifiable as having definite RA at initial presentation might be classified as having definite RA at a subsequent time point. The work was not aimed at classifying subjects with established disease, either active or inac- tive. However, the working group recognized that pa- tients may present for the first time with disease that is at a later stage and being treated. Thus, although it was not the explicit charge of the working group to provide
