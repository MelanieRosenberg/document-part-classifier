samples)) / (geometric mean cpm of no drug samples). Percentage reductions are used to plot percentage inhibition of growth as a function of drug concentrations. IC 50 values are determined by linear regression analyses on the linear segments of the curves (IC 90 values can also be determined by curve-fitting and can provide an useful measure of variation between experiments). Assays are typically repeated on two or three separate occasions. Within each experiment, standard deviations are typically less than 10% of the mean. Differences in parasite stages of development can lead to up to two-fold shifts in the IC 50 values between experiments; however, these differences rarely affect the overall relationships between the parasite lines in terms of their differences in drug response 4-11 .

Multiplication rate refers to increase in total numbers of viable parasites per 48-hr generation. These rates and the drug pheno- types refer to data from the Fidock laboratory (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, NY) and may not be the same elsewhere. See www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/Malaria/epid.html for additional information on these and other P. falciparum strains.
