To put these figures in perspective, the average monthly healthcare spending for people in our data diagnosed with type 2 diabetes was about $1,600 in 2014.19 Pre-diagnosis, cancer patients spent, on average, less than diabetes patients. The post-diagnosis monthly healthcare spending for the three cancers studied stabilized near or above the diabetes patient level after several months. This finding suggests that, for survivors, a diagnosis of cancer, like the diagnosis of a chronic condition, results in persistent healthcare spending.
With some variation over time and across cancer types, care for the cancer population involves the six categories of services analyzed. The bars in Figures 2a-2c indicate that some patients had significant use of facility services in the year preceding the cancer diagnosis. For both colorectal and lung cancers, total spending on hospital inpatient increased as a percentage of total immediately following diagnosis. In all three cancers, the chemotherapy share of total spending increased rapidly in the first few months after diagnosis and, with the exception of breast cancer, continued at a fairly consistent level of around 20% of spending in subsequent years. Radiation therapy represented a small share of total spending except for breast cancer patients in the year following diagnosis.
