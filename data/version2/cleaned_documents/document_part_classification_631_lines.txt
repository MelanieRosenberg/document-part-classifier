I hereby authorize  the Health  Care Authority  (HCA)  to start electronic funds transfers from  the financial institution named  above.  I
understand   my  authorization  remains  in effect until I give written notice to HCA, which I must do at least 15 business  days before  my
next monthly   withdrawal.  If I want to change the  checking  or savings account  that HCA  transfers funds, I will submit a new  2020  PEBB
Electronic Debit Service Agreement    form  at least 15 business days before  the next  withdrawal.  Withdrawals   will occur on the 15th
day of each  month   that I have PEBB  insurance  coverage, and  will be for the total amount  of my  monthly  premium    and applicable
premium   surcharges.  If the 15th falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the withdrawal   will occur on the next business  day. HCA  will
provide  payment   instructions and  notify me of payments   returned  for insufficient funds or closed accounts.  HCA  reserves  the right
to change  or terminate  this agreement   as an account  payment   method   for any reason  and  at any time. If HCA does  so, we will give
notice of at least 15 business days.
You must continue to pay your premiums and applicable premium surcharges until you receive a letter from HCA with your EDS start date. EDS approval takes six to eight weeks. You must submit a new 2020 PEBB Electronic Debit Service Agreement to HCA when your bank account information changes.
