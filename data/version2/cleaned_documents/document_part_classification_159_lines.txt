Our office has implemented a policy which will help to reduce the cost of healthcare for both you and the practice. As a benefit to you, we will ask for a credit card number to be held securely until your charges have been processed. Once we have confirmed with your insurance company the amount owed by you, the credit card on file will be charged. A copy of the receipt will be mailed to you for your records.
