istic option. Clinical diagnosis offers the advantages of ease, speed, and low cost. In areas where malaria is prevalent, clinical diagnosis usually results in all patients with fever and no apparent other cause being treated for malaria. This approach can iden- tify most patients who truly need antimalarial treat- ment, but it is also likely to misclassify many who do not (15). Over-diagnosis can be considerable and contributes to misuse of antimalarial drugs. Considerable overlap exists between the signs and
symptoms of malaria and other frequent diseases, especially acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI), and can greatly increase the frequency of misdiagnosis and mistreatment (16). Attempts to improve the specificity of clinical diagnosis for malaria by including signs and symp- toms other than fever or history of fever have met with only minimal success (17).
