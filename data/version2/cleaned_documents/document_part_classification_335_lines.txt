Approximately 1 in 5 articles received the open access treatment, with some journals receiving a higher allocation based on their size and frequency of publication (Table 1). The proportion of treatment articles was determined in consultation with the publisher in advance of the study and was set to avoid radical alteration of the appearance and performance of the journal. Based on prestudy analysis of citationvariation,oursamplesizeprovidesuswitha0.8power to detect a 25% difference in citations between treatment and control articles for all journals (P(cid:1)0.05, 2-sided).
The randomization, selection, and manipulation of access status for treatment articles were controlled entirely by the researcher, who was provided with direct access to the admin- istration of the journal websites. Authors and editors were not alerted as to which articles received the open access treat- ment. For some journals, treatment articles were indicated on the journal websites by an open lock icon.
