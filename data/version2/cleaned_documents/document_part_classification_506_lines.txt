The   Philosophy        and   History
of  Osteopathic        Medicine
The DO Difference:
Not Just Manipulative Medicine
T here are two main distinctions between osteopathic and allopathic physicians. The first, more obvious difference lies in the osteopathic physicians’ use of osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM). While OMM is most commonly known by the general public to treat neuromusculoskeletal injury, DOs may utilize it in their diagnosis and treatment of disease involving internal organs and all other parts of the body as well. The other, more subtle – and arguably more important – distinction between the two professions is that osteopathic medicine offers a concise philosophy on which all clinical practice is based. Central to this philosophy is the belief that the body has an inherent healing mechanism that allows it to maintain health, resist illness, and recover from disease processes. The goal of osteopathic medical treatment is
1. The body is completely united; the person is a fully inte- grated being of body, mind and spirit. No single part of the body functions independently. Each separate part is interconnected with all others and serves to benefit the collective whole of the person. Alterations in any part of the system, including an individual’s mental and spiritual health, affect the function of the body as a whole and all other parts therein.
and health-maintenance. Health is the natural state of the body, and the body possesses complex, homeo- static, self-regulatory mechanisms that it uses to heal itself from injury. In times of disease, when a part of the body is functioning sub-optimally, other parts of the body come out of their natural state of health in order to compensate for the dysfunction. During this compensatory process, however, new dysfunctions may arise. Osteopathic physicians must work to adjust the body so as to realign its parts back to normal. Osteopathic manipulative medicine aims to restore the body’s self-healing capacity by decreasing allo- static load, or the physiologic effects of chronic bodily stresses,1 and enhancing the immune system.
3. Structure and function are reciprocally interrelated. The structure of a body part governs its function, and thus abnormal structure manifests as dysfunction. Func- tion also governs structure. In addition, if the body’s overall structure is suboptimal, its functioning and capacity for self-healing will be inhibited as well.
