Abstract              - reflects the main 'story' of the   - past (perfect) tense and         - avoid introducing   the topic;

Introduction          - introduces the topic and           - simple  tense for reffering      - use the state-of-the-art references;
defines the terminology;             to established  knowledge    or    - follow the logical moves;
- relates to the existing            past tense  for literature         - define your  terminology   to avoid

Methodology           - provides enough   detail for       - past tense but  active           - mention  everything   you  did that

Results               - gives summary    results in        - past tense;                      - present summary    data related to

Conclusions           - answers  research                  - simple  or present  tense        - do not recapitulate  results but

Discussion            - explains discrepancies  and        results);                          - make  strong  statements  (avoid  "It

title must be  included;           - cite primary  source rather than
review  papers;
Participants also discovered that all RAS's can be separated in subsections or signposts, which can be arbitrary, but improve the structure of a RA. The recognized subsections were: research topic and definitions, research objectives (questions), methodological techniques, experimental set-up, object of the study (e.g. study area), main discoveries (analysed data), answers on research questions, explanation of the conclusions and further research and implications. The main RAS's are listed in a flow chart, showing main relations between different sections (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 shows the substructure of Introduction and Discussion RAS as the most important RAS's.
