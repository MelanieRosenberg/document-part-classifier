With the exception of metals, many building materials tend to expand with an increase in moisture content and contract with a loss of moisture. For some building materials these movements are reversible; while for others they are irreversible or only partially reversible. Brick. Brick expand slowly over time upon exposure to water or humid air. This expansion is not reversible by drying at normal temperatures. A brick is smallest in size when it cools after exiting the kiln. The brick will draw
Unrestrained thermal movement is the product of temperature change multiplied by the coefficient of thermal expansion and the length of the element. The stresses developed by restrained thermal move- ments are equal to the change in temperature multi- plied by the coefficient of thermal expansion and by the modulus of elasticity of the material.
The temperature change used for estimating thermal movements should be based on mean temperatures in the component. For solid masonry walls, tempera- tures at the center of the wall should be used. In cav- ity walls and veneers, the temperature at the center of each wythe or component should be used. In dis- continuous construction, the wythes will have different temperatures due to the separation of the wythes by an air space and perhaps insulation.
Surface temperatures of brick walls may be much higher than the ambient air temperature. Wall orienta- tion, color, brick wall type and presence and location of insulation are governing factors. It is possible for a dark, south facing wall to reach surface tempera- tures as high as 140 ºF (60 ºC), while the ambient air temperature is well below 100 ºF (38 ºC). The mean temperature of a 4 in. (102 mm) thick insulated brick veneer is very close to the surface temperature of the brick. A thicker or uninsulated wall may have a lower mean temperature than the outside surface. The tem- perature range experienced by brickwork is the differ- ence of the high and low mean temperatures of the brickwork. In practice, this range is usually taken as 100 ºF (38 ºC) and is based on the annual high and low temperature of the exterior ambient air.
Other building materials expand and contract at rates different from that of brick masonry. These differences are important when elements such as window frames, railings, or copings are attached to brick masonry. Distress may occur in either material. Bowing may occur in composite walls that have con- crete masonry interior wythes.
