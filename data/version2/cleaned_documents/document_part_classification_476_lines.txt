Masonry Units. Information on classification and selection of brick can be found in Technical Notes 9A and 9B, respectively. Further information on brick masonry material selection for adequate strength and compliance with the Masonry Standards Joint Committee (MSJC) Code and Specification can be found in Technical Notes 3 Series.
Concrete masonry units are usually used for the interior wythe of a cavity wall in combination with a brick masonry exterior. They may also be used as accent bands in the exterior brick wythe. Hollow or solid concrete masonry units should conform to ASTM C 55 Specification for Concrete Building Brick, ASTM C 90 Specification for Loadbearing Concrete Masonry Units or ASTM C 129 Specification for Non-Loadbearing Concrete Masonry Units. Non load- bearing concrete masonry units are usually specified for the interior wythe when the brick and block cavity wall is used as infill walls for concrete or steel frame structural systems if shear loads are not transmitted to that wythe.
Structural clay tile has been used as a backing material for cavity wall construction. Structural clay tile for this purpose should conform to ASTM C 126, ASTM C 34 Specification for Structural Clay Load-Bearing Wall Tile or ASTM C 212 for Structural Clay Facing Tile. Clay tile units under ASTM C 126 and ASTM C 212 are commonly used for the interior wythe of a cavity wall when left exposed for architectural appearance reasons.
The strength and moisture penetration resistance of a brick masonry cavity wall are affected by the mortar selection and compatibility with the brick units. Portland cement-lime, mortar cement, or masonry cement mortars can be used. However, mortars with an air content less than 12 percent are recommended for their superior bond strength and resistance to moisture penetration. The MSJC Code requires that the allowable flexural tensile stresses be reduced by approximately 50 percent for assemblies constructed with masonry cement mortars or portland cement-lime mortars that have air entrainment. In addition, some building codes prohibit the use of masonry cement mortars and all Type N mortars in Seismic Performance Categories D and E (formerly Seismic Zones 3 and 4). Mortar should meet the proportion requirements of ASTM C 270 Specification for Mortar for Unit Masonry as shown in Table 1. Mortar type selection should be based on project requirements, such as strength and compatibility with a particular brick unit. Types N or S mortars are typically used in brick masonry cavity walls. See Technical Notes 8 Series for more detailed information on mortar types and selection.
