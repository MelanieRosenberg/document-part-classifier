Journalists act as gatekeepers to the scientific world, control- ling what information reaches the public eye and how it is presented. Analyzing the kinds of research that typically re- ceive more media attention is vital to understanding issues such as the “science of science communication” (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2017), patterns of misinformation, and the “cycle of hype.” We track the coverage of 91,997 scientific articles published in 2016 across various disciplines, publishers, and news outlets us- ing metadata and text data from a leading tracker of sci- entific coverage in social and traditional media, Altmetric. We approach the problem as one of ranking each day’s, or week’s, papers by their likely level of media attention, us- ing the learning-to-rank model lambdaMART (Burges 2010). We find that ngram features from the title, abstract and press release significantly improve performance over the metadata features journal, publisher, and subjects.
News media are an important source of scientific informa- tion for the public in domains such as health, medicine, and climate change research, making the accurate communica- tion of findings – and patterns of misinformation – a vi- tal issue for society and public policy (Geller, Bernhardt, and Holtzman 2002; Boykoff and Boykoff 2004; Brechman, Lee, and Cappella 2009). A substantial amount of scholarly attention has been devoted to studying the mechanisms by which academic research findings move along and through a chain of translation-oriented intermediaries, from journals anduniversitycommunicationsofficestoreportersandblog- gers and finally to citizen groups and individual members of the public. Journalists’ internal processes of selection and framing news are very significant, as they are an antecedent and structural factor that affects all subsequent issues of public attention. Because parsing and interpreting the methods and results of highly technical scientific papers is a difficult task, journalists may use simple heuristics to determine whether research is novel and of high quality and impact, such as inspecting the name of the journal and the article subjects. An even simpler explanation is that journalists may publish Copyright c (cid:13) 2018, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.
on a subset of the press releases they read each day, either found on a press release aggregation website such as Eu- rekAlert! or Science Daily or sent to them by media offices. Discovering what sort of content journalists believe is sig- nificant and likely to be popular provides insight into how journalists judge the newsworthiness of different content, uncovering their biases and preferences, and helps shed light on high-profile issues being actively debated relating to the “science of science communication” (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2017). Scholars who have studied the decision-making of jour- nalists in terms of story selection and framing have exam- ined various factors, from institutional and economic incen- tives to a need for social validation (Donsbach 2004). In the realm of science, practices such as embargoing of scholarly findings and the attendant effects on communication have been examined, suggesting that certain science communica- tions and public relations strategies can influence news cov- erage (Kiernan 2003b). Research has suggested that jour- nalists seldom choose to report on scientific studies outside of the domains of health and medicine (Suleski and Ibaraki 2009). Issues of hype and errors of framing and omission have long plagued various forms of news media and science communication, with the cycle of hype sometimes begin- ning with researchers themselves using exaggerated terms such as “breakthrough” in press materials and public an- nouncements (Bubela et al. 2009). News reporting may then replicate the exaggerations found in such communi- cations materials (Sumner et al. 2014). Further, news sto- ries, particularly those produced by elite outlets, may influ- ence the prestige of, and citations to, scientific research, fu- eling a hype cycle that is increasingly coming under scrutiny in the research and media communities (Kiernan 2003a; Caulfield et al. 2016).
Using the metadata supplied by Altmetric,1 we are able to find and crawl thousands of scientific article abstracts, press releases, and related news stories.
