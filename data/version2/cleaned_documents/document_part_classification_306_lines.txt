Second, deepening of institutional structure should be an ongoing project, particularly as it relates to bioethical codes (Baker, 2015; Tartzian et al., 2015), as well as proactive institutional engage- ment to improve responsiveness (Fenton et al., 2015). Institutional engagement with the future of the bioethics field is required to steward professionalism (White et al., 2014) and populate the health professions with those trained in bioethics, given radical changes in biomedical research and practice to come (Grady, 2013). This is particularly important given the rise of Big Data, as well as new biomedical methodologies such as crowdsourcing applied to biomedical research (Callaghan, 2014a; 2014b). Third, explicit engagement with issues relating to channels of communication around biotech de- velopments is needed, in order to ensure narratives are not ‘captured’ by those with agendas (O’Keefe et al., 2015) and validity of public knowledge is ensured through development of ap- propriate biomedicine vocabularies. These practical initiatives capture the spirit of citizen science theory (Bonney et al., 2009) in terms of increasing responsiveness of populations to issues which affect them, or democratisation of both scientific discovery and its scrutiny. Theory related to wicked problems, or problems at the nexus of human values and uncertainty (Rittel & Webber, 1973), together with citizen science theory may help bioethicists negotiate changes to come in the biomedical research landscape.
Fourth, theory building requires synthesis of different literatures which advance the same goal, namely, to empower the crowd to engage with important scientific issues such as genetic engi- neering, human tissue market development, and other important biomedical research outcomes. This entails a need to build synergies between citizen science theory and other bodies of theory such as informing science, which offer an emergent body of research specifically focused on in- forming stakeholders.
