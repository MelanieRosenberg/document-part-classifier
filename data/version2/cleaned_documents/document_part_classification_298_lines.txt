Stabilization of temperature T in the friction zone for all sam- ples comes in the range of 8 minutes. (for Kocetal GF705) up to 40 minutes (Nylon 66) (Fig. 8). The general view of the ex- perimental parts made of poly- meric-composite material CCPA- 6-30 is shown in Fig. 9 We have developed meth- ods for heat treatment in oils, which make it impossible to hy- groscopic PKM based on aliphatic polyamides in volumes that led to a change in geometric dimensions or changes in properties. The results of the research have shown that the Ny- lon 66 PCM, which provides rela- tive abrasive stability, is 39 % higher
