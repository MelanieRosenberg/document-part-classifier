In addition to providing direct contribution towards the discovery of medical research, governments in many countries have also implemented a range of indirect measures to incentivize R&D. These include allowing private companies to claim high-level tax credits or deductions for activities related to R&D (Table 4.5).

In summary, public and non-profit-making sectors, and by extension tax-payers and philanthropists, have provided considerable financial and non-financial contributions towards the R&D of cancer medicines. This means that in many cases, pharmaceutical companies have not incurred the full costs of R&D. The pharmaceutical industry has also benefited greatly from the knowledge generated by public-sector investments in R&D, and by having access to research supported by public funding at costs, if any, lower than the market value.
Considering these facts, some stakeholders have questioned whether pharmaceutical companies could claim to recover the full costs of R&D through setting high prices for medicines (340,341). More directly, these stakeholders are seeking clarity as to whether the public has been “paying twice”, or should be paying
twice, for the hundreds of medicines developed at least with partial support from public resources (340). This raises an important question: does the public have the right to expect governments to play a greater role in exercising more stringent pricing regulations, or simply, by imposing lower prices for cancer medicines in order to realize a more direct financial return for public investment on behalf of the tax-payers? Another pertinent question is whether the ongoing push by research outputs from publicly-funded universities have tilted the pharmaceutical industry at the expense of the tax-payers (342). relationship between the government, industry and university (343).
