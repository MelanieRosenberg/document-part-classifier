The use of two antimalarials simultaneously, especially when the antimalarials have different mechanisms of action, has the potential for inhib- iting the development of resistance to either of the components. The efficacy of a combination of a 4-aminoquinoline drug (either chloroquine or amo- diaquine) with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine has been reviewed (43). The results of this review sug- gested that the addition of either chloroquine or amodiaquine to SP marginally improved parasitological clearance (compared with SP alone). The studies reviewed were mostly done in areas and at times when both SP and chloroquine/amodi- aquine retained a fair amount of efficacy, and it is not clear from these studies how well such a combination would act in areas where one of the components was significantly compromised. Additionally, to date, there are no data to suggest whether this slightly improved clearance would
Resistance to antimalarial drugs has been described for two of the four species of malaria parasite that naturally infect humans, P. falciparum and P. vivax. P. falciparum has developed resistance to nearly all antimalarials in current use, although the geo- graphical distribution of resistance to any single antimalarial drug varies greatly (Table 3). P. vivax infection acquired in some areas has been shown to be resistant to chloroquine and/or primaquine (44, 45). Chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum malaria has

1 Reports of resistance to a given agent occurring in an area does not necessarily mean that occurrence is frequent enough to pose a significant public health risk. Bold “Y” indicates agents to which significant resistance occurs in a given area (although actual risk may be highly focal, e.g. South-East Asia, where MQ resistance, while very frequent in some limited areas, is infrequent or absent in most others). Regular “Y” indicates that, while resistance to agent has been reported, it is not believed to occur frequently enough to pose a significant public health risk.
