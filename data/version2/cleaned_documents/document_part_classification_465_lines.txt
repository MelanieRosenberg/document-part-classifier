General recommendations are: the steel angles should be at least 1/4 in. (6A mm) thick; the horizontal leg should be at least 3-1/2 in. (89 mm) for use with nominal 4 in. (100 mm) thick brick and 3 in. (75 mm) for use with nominal 3 in. (75 mm) thick brick. The minimum required bearing length on each end of the fireplace opening is 4 in. (100 mm). Steel angle lintels should have a space at their ends to permit thermal expansion.
Combustion Chamber. The shape and depth of the combustion chamber will greatly influence draft, combustion air requirements and the amount of heat reflected and radiated into the room. Figure 1 illustrates the shape and Table 1 provides recommended dimensions for the combustion chamber. These dimensions may be varied slightly, but the information given is based on successful designs. Significant changes should not be made without consulting a fireplace design consultant.
The sides and lower portion of the back of the combustion chamber should be vertical. Above the vertical portion of the back, the brick should be sloped forward towards the fireplace opening to support the metal damper and the clay flue lining. For the maximum amount of reflected heat into the room, the sloped portion of the back should be plane rather than concave. If it is concave, more heat will be reflected back into the fire rather than into the room. Greater splay of the sides also increases the amount of heat reflected into the room.
The combustion chamber should be constructed of nominal 4 in. (100 mm) thick brick. When refractory brick or firebrick are used, model building codes permit the total wall thickness to be reduced. Thin mortar joints, not more than 1/4 in.(6.4 mm), should be specified. A 1 in. (25 mm) air space should be provided between the combustion chamber wall and the backup wall, although not required by building codes. This air space provides for thermal expansion of the combustion chamber. A noncombustible, compressible, fibrous insulation or similar material should be wrapped around the combustion chamber to ensure that this air space is maintained. The backup wall should be no less than 4 in. (100 mm) in thickness around the back of the combustion chamber to support the loads from the smoke chamber and chimney above.
Throat. The throat is a slot-like opening directly above the top of the firebox through which flames, smoke and combustion gases pass into the smoke chamber and upward through the chimney. Because of its effect on draft, the throat of the fireplace should be carefully designed. It should be a minimum of 8 in. (200 mm) above the highest point of the fireplace opening. The throat is illustrated in Fig. 1a and appropriate dimensions are found in Table 1.
Cast refractory and formed clay throats are available, built to certain angles and dimensions to fit most conventional fireplace dimensions. These elements are positioned on top of the firebox walls and eliminate the need of constructing brick courses to form the throat. Once in place, brick masonry can be built around the throat to give the appearance of conventionally built throats in the breastwork of the fireplace.
Damper-The damper closes the fireplace opening to exterior air infiltration and can be used to control the burning rate of the fireplace. A metal damper may be placed in the throat, extending the full width of the throat opening, or at the top of the chimney.
