a) The regulation gives data subjects the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, where there is a legal or similarly significant effect on the person (the regulation prohibits automated processing where there is no meaningful human involvement in the decision and where the decision either impacts one’s legal rights, or the decision has the potential to significantly influence the circumstances, behavior, or choices of the individuals concerned). b) Other considerations: i) Research affecting the healthcare a person receives, where there is no human involvement in the decision, would be considered covered under the regulation (i.e., assigning trial subjects to receive an intervention or placebo, based solely on the individual’s personal data, i.e., test results)
Controllers who do not need to know identity of data subject are not required to learn identity to comply with exercise of rights of access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, or portability (often the case for research entities that hold only pseudonymised data).
BREACH     OF                       Both controllers and processors  have  obligations to respond to a personal data breach.
PERSONAL     DATA
A personal data  breach is a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction,
loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored, or
otherwise processed,  in any form or medium   and is not limited to unauthorized access to
electronic data.
A controller must report a data breach to the data protection authority in the affected individual’s
country without  undue  delay,  and where   feasible within 72  hours  of becoming   aware  of the
breach,  unless  the breach  is unlikely to result in a risk to affected individuals.
In the event of a breach  causing   a high risk to affected individuals,  a controller must  notify
the affected individuals  without  undue   delay, unless  it qualifies for one of several
enumerated    exceptions.
