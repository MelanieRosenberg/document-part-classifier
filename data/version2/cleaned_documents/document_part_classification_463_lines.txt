Method  is generally     Many   manufacturers  of colored mortars do not recommend    chemical  cleaning
Colored Mortars            controlled by         solutions. Unbuffered  acids and some  proprietary cleaners tend to bleach colored

1. Decide when to clean. Mortar must harden prior to cleaning. It is generally best to schedule cleaning at least seven days after brickwork is completed. In some cases it may be possible to clean earlier; how- ever, effects on the masonry and influencing factors such as weather conditions and the type of brick and mortar should be carefully considered. Prolonged time periods between the completion of the masonry and cleaning should be avoided. After one month, mortar smears and splatters left on brickwork become increasingly difficult to remove. 2. Remove larger clumps of mortar using wooden paddles or nonmetallic tools. Metal tools may damage the brickwork or leave behind fragments that oxidize and cause rust stains. 3. Select the proper cleaning solution. There are many types of proprietary cleaners available that are for- mulated to remove specific stains or for use with a particular type of brick. Be careful to select cleaning products suitable for the brick, mortar and adjacent materials and follow the cleaner manufacturerâ€™s rec- ommended instructions. Each product being considered should be evaluated as discussed previously in Trial Cleaning.
Do not use unbuffered muriatic acid. Use of unbuffered muriatic acid solutions tend to cause further stains and damage mortar joints. Many proprietary cleaners contain acids, however, their formulations include other chemicals that make them safer, easier to use properly and more environmentally responsible.
4. Protect adjacent materials and nearby plants. Mask or otherwise protect windows, doors, and materials such as sealants, metal, glass, wood, limestone, cast stone, concrete masonry and ornamental trim from cleaning solutions. Cleaning chemicals may also damage plants and grass. It may be necessary to pre- vent the cleaning solution and run-off from contacting plants or the surrounding soil. 5. Saturate the area to be cleaned. Flush with water from the top down. Saturated brick masonry will not absorb the cleaning solution or dissolved mortar particles. Areas below the area being cleaned should also be saturated and kept wet until after the final rinse to prevent streaking and absorption of the run-off from above.
