Producing competent primary care physicians, in par- ticular, is part of the mission statement of many, if not all, U.S. osteopathic medical schools. According to the 2014 U.S. News and World Report, a popular source of medical school rankings, osteopathic medical schools rank among the top producers of primary care doctors in the nation, with Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine (MSUCOM) being one of the ten top-ranked medical school in this category.13 Consequently, some cur- ricula may place a greater emphasis on such skills as bed- side manner, interviewing and building the physician- patient relationship. These schools do not in any way force students to go into primary care – many students simply choose to do so.14
Osteopathic medical schools also use differing cri- teria when selecting candidates to interview and/or extending offers of admission. For example, in the eval- uation of applicants, osteopathic medical schools place more emphasis on candidates’ interest in and knowledge of osteopathic philosophy. They also are more likely to seek out students who are interested in pursuing careers in primary care and in rural or underserved areas.3 Osteo- pathic admissions programs often view the candidate as a
whole, and are more forgiving in the sense that they accept grade replacement for repeated courses. They are less likely to place as much emphasis on Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) scores and/or GPAs as allopathic schools do.12 These differing criteria may explain some of the existing disparities in average admissions statis- tics between admitted students of osteopathic med- ical schools and those of allopathic medical schools. The 19,517 matriculating allopathic students in 2012 had an average combined MCAT score of 31.2 (Physical Science: 10.5, Verbal Reasoning: 9.8, Biological Science: 10.9) and average GPAs of 3.63, 3.75, and 3.68 for science, non- science, and total, respectively.15 In contrast, the same year, the 5,464 matriculating osteopathic medical students had an average MCAT score of 26.85 (PS: 8.74, VR: 8.63, BS: 9.48) with average science, non-science, and total GPAs of 3.37, 3.59, and 3.49, respectively.16 The other major factor contributing to this disparity is the difference in the actual applicant pools. Currently, the majority of medical school applicants do not apply to osteopathic medical programs, likely due to a general lack of accessible and reliable information concerning osteo- pathic medicine. Many applicants have not had any signif-
