The implications of the significant dispersion of prices are at least threefold.
Firstly, it indicates that existing procurement practices in some countries may not be the most
efficient, as lower prices could have been achieved.
Secondly, it may impair the countries’ coverage of essential cancer medicines when prices are higher
than their ability to fund and provide the medicines.
This would, in turn, have a negative impact on patients' timely access to medicines and their
ability to achieve the best possible health outcomes.
Thirdly, regional price differences within a country may cause inequitable access, with only some
patients having access to the medicines at lower prices.
