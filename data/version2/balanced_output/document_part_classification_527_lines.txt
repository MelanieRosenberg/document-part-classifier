A further example is the pricing of sofosbuvir (Sovaldi) – a medicine used for the treatment of
hepatitis C virus infection, potentially preventing future cases of liver cancer.
Fig.
3.3 (p.23) shows the timeline of price planning for Sovaldi based on information presented in the
report by the Committee on Finance of the United States Senate (100).
In this case, it shows the evolution of the expected price of Sovaldi from prior to its acquisition
(<US$ 50 000 per course) to the final launch price of US$ 84 000 per course.
The final price was decided based on an anticipated rise in revenue even though the manufacturer
expected the number of patients receiving the medicine would decline (p.43) (100), and various
stakeholders would react negatively to the firm’s final pricing of the product.
Furthermore, the manufacturer set a high price for Sovaldi with a view to consolidate the market’s
price expectation in preparation for setting an even higher price for a combination product that
contains sofosbuvir (Harvoni) that would be launched after Sovaldi.
It also included an arbitrary price increase from US$ 27 000 per bottle to US$ 28 000 per bottle
(i.e.
3.7% increase) because it would “be easy from the press release, from 28 days and $28,000” (p.57)
(100).
This example demonstrates that pricing solely according to commercial goals will impair a health
system’s ability to achieve public health goals because high prices limit patient access, thereby
limiting the full value potential of the innovation.
