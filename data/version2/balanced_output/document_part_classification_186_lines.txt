If you need to cancel an exam after you have registered, you must contact both the ACF office and
the test site administrator within two weeks of the test date.
The ACF registration fee may be transferred to a new test date within six months or will be
forfeited.
Host sites may charge an additional fee that is payable to the test site administrator hosting the
exam, if applicable.
Host site fees are separate from the amount due to the American Culinary Federation.
Contact the test administrator to confirm test time, host site fee and other specifics about the
facility and/or test.
