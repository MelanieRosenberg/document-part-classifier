Docosahexaenoic         Adipose        Validity          0.66      Correlation  with intake estimated from three 7-day weighted  food records
(n-3)                   Tissue                                     (Willett, p 223)
Reproducibility   0.93      Correlation  over 8 months  in 27 men and women   aged  20-29 (Willett, p 223).
Plasma         Validity          0.42      Correlation  of cholesterol ester fraction and intake in 3,570 adults (Willett, p
223)
Reproducibility   0.38      Correlation  of two measurements   taken 6 years apart in study of 759 Finnish
youths  (Willett, p 219)
Polyunsaturated         Adipose        Validity          0.80      Correlation  between  % of polyunsaturated  fatty acid relative to total fatty acid
fatty acids             tissue                                     intake and relative % of adipose tissue polyunsaturated fatty acid (Willett, p

Palmitic acid           Adipose        Validity          0.27      Correlation  adipose tissue measurement  with a FFQ  estimate among   118 men.
tissue                                     A  correlation of 0.14 was reported among  women.   Among   20 healthy subjects,
correlations between  normal  intake of total saturated fatty acids and fatty acid
composition  of triglycerides in adipose tissue was 0.57 (Willett, p 224)
Stearic acid            Adipose        Validity          0.56      Among    20 healthy subjects, correlations between normal intake of total
tissue                                     saturated fatty acids and fatty acid composition of triglycerides in adipose
tissue (Willett, p 224)
Trans fatty acids       Adipose        Validity          0.40      Correlation  between  adipose trans and intake estimated from the average of two
tissue                                     FFQ   among  140  Boston-area women.   Previous study: 115  Boston area women,
correlation of 0.51 between  trans intake estimated from a single FFQ and  a fatty
acid measurement.   Among   118 Boston-area  men:  correlation of 0.29 between
trans fatty acid measured in adipose and by  FFQ  (Willett, p 225)
Nitrogen                Urine          Validity          0.69      Correlation  between  nitrogen intakes estimated from weighted  food records of
16  days and the average of six 24-h urine nitrogen levels (160 women)  (Willett,
p 227)
Phyto Oestrogens        Plasma         Validity          0.97      Urinary  excretion (24 h) and plasma  concentrations of PO were  significantly
Genistein, daidzein     24 hr urine                      0.92      related to measured  dietary PO intake (r 0.97, P<0.001 and r 0.92,
P<0.001   respectively). These findings validate the PO database and indicate
that 24 h urinary excretion and timed plasma  concentrations can be used  as
biomarkers  of PO  intake. Br J Nutr. 2004 Mar;91(3):447-57
