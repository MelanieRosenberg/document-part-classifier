By participating in Northside’s Skip-A-Payment program, you request that Northside FCU defer your
loan payments as indicated.
You agree and understand that 1) Loans must have originated at least six months prior to the date
you choose to skip your payment; 2) Finance charges will continue to accrue at the rate provided in
your original loan agreement during and after this time; 3) Deferring your loan payment will result
in you having to pay higher total FINANCE CHARGES than if you made your payment s as originally
scheduled; 4) The payment deferral will extend the terms of your loan(s), and you will have to make
extra payments after your loan would otherwise be paid off; 5) You will be required to resume your
payments the following month; 6) If you elected GAP, War- ranty Coverage or Life/Disability
Insurance, the coverage will not be extended beyond the original maturity date; 7) All deferrals are
subject to NFCU approval; 8) If your payment is made through Payroll Deduction, your payment will be
deposited into your NFCU membership savings account.
