MarketScan includes private sector health benefits claims and enrollment data from approximately 100
payers.
The dataset contains more than 35 million commercially insured lives.
The dataset consists of person-specific clinical utilization, expenditures and enrollment across
inpatient, outpatient, prescription drug, and carve-out services from a selection of large
employers, health plans, and government and public organizations.
The MarketScan databases link paid claims and encounter data to detailed patient demographic
information across sites and types of providers over time.
We used years 2010-2014 for this analysis.
We identified patients with an initial cancer diagnosis in 2011.
The date of service for the earliest identifying cancer claim in 2011 was designated the patientâ€™s
DIAGNOSIS DATE.
Cancer patients were excluded from the study if they met any of the following conditions:.
Cancer patients were identified as individuals with cancer ICD-9 codes in any position on qualified
claims, which are described in the table below.
Patients were required to have a cancer ICD-9 code on one inpatient, or one observation, or two or
more non-acute inpatient, outpatient, emergency department, or evaluation and management services
that occur within 90 days of each other, and where the first of the two services (but not
necessarily both) was incurred in 2011.
Qualified claims were identified by the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) or Revenue codes
below:.
