As reflected in the statutory new drug and new animal drug approval standards in sections 505 109
and 512 of the FD&C Act and the standard for licensure under section 351 of the PHS Act, the 110
evidence that is the basis for the risk assessment of a drug differs from the evidence that is the
111 basis for an effectiveness determination.
The effectiveness determination is generally intended 112 to evaluate a drug’s positive effect based
on adequate and well-controlled trials designed to 113 evaluate a specific efficacy variable (or a
discrete number of efficacy variables) for the purpose 114 of distinguishing the effect of the drug
from other influences.11 In contrast, FDA’s premarket 115 risk assessment is intended to identify
and characterize the nature, frequency, and severity of the 116 usually broad spectrum of adverse
events and other risks associated with the use of a product 117 based on a range of data sources.
For human drugs, the supporting data are generally not derived 118 from studies designed to test a
specific safety hypothesis.
The assessment is based largely on 119 observations of adverse events from studies intended to
assess effectiveness and includes all 120 patients exposed to the investigational drug during its
development.
For animal drugs, there are 121 generally data from safety studies in the target animal, in addition
to observations of adverse 122 events from studies intended to assess effectiveness.12 For both
human and animal drugs, 123 relevant data are weighted and integrated, based on the nature and
reliability of the data sources, 124 into a coherent assessment of what adverse reactions are
reasonably associated with the use of a 125 product and, to the extent possible, their frequency and
severity.13 126.
Risk information is presented in various sections of the approved labeling.
The ADVERSE REACTIONS section is the repository for all adverse reactions associated with a drug.
Depending on the seriousness or other important clinical implications of an adverse reaction, it may
also be discussed in greater detail in other labeling sections, in particular the WARNINGS AND
PRECAUTIONS, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and BOXED WARNING sections.14 For example, the ADVERSE REACTIONS
section of approved human drug labeling is explicitly required to “describe the overall adverse
reaction profile of the drug based on the entire safety database.”15 The threshold for inclusion of
an adverse event16 in approved human drug labeling is a determination that “there is some basis to
believe there is a causal relationship between the drug and the occurrence of the adverse event.”17
Whether there is some basis to believe there is a causal relationship is a matter of judgment based
on factors such as: (1) the frequency of reporting of the event, (2) whether the adverse event rate
for a drug exceeds the placebo rate, (3) the extent of dose-response, (4) the extent to which the
adverse event is consistent with the pharmacology of the drug, (5) the timing of the event relative
to the time of drug exposure, (6).

12 Target animals are the specific animals (e.g., species, class, etc.) for which the drug is intended for use. This draft
guidance  pertains only to risk information relevant to target animal safety. The  Agency  conducts  a separate review
with respect to the human  food  safety of drugs given to food animals  which  takes different factors into account.

premarket  assessment  of safety to support drug approval.

16 The term adverse  event refers to the universe of untoward  medical occurrences  observed  in conjunction  with
exposure  to a drug, whether or not considered  drug-related (see 21 CFR   312.32(a)). Adverse   reactions are a subset
of adverse events  for which there is evidence to conclude  there is some basis to believe there is a causal relationship
between  the drug and  the adverse event (see 21 CFR   201.57(c)(7)).
