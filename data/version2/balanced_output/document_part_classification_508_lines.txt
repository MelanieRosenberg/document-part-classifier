Nevertheless, underrepresented minority students should not be discouraged from applying to
osteopathic med- ical schools based on the current student population’s racial composition.
These statistics are simply statistics and do not in any way reflect bias against minorities within
the osteopathic medical profession.
Also, while osteo- pathic medical students have historically been older than their allopathic
counterparts, the average age of students matriculating into osteopathic schools seems to be getting
progressively younger every year.
In 2012, it was 25 years old, not much older than the average age of MD school matriculants in the
same year, which was 24.22, 23 If becoming a physician is your goal, the statistics and information
provided above should be enough to show that there are indeed two similar, legitimate paths you can
take to become trained as a physician in the United States.
As we have also pointed out, however, there are several fundamental differences between allopathic
and osteo- pathic education and practice.
In the next chapter, we will discuss the history and origin of osteopathic philosophy in order to
explain how this profession’s foundation was laid over a century ago.
