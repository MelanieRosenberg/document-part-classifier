Protocol (IP) addresses] were gathered monthly for the first year from the journal websites.
Known robot activity (software robots downloading all free material for indexing purposes, e.g.,
Google) was removed from the data set before analysis to arrive at a more accurate estimate of human
activity.
Citation figures were gathered monthly from the Web of Science (http://www.isiknowledge.com) for the
first 3 yr after article publication.
While journals control the primary access route to articles, it is common in some disciplines and at
some institutions for authors to self-archive some version of their articles on public websites or
in digital repositories.
To obtain an estimate of the extent and effects of self-archiving, we wrote a Perl script to search
for PDF copies of articles anywhere on the Internet (ignoring the publisher’s website) 1 yr after
publication.
We attempted to identify as many instances of self-archiving as possible, while minimizing the
number of false positives.
Readership analysis was conducted on the 20 science journals in our data set (n(cid:1)2903).
Articles published in the social sciences and humanities journals (n(cid:1)350) were omitted from
the readership analysis, as many did not include abstract or full-text versions of their articles,
and, in some cases, refer- ence views were added to full-text views, resulting in indeter- minate
and incomparable results.
Citation analyses were conducted on the entire article data set (n(cid:1)3245).
A logistic regression model was used to estimate the likelihood of articles in each experimental
group being cited within the first year after publication, controlling for journal and journal
category effects.
Multivariate linear regression models were used to estimate the effect of the open access treatment
on article readership and citations.
Covariates in these models include the journal in which the article appeared, type of article
(review, other), length of article (in pages), number of authors, and whether the article was
self-archived.
Continuous variables (page length, number of authors, and number of citations) were log transformed
to adhere to the assumption of normality re- quired for linear regression.
As we were not interested in estimating citation effects for each particular journal, but to control
for the variation in journal effects generally, journals were considered random effects in the
regression models.
In analyzing article citations, 1 was added to each citation count prior to log transformation as
some articles received 0 citations during the observation period.
While adding 1 shifts the citation distribution to the right, we were interested primarily in the
slopes of the regression lines and not their intercepts.
To interpret the results of the regression equation, estimates of log-transformed variables were
exponentiated in order to arrive at their multiplicative effect (ME).
For exam- ple, if the logCitation estimate were 0.5, the ME of this estimate would be e0.5 or 1.65,
representing a 65% increase in citations.
(HTML) downloads on average (115%; 95% CI, 103– 129%) and, to a lesser degree, a significant
increase in the number of full image (PDF) downloads (62%; 95% CI, 53–72%).
As measured by IP addresses, freely accessible articles received roughly a third more unique
visitors (31%; 95% CI, 25–37%), while abstract views decreased by 22% (95% CI, (cid:2)18 to
(cid:2)26%).
Open access articles were cited no more frequently than subscription-access articles.
The estimate of cita- tion effect at 3 yr was (cid:3)1%, statistically indistinguish- able from 0
(ME 1.01; 95% CI, 0.95–1.08; P(cid:1)0.669; Table 2).
Earlier citation estimates revealed similarly small, nonsignificant results (3% at 12 mo, 4% at 18
mo, 2% at 24 mo, and 2% at 30 mo).
Figure 1 provides a visual comparison of results by subject category.
In comparison, review articles, the number of au- thors, and page length were all significant
predictors of article citations (Table 1).
Articles that were self-ar- chived showed a positive effect on citations ((cid:3)11%), although this
estimate was not significant (ME 1.11; 95% CI, 0.92–1.33; P (cid:1) 0.266).
Just 65 articles (2%) in our data set were self-archived, however, limiting the statistical power of
our test.
Openaccessarticleswerenomorelikelytobecitedwithin their first year (odds ratio 0.96; P(cid:1)0.74;
Table 3).
The percentage of articles that received at least 1 citation within their first year ranged from
just 10% for the humanities journals to nearly all (97.5%) for the multi- disciplinary journal.
None of the journals—analyzed to- gether or in subject groupings—show significant odds.
