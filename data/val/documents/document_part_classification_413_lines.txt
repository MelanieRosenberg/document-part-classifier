As depicted by the line graph in each of the charts below, total healthcare spending on a per
patient basis spikes in the month of diagnosis (month 0) for lung and colorectal cancer or the month
following diagnosis (month 1) for breast cancer, and then steadily declines for months until
leveling off after the first year.
The observed increase before diagnosis is consistent with medical services leading to diagnosis.
