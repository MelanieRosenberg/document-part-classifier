Use of recommended colorectal cancer screening tests can both detect cancer early, when treatment is more effective, and pre- vent cancer, through the detection and removal of precancerous polyps.
However, in 2013, only 59% of adults 50 years of age and older reported receiving colorectal cancer screening according to guidelines.81.
Treatment for cancers of the colon and rectum varies by tumor location, characteristics, and stage.
Surgical procedures for colorectal cancer include local tumor excision or destruction, colectomy (removal of all or part of the colon), proctectomy (removal of the rectum), and proctocolectomy (removal of the rectum and all or part of the colon).
The majority of early stage (I and II) colon cancers are treated with colectomy alone (84%), while most patients with stage III disease receive chemotherapy in addition to surgery (67%) (Figure 6, page 11).
For rectal cancer, 61% of stage I patients have a proctectomy or proctocolectomy, about half of whom also receive radiation and/ or chemotherapy (Figure 7).
In contrast to colon cancer, stage II and III rectal cancers are often treated with chemotherapy com- bined with radiation before surgery (neoadjuvant).  Chemotherapy is the main treatment for metastatic rectal cancer, although in some cases surgery is possible.
A number of targeted drugs are also available to treat metastatic disease.
For patients undergoing surgery, an ostomy (creation of an abdominal opening, or stoma, for elimination of body waste) may be needed.  A colostomy is when a stoma is created from the large intestine, and an ileostomy is when it is created from the small intestine.
In many cases, once the colon or rectum heals,.
the stoma is closed and the ends of the large intestine recon- nected in a procedure called colostomy reversal.
Rectal cancer patients require a colostomy more often than colon cancer patients (29% versus 12%, respectively).82 A permanent colos- tomy may be required if the anus and the sphincter muscle are removed during surgery.
The 5- and 10-year relative survival rates for colorectal cancer are 65% and 58%, respectively.
When colorectal cancer is detected at an early stage, the 5-year survival rate is 90% (Figure 5, page 9); however, only 39% of cases are diagnosed at this stage (Figure 4, page 8), in part due to the underuse of screening.
Long-term survivors of colorectal cancer report a good overall quality of life compared with that of the general population, but higher rates of depression.83 In addition, some difficulty with chronic diarrhea occurs in about one-half of colorectal cancer survivors.84 Bowel dysfunction (including
increased stool fre- quency, incontinence, and perianal irritation) is common among rectal cancer survivors, especially those treated with pelvic radiation.85, 86 In addition, survivors may suffer from bladder dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, and negative body image.40, 87 Many of these issues are
more common in rectal cancer survi- vors, particularly those with a colostomy.88 A trained ostomy therapist may be able to address several of these concerns, as well as issues that arise from colostomy care, such as skin irrita- tion and dietary considerations.89.
In the last few years there has been more research devoted to CAM.  However, there still remain many obstacles for CAM to be integrated into cancer treatment, especially lung cancer.
The lack of resources (plants) to produce these herbal remedies could result in inadequate supply for the potentially high demand.  The technology required for plant extraction and mixture preparation is another hurdle in establishing an adequate supply.  Another obstacle is the lack of.

the other two strengths.  This is highly likely a result of the biased training dataset, which contains a large number of medium strength relationships as shown in Table 5.  Table 11.  Strength prediction results using different feature sets.
Feature notations: 1--Penn Treebank based Unigram), 2- -unigrams with WordNet based POS correction, 3--Binary semantics-based features), 4--K-ary semantics-based features, 5--unary semantics based features, and 6--bigrams.  A linear kernel is used to general all the results.
The standard error is that of the overall accuracy.
In this paper, we describe a novel feature space designed to effectively classify the polarity and strength of relationships extracted from biomedical abstracts.
In addition to the conventional syntactic features such as unigrams and bigrams, we have also explored and constructed semantics-based sequential features.  These features are constructed at three different levels: entity, phrase, and sentence.
A wrapper-based method is then used to select the optimal feature sets for both polarity and strength prediction.  Specifically, a multi-stage SVM classifier and an SVR predictor are built for polarity and strength prediction, respectively.  Two different schemas, namely, (1 vs.  all) and (2 vs.
2), are employed to build the multi-stage SVM.  Finally, three different kernel functions are considered at different stage of this SVM classifier.  Our intensive evaluations have shown that for polarity prediction, the (2 vs.  2) schema in general works better than the (1 vs.  all).
It produces the highest polarity accuracy of 0.91 when both unigrams and semantics-based sequential structures (KSS) are used, with a standard error ranging between 0.01~0.02.  On the other hand, we find that for strength prediction, unigrams solely can produce satisfying results.
We obtain a high accuracy of 0.96, with the standard error ranging between 0.61%~0.63% for the strength analysis.  We are currently expanding our annotated corpus to facilitate further validation of the findings reported in this work.
We are also integrating this module with other modules as shown in Figure 1 towards building a quantitative food-disease-gene network.  Finally, we are creating an interactive user interface to visually present this network.

Effective immediately, hospitals shall notify an EMS provider if a patient transported to the hospital by that provider’s EMS crew subsequently tests positive for the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus.  Notification must occur within 48 hours of the positive test result.
This is a change from the previous 12-hour notification requirement.  Notification of a positive test result is required regardless of whether CDC’s recommended use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during transport of any individual with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 was observed.
Notification shall not include the name of the patient who tested positive.
• Section 6.08 (a) - Every hospital shall provide notification as required in this Section to police officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians, private emergency medical services providers, and ambulance personnel who have provided or are about to provide transport services, emergency
care, or life support services to a patient who has been diagnosed as having a dangerous communicable or infectious disease.
Such notification shall not include the name of the patient, and the emergency services provider agency and any person receiving such notification shall treat the information received as a confidential medical record.
• Section 6.08(c) - The hospital shall send the letter of notification no later than 48 hours after a confirmed diagnosis of any of the bloodborne communicable diseases listed by the Department pursuant to subsection (b).

General recommendations are: the steel angles should be at least 1/4 in.  (6A mm) thick; the horizontal leg should be at least 3-1/2 in.  (89 mm) for use with nominal 4 in.  (100 mm) thick brick and 3 in.  (75 mm) for use with nominal 3 in.  (75 mm) thick brick.
The minimum required bearing length on each end of the fireplace opening is 4 in.  (100 mm).  Steel angle lintels should have a space at their ends to permit thermal expansion.
Combustion Chamber.  The shape and depth of the combustion chamber will greatly influence draft, combustion air requirements and the amount of heat reflected and radiated into the room.  Figure 1 illustrates the shape and Table 1 provides recommended dimensions for the combustion chamber.
These dimensions may be varied slightly, but the information given is based on successful designs.  Significant changes should not be made without consulting a fireplace design consultant.
The sides and lower portion of the back of the combustion chamber should be vertical.  Above the vertical portion of the back, the brick should be sloped forward towards the fireplace opening to support the metal damper and the clay flue lining.
For the maximum amount of reflected heat into the room, the sloped portion of the back should be plane rather than concave.  If it is concave, more heat will be reflected back into the fire rather than into the room.
Greater splay of the sides also increases the amount of heat reflected into the room.
The combustion chamber should be constructed of nominal 4 in.  (100 mm) thick brick.  When refractory brick or firebrick are used, model building codes permit the total wall thickness to be reduced.  Thin mortar joints, not more than 1/4 in.(6.4 mm), should be specified.  A 1 in.
(25 mm) air space should be provided between the combustion chamber wall and the backup wall, although not required by building codes.  This air space provides for thermal expansion of the combustion chamber.
A noncombustible, compressible, fibrous insulation or similar material should be wrapped around the combustion chamber to ensure that this air space is maintained.  The backup wall should be no less than 4 in.
(100 mm) in thickness around the back of the combustion chamber to support the loads from the smoke chamber and chimney above.
Throat.  The throat is a slot-like opening directly above the top of the firebox through which flames, smoke and combustion gases pass into the smoke chamber and upward through the chimney.  Because of its effect on draft, the throat of the fireplace should be carefully designed.
It should be a minimum of 8 in.  (200 mm) above the highest point of the fireplace opening.  The throat is illustrated in Fig.  1a and appropriate dimensions are found in Table 1.
Cast refractory and formed clay throats are available, built to certain angles and dimensions to fit most conventional fireplace dimensions.  These elements are positioned on top of the firebox walls and eliminate the need of constructing brick courses to form the throat.
Once in place, brick masonry can be built around the throat to give the appearance of conventionally built throats in the breastwork of the fireplace.
Damper-The damper closes the fireplace opening to exterior air infiltration and can be used to control the burning rate of the fireplace. A metal damper may be placed in the throat, extending the full width of the throat opening, or at the top of the chimney.

We report the results for four experiments in this pa- per: i) the results of using the IDF stoplist over a ba- sic stoplist, ii) the results of our approach using dif- ferent context descriptions of the possible concepts of a target word, iii) the results of our approach com- pared to SenseClusters
and Humphrey et al.
(2006) using the NLM-WSD dataset, and iv) the results of our approach compared to SenseClusters using the con(cid:3)ated dataset.  The results of using an individualized IDF stoplist for each target word show an improvement over us- ing the basic stoplist.
The results of our approach using different context descriptions show that for the NLM-WSD dataset the large differences in accuracy makes it unclear which of the context descriptions performed the best.
On the con(cid:3)ated dataset, adding the ST de(cid:2)nition to the context description improved.
When analyzing the data, we found that there does not exist a CUI de(cid:2)nition for a large number of pos- sible concepts.  Table 5 shows the number of words in the CUI and ST de(cid:2)nitions for each concept in the NLM-WSD dataset.
Only four target words have a CUI de(cid:2)nition for each possible concept.  We also found the concept de(cid:2)nitions vary widely in length.  The CUI de(cid:2)nitions in the UMLS come from a va- riety of sources and there may exist more than one de(cid:2)nition per source.
Unlike CUI de(cid:2)nitions, there does exist an ST de(cid:2)nition for each possible con- cept.  The ST de(cid:2)nitions come from the same source and are approximately the same length but they are a broad categorization.
We believe this makes them too coarse grained to provide descriptive enough in- formation about their associated concepts.

Estou ciente que: A cirurgia do trauma ocular caracteriza-se por ser uma cirurgia de urgência visando recuperar a melhor função visual possível com a melhora estética.  A anestesia costuma ser geral realizada por anestesiologista especialista.
Em alguns casos o médico pode optar pela local que também será assistida por um médico anestesiologista.  Trata-se de uma cirurgia onde o médico oftalmologista não pode prever os resultados e esta pode ser a primeira de outras cirurgias que poderão ser necessárias.
É uma cirurgia com índices altos de complicações se comparada com as cirurgias eletivas.  Podem ocorrer:.
a) Falha em obter sucesso operatório; b) Infecção; c) Inflamação crônica; d) Dor ocular crônica; e) Cicatriz corneana; f) Aumento da pressão ocular (Glaucoma); g) Catarata; h) Deslocamento de retina; i) Estrabismo; j) Visão dupla; k) Flacidez ou irregularidade das pálpebras; l) Atrofia do nervo
óptico; m) Perda parcial ou total da visão; n) Atrofia e perda do globo ocular.
As chances de melhora e os riscos de complicações variam de acordo com a lesão, tempo de evolução, presença ou não de alterações oculares prévias e/ou alterações sistêmicas concomi- tantes.
A indicação da cirurgia é de decisão do médico examinador que vê a possibilidade de oferecer um resultado melhor se a cirurgia for realizada do que se ela não for.
Summary of C57BL/6 mice infected with GFP-expressing P.  berghei sporozoites and treated with metformin, primaquine, and mefloquine, alone or in combination as described in Figures 1 and 3.  Prepatency was determined by detecting the presence of GFP+ red blood cells via flow cytometry analysis.
The number of mice carrying parasites on days 3 (72 hours) and 5 after sporozoite injection is shown.  The total number of infected mice is given in parentheses.  The number of mice alive on day 10 is also shown.
under mefloquine or metformin single-drug treatments (P = 0.013 and P = 0.041; Figure 3C).  Of note, mice under single or combined metformin treatments showed an extended survival, whereas 84% of the nontreat- ed mice succumbed within 1 week after infection (Table 1).
In conclusion, metformin treatment in combi- nation with suboptimal dosage of conventional antimalarials is more efficacious in reducing parasite load.
Metformin is listed by the World Health Organization as an essential medicine to treat and prevent type 2 diabetes.  As a biguanide, metformin is related to guanidine and galegine, which can both be extracted from goat’s rue (Galega officionalis).
This medicinal plant was traditionally used in medieval Europe as a treat- ment for diabetes and other ailments, including infections such as the plague and typhoid fever.
Metformin was first synthesized in 1922, but its use as an antidiabetic agent was only proposed in 1957, a discovery closely linked to malaria owing to the structural relatedness of metformin to proguanil, a highly potent antimalarial biguanide.
In the 1940s, metformin was tested in patients with an ongoing malaria blood stage infection while a search was underway for alternatives to proguanil, which was becoming ineffective because of parasite resistance (34, 37).
Although no clear effect on parasitemia was found (34), lowered glucose levels were later noticed after metformin treatment (37).  Indeed, the antihyperglycemia property appears to be common to most biguanides, but metformin outperforms with minimal lactic acidosis.
With a long track record of clinical use, metformin has proved to be highly tolerable, with a strong safety profile and few interactions with other medications.
In addition, metformin is water-soluble, is orally bioavail- able, has excellent pharmacokinetic adsorption and excretion properties, and has a low cost of production, making it highly affordable and accessible (37, 38).
These properties contribute to metformin’s qualifications as an optimal drug for repurposing (39).
Interest in metformin repurposing has been sparked in recent years because of numerous epidemiologic observations and meta-analyses demonstrating positive outcomes and improved prognosis in diabetes patients diagnosed with cancer.
To date more than 100 clinical trials in oncolo- gy are underway to determine the benefits of metformin as adjunctive therapy in treating and preventing cancer and longevity-related causes, such as inflammation, senescence, and oxidative damage (39–41).
It is also being studied as a potential adjunctive therapy to treat infections such as tuberculosis (25, 42) and AIDS (43).
The mechanism of action of metformin is not fully defined because it appears to have multiple pleio- tropic direct and indirect effects on various cell processes and cell targets.
In the treatment of diabetes, metformin is widely used to decrease glucose production and output from the liver and increase circulating insulin sensitivity.
These effects are thought to be a result of metformin’s interaction with mitochondria, where it alters cellular bioenergetics by inhibiting the respiratory chain complex I.
This leads to a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation and subsequent drop in energy with altered ADP-to-ATP ratios (22, 44, 45).  As a consequence, several pathways are affected, such as through the activation of the energy sensor AMPK and a shutdown in gluconeogenesis (46–48).
AMPK-dependent processes that are altered include suppression of mTOR and insulin receptor signaling (IGF-I) via PI3K/AKT pathways, leading to decreased protein synthesis and cell growth and increased apoptosis and autophagy (49).  Other mechanisms independent of.

Profit control is an effective measure to manage medicine prices insofar as the regulators have control over the supply of medicines at certain points along the supply chain.  Typically, this means that the regulator needs to have full visibility of the supply and distribution chains.
The regulator also needs to have the capacity and ability to enforce non-compliance.  Profit control is most effective when there is a publicly- funded universal programme for the provision of medicines.
In contrast, it may be much less effective in health care settings where the private sector plays a significant role in the delivery of medicines, or where the structure of supply chain is complex or under-developed (183).
Some countries may place limits on the frequency and magnitude of price increments, or even impose a price freeze or price reduction (161,184).  In the latter, pharmaceutical prices cannot be raised for a predetermined period of time unless there is a justification.
For example, since August 2010 (and at least until 2022), Germany has implemented a moratorium to halt price increase for medicines that are not subject to reference pricing, except for inflation (185).
In Canada, the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board requires holders of medicine patents “to file information about the prices and sales of their patented drug products in Canada at introduction and then twice a year until the patent expires”, as set out by the Patent Act.
The Board considers the average price of specific strength and dosage of a medicine to assess if a product is priced excessively according to the following criteria (186):.
The originator company may file a Voluntary Compliance Undertaking to express its commitment to adjusting the price of the patented medicine in question to a non-excessive level and offsetting any excess revenues, in compliance to the Board’s guidelines.
Medicines that have filed a Voluntary Compliance Undertaking include: panitumumab, pegaspargase, crizotinib, fulvestrant, busulfan, nilotinib (187).
OOP costs in the year of diagnosis came mostly from professional and non-inpatient facility services.  Figure 8 shows the level of OOP costs by percentile for all study cancers combined.  In general, patient cost-sharing is higher for out-of-network services than in-network.
Not surprisingly, cancer patients in the highest decile of OOP spending also incurred the highest portion of OOP costs for out- of-network providers; conversely, patients in the lowest decile incurred the lowest portion of OOP costs for out-of-network providers.
A patient’s decision to use an OON provider selection may be intentional or accidental.
Reasons patients may incur OON costs include patient preference for a particular provider or specialty care center that may be out of network, the lack of network providers with appropriate specialists, and the lack of awareness or transparency about which providers are in the patient’s plan
network.
Common scenarios for accidental use of OON providers are emergency care or care from an OON provider working at an in-network hospital (e.g., radiologist, assistant surgeon, anesthesiologist).22 23 Figure 9 suggests that there might be significant financial consequences to the patient going out of
network, which could be exacerbated if health plans remove popular cancer providers from their networks.
Figure 9 also provides information on the relationship between the OON percentage (right vertical axis--relative to total spending) and total patient cost-sharing (left vertical axis).
While most patients in our study reported under 10% of all OOP cost in the year of diagnosis is spent on out-of- network providers, those in the highest percentile of OOP spending incurred as much as 40% of those costs out-of-network.

explaining this behaviour.  Firstly, as indicated by a widely-cited study by a global consulting firm, increasing price would generate larger improvement in profit than other levers of profit (Fig.  3.7, p.31) (150).
This may have influenced repeated price increases noted in the market for cancer medicines (147,151) and indeed, markets for patented and generic medicines in other therapeutic areas (152–154).
Secondly, as there are many factors influencing demand of medicines other than price (50), it would be sensible for companies focused solely on maximizing profits to focus on price because as it has been said “price is certainty and volume is a bet”.
a physician intentionally stimulates a physiologic response by CO 2 inhalation [31], sodium lactate infusion [32,33], or cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4) injection [32,34].  These chemical exposures are used as potent tools to design controlled studies with predictable levels of PA episodes.
In a study with healthy volunteer subjects using carbon dioxide inhalation to provoke panic and anxiety, propranolol significantly decreased heart rate, a cardiovascular somatic symptom, but did not provide psychic anxiolytic benefit [35].
Propranolol has also been investigated in patients suffering from severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  Two clinical studies of this beta blocker have shown possible benefits in the early-stage interventional prevention and subsequent therapy of PTSD [36,37].
Subsequent reports have also echoed that propranolol might be effective for this condition [38-40], although other reports dispute this conclusion [41,42].
When considered in aggregate these clinical studies of propranolol, as the well known prototypical beta blocker, provide convincing evidence that the drug can exert somatic (i.e., peripheral) effects on the cardiovascular system in the context of panic and anxiety disorders.
With regard to affecting the psychic (CNS) symptoms, the results have been negative, inconsistent, or inconclusive.  That being said, there is some limited evidence that propranolol can exert some psychic (CNS) benefits in clinical stress trials.
In a pair of clinical studies, propranolol (a central and peripheral beta-blocker) significantly enhanced problem solving during stress, whereas nadolol (peripheral only beta-blocker) and lorezapam (benzodiazepine) did not [43, 44].
Thus, propranolol enhanced cognitive flexibility (“creativity”) during stress.  It remains unclear whether propranolol alone can appreciably reduce psychic effects.  In aggregate the clinical evidence does not support a benefit regarding psychic (CNS) anxiety symptoms.
Numerous alternative beta blockers are available in lieu of propranolol.  Notable among these is the common drug, atenolol, that is available in oral solid dose forms ranging from 25 to 100 mg for the treatment of hypertension.  Multiple doses per day may be permitted.
It has been used to suppress stage fright in performers when administered orally in advance [45].  Atenolol is a beta-1 selective peripheral-acting agent without CNS effects, which should reduce the risk for asthmatic subjects [46].
Thus, atenolol might be preferred over the nonselective beta blockers for patients affected by asthma or COPD [47].  Oral atenolol at 50 - 200 mg doses suppressed heart rate by ~ 23 - 24 beats per minute (bpm) vs.  ~ 10 bpm on placebo [46].  Also,.
Another beta blocker is nadolol, which is non-selective and with a preference for beta-1 receptors.  It does not pass through the blood-brain barrier.  In a clinical trial with musicians, nadolol reduced pulse rate and improved one aspect of performance related to tremor [48].
A similar result was obtained for nadolol in students’ singing performance [49].  In spite of being non- selective, nadolol might ironically benefit the pulmonary function in asthma patients based upon the appropriate dosage, an anti-intuitive result [50].
An alternative beta blocker is pindolol, a non-selective agent, which can enhance the effects of co-administered antidepressants and has some 5-HT antagonist property.  Pindolol reduced symptoms of performance anxiety in musicians [51].
Another example is betaxolol that can also cross the blood- brain barrier.  Daily oral betaxalol was delivered at 5 - 40 mg per day in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and other anxiety-related conditions.  Anxiety and panic attacks were reduced within several days [52].
This anxiolytic benefit is prophylactic, as the effects are observed in days, rather than in minutes.
In view of the clinical studies and off-label use of various beta blockers, psychiatrists are aware that beta blockers can provide some symptomatic relief with regard to performance anxiety [53].
However, beta blockers alone do not sufficiently address the aggregate symptoms of panic and acute anxiety episodes, and especially the psychic symptoms thereof (e.g., fear, avoidance, and anxiousness).
Beta blockers also exhibit some benefit with regard to alcohol and drug abuse.  The abuse of alcohol, prescription drugs, and illegal drugs (e.g., opioids, opiates, and cocaine) are major mental health care concerns.
The repetitive abuse of these chemicals can produce physiologic dependence, tolerance, addiction, and neurologic damage.  The symptoms of sudden withdrawal depend upon the abused substance, the impairment of neurological and neuroendocrine pathways, as well as somatic organ impairment.
The withdrawal from addictive substances produces an array of symptoms, many of which overlap with the symptoms of panic and acute anxiety episodes.  Delirium tremens (DTs) occur in some alcoholics upon abrupt cessation of drinking.
The symptoms of alcohol-related DTs are very similar to those of panic attacks, and are in part related to beta adrenergic effects.  The DTs can have serious and even life- threatening consequences.  The standards-of-care for DTs are oral benzodiazepines.
Withdrawal from opioid and/or opiate addiction is physiologically distinct from alcohol withdrawal.
With regard to beta blockers in substance abuse, atenolol has been shown in placebo-controlled trials to be beneficial in alcohol withdrawal [54-56].  Pindolol has been used to treat alcohol withdrawal [57].
Timolol had a minimal effect on a subset of symptoms of patients experiencing alcohol withdrawal [58].With regard to cocaine abuse, propranolol has been used to treat withdrawal and overdoses [59, 60].
Note that propranolol has also been shown to suppress tremors [61], consistent with one of the perceived benefits of beta blockers in performance anxiety in musicians (above).

Nevertheless, underrepresented minority students should not be discouraged from applying to osteopathic med- ical schools based on the current student population’s racial composition.
These statistics are simply statistics and do not in any way reflect bias against minorities within the osteopathic medical profession.
Also, while osteo- pathic medical students have historically been older than their allopathic counterparts, the average age of students matriculating into osteopathic schools seems to be getting progressively younger every year.
In 2012, it was 25 years old, not much older than the average age of MD school matriculants in the same year, which was 24.22, 23 If becoming a physician is your goal, the statistics and information provided above should be enough to show that there are indeed two similar, legitimate paths you can
take to become trained as a physician in the United States.
As we have also pointed out, however, there are several fundamental differences between allopathic and osteo- pathic education and practice.
In the next chapter, we will discuss the history and origin of osteopathic philosophy in order to explain how this profession’s foundation was laid over a century ago.

We find 8,436 matched pairs.  We train logistic regres- sion with the same train-test split (days 1-277, days 278- 365).  Using all features, logistic regression achieves an F1 of 0.6037.
Although many of the positive feature are sensi- ble and similar to those found in the ranking experiments and previous research (Wallace, Paul, and Elhadad 2015; Zhang et al.  2016), we find that the negative features are dominated by alzheimers and dementia related terms in the title and abstract.
These results are indicative of an oddity in the dataset provided by Altmetric, specifically the web- site Alzforum.  Alzforum is an information resource web- site for alzheimers researchers and is one of the websites included in Altmetric’s news crawl.
Most of the Alzforum articles tracked by Altmetric post only article metadata, and the website was marked as a non-news source due to its super high rate of publication.
Before sampling, Alzforum covers 8,347 of the 34,329 scientific articles with no real coverage and is the highest frequency outlet on that subset.  However, it covers only 667 of the 57,668 scientific articles with real coverage.
Of 8,436 matched pairs, Alzforum cov- ers 1,380 negative and 224 positive samples.
Although we control for subjects, they are typically more general, such as “neuroscience,” “psychology and cognitive sciences,” and “geriatrics and gerontology.” Thus, we are unable to control for specific topics, such as alzheimers, and logistic regres- sion learns that most alzheimers articles are
unpopular.
Similar to the ranking experiments, we repeat the matched sample experiment on the subset of articles which received a press release.  We find 3,398 matched pairs and confirm that the positive and negative instances do not have dispro- portionate skew towards any one outlet.
Using all features, logistic regression achieves an F1 of 0.5794.  Table 7 lists the top features for these results.
Top negative features ap- pear to be those related to more technical scientific work, such as “proteins” and “genes” “expression”, while positive features are related to health, such as “fat,” “screening,” and “Project HOPE,” a publisher of health policy articles.
Sur- prisingly, the American Chemical Society is a positive fea- ture and “medicine” is a negative feature when occurring in the title.
In this paper we present an analysis of news coverage of sci- entific articles across various disciplines, universities, jour- nals, and news outlets.  After filtering out press release and abstractissuanceandcopierwebsites,weapproachtheprob- lem as a ranking one.
For a given period of time, we learn to rank scientific articles by the amount of news coverage they receive.
We find that textual features significantly im- prove the accuracy of the prediction over metadata features, with abstract and press release features providing the largest boost in accuracy.  We find the most important feature to be whether the scientific article has a press release published.

Masonry Units.  Information on classification and selection of brick can be found in Technical Notes 9A and 9B, respectively.
Further information on brick masonry material selection for adequate strength and compliance with the Masonry Standards Joint Committee (MSJC) Code and Specification can be found in Technical Notes 3 Series.
Concrete masonry units are usually used for the interior wythe of a cavity wall in combination with a brick masonry exterior.  They may also be used as accent bands in the exterior brick wythe.
Hollow or solid concrete masonry units should conform to ASTM C 55 Specification for Concrete Building Brick, ASTM C 90 Specification for Loadbearing Concrete Masonry Units or ASTM C 129 Specification for Non-Loadbearing Concrete Masonry Units.
Non load- bearing concrete masonry units are usually specified for the interior wythe when the brick and block cavity wall is used as infill walls for concrete or steel frame structural systems if shear loads are not transmitted to that wythe.
Structural clay tile has been used as a backing material for cavity wall construction.  Structural clay tile for this purpose should conform to ASTM C 126, ASTM C 34 Specification for Structural Clay Load-Bearing Wall Tile or ASTM C 212 for Structural Clay Facing Tile.
Clay tile units under ASTM C 126 and ASTM C 212 are commonly used for the interior wythe of a cavity wall when left exposed for architectural appearance reasons.
The strength and moisture penetration resistance of a brick masonry cavity wall are affected by the mortar selection and compatibility with the brick units.  Portland cement-lime, mortar cement, or masonry cement mortars can be used.
However, mortars with an air content less than 12 percent are recommended for their superior bond strength and resistance to moisture penetration.
The MSJC Code requires that the allowable flexural tensile stresses be reduced by approximately 50 percent for assemblies constructed with masonry cement mortars or portland cement-lime mortars that have air entrainment.
In addition, some building codes prohibit the use of masonry cement mortars and all Type N mortars in Seismic Performance Categories D and E (formerly Seismic Zones 3 and 4).  Mortar should meet the proportion requirements of ASTM C 270 Specification for Mortar for Unit Masonry as shown in Table 1.
Mortar type selection should be based on project requirements, such as strength and compatibility with a particular brick unit.  Types N or S mortars are typically used in brick masonry cavity walls.  See Technical Notes 8 Series for more detailed information on mortar types and selection.

The growing expenditure and high prices of cancer medicines have attracted an extensive body of commentary from diverse stakeholders in recent years.
Stakeholders at all levels – from patients and clinicians to governments – have expressed their concerns that such high prices would compromise the availability and affordability of these medicines to patients, as well as the sustainability of health systems.
For example, in 2011, the Lancet Oncology Commission on Global Cancer in cancer policy” and that “cancer profession and industry should take responsibility and not accept a substandard evidence base and an ethos of very small benefit at whatever cost; rather, we need delivery of fair prices and real
value from new technologies” (28).
In 2012, an article published in the New York Times highlighted that ignoring the cost of cancer treatment was “not tenable” (29).  In 2013, a group of more than 100 experts in chronic myeloid leukaemia pointed to Stakeholders concerns adequate medicines.
the fact that 11 of the 12 medicines approved by the United States Food & Drug Administration (US FDA) in 2012 for various cancer indications were priced above US$ 100 000 per year.
The experts asserted that the prices of these medicines were too high, unsustainable, might compromise access of needy patients to highly effective therapy, and harmful to the sustainability of national health care systems (30).
Similarly, in 2015, yet another group of cancer experts have petitioned for lower medicine prices (31).
Despite the chorus of concerns, existing regulatory and non-regulatory measures do not seem to have suitably resulted in outcomes that meet both policy and economic objectives, as well as public expectations.
Stakeholders continue to voice their concerns about the lack of adequate access to both new and off-patent essential cancer medicines.
Furthermore, the prices of cancer medicines continue to rise significantly, possibly disproportionally to the benefits conferred and to the extent that the financial sustainability of.
Oklahoma State Law and the federal No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) require that we identify whether students in our school district are English Language Learners (ELL).  Both of these laws require a language instruction educational program for ELL students with limited English proficiency (LEP).
The identification process and placement of your child in a language instruction educational program is based on a combination of the home language questionnaire, teacher judgment, English test results and other measures.  Your child’s English proficiency test scores are shown below.
Your child has been identified as needing services for English Language Learners (ELL).  Your child will be placed in the ESL/Bilingual Education dual language immersion program, as outlined in the attached document.
We believe that this program will help meet your child’s educational needs and enhance his/her academic success in school.  Your child will be assessed twice yearly, or as needed, to determine progress toward individual ELL goals.
When your child scores in the acceptable range (4.5 Literacy/5.0 Overall) on all areas of the W-APT or ACCESS assessment they will be exited from the program.
If your student currently has an Individualized Education Program (IEP), their needs will continue to be met through their current accommodations.
You may withdraw your child from services at any time you desire.  You may also mark the appropriate box at the bottom of this form.  Your child will then be placed in the regular instruction programs for students who are fluent in English.
Please seriously consider the consequences of your decision on your child’s long-term educational success.  We invite you to visit the school and meet with our staff to learn more about the benefit of the program and other services available at the school.
If you have questions, please call the school at 1.580.323.1800.
The preceding paper explains the process and evidence used to develop policies for the Journal of Forecasting.  Many, though not all, of the policies have been adopted for the Journal.
The policies are reflected in the “Guidelines for Authors” published on the back cover of this issue and in the “Guidelines for Referees,” in the appendix of this paper.  (A complete Editorial manual is available from the editors.).
We feel that the Journal of Forecasting policies are ambitious.  We propose these policies as a way to obtain better papers and to help authors to increase the likelihood of publication.  However, violations of these guidelines will not eliminate a paper as a candidate for publication.
We would not be so bold as to suggest these policies define the best procedures for all authors, associate editors, or referees.  The policies should be an aid, not a restriction.
As you know, my office represents the City and County of San Francisco, including its Health Officer Dr.  Aragón, who has issued a stay-safe-at-home order and related health orders to protect the residents of this City during this unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic.
(See https://www.sfdph.org/dph/alerts/coronavirus-healthorders.asp.) Dr.
Aragón understands and respects the importance of religion to the spiritual well-being and mental health of many, and accordingly has encouraged San Franciscans to continue to practice their religious faith in all ways that are safe.
It is for this reason that the Health Officer issued a revised health order on June 11, 2020 (Order of the Health Officer No.
C19-07e, the “Health Order”), which allows for in-person outdoor services conducted according to science-based safeguards that will minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission.
Unfortunately, and contrary to increasing medical evidence that religious services without safeguards have caused serious outbreaks in many other cities and counties throughout the country, the Archdiocese has conducted both indoor and outdoor gatherings over the past three weekends that violate the
Health Order and jeopardize the health and safety of San Franciscans.
These large gatherings of people indoors for a long period, in some instances reported without face coverings and with singing, place clergy, staff, volunteers and congregants alike at heightened risk of transmission of COVID-19, which can lead to serious illness and even death, and endangers the
health of the Archdiocese’s parishioners and the entire community.
Given the recent rise in cases and hospitalizations, Dr.  Aragón’s concerns about these risks have only been heightened.
More particularly, the City understands that Archbishop Cordileone informed all parishes and other worship sites in the Archdiocese, including San Francisco, that they could resume public Mass on Sunday, June 14, 2020.
Upon learning of this direction to the parishes my office sent the Archdiocese an email on Thursday, June 11, 2020 (attached) seeking more information and making sure that the Archdiocese was aware of the San Francisco Health Officer’s determination that indoor services with congregants continue to
pose a serious public health risk and are consequently prohibited under the Health Order for the time being, with a narrow exception for funerals with 12 or fewer persons and an exception for live streaming services with.
Researchers spend a great deal of time reading research pa- pers.  However, this skill is rarely taught, leading to much wasted effort.  This article outlines a practical and efficient three-pass method for reading research papers.  I also de- scribe how to use this method to do a literature survey.
Categories and Subject Descriptors: A.1 [Introductory and Survey].
Researchers must read papers for several reasons: to re- view them for a conference or a class, to keep current in their field, or for a literature survey of a new field. A typi- cal researcher will likely spend hundreds of hours every year reading papers.
The key idea is that you should read the paper in up to three passes, instead of starting at the beginning and plow- ing your way to the end.  Each pass accomplishes specific goals and builds upon the previous pass: The first pass gives you a general idea about the paper.
The second pass lets you grasp the paper’s content, but not its details.  The third pass helps you understand the paper in depth.
1. Category: What type of paper is this? A measure- ment paper? An analysis of an existing system? A description of a research prototype? 2. Context: Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?
Using this information, you may choose not to read fur- ther.  This could be because the paper doesn’t interest you, or you don’t know enough about the area to understand the paper, or that the authors make invalid assumptions.
The first pass is adequate for papers that aren’t in your research area, but may someday prove relevant.
Incidentally, when you write a paper, you can expect most reviewers (and readers) to make only one pass over it.  Take care to choose coherent section and sub-section titles and to write concise and comprehensive abstracts.
If a reviewer cannot understand the gist after one pass, the paper will likely be rejected; if a reader cannot understand the high- lights of the paper after five minutes, the paper will likely never be read.
The first pass is a quick scan to get a bird’s-eye view of the paper. You can also decide whether you need to do any more passes. This pass should take about five to ten minutes and consists of the following steps:
1.  Look carefully at the figures, diagrams and other illus- trations in the paper.  Pay special attention to graphs.  Are the axes properly labeled.  Are results shown with error bars, so that conclusions are statistically sig- nificant.
Common mistakes like these will separate rushed, shoddy work from the truly excellent.

The rising cost of health care (Saxe et al., 2008), coupled with multiple unmet needs, equates to multiple CAM uses (Mao et al., 2008).  These unmet needs were identified by Mao et al.
(2008) as emotional, physical, nutritional, financial, informational, treatment- and employment-related, and daily living activi- ties.
Other reasons included an identified dissatisfaction with conventional care (Richardson et al., 2000; Saxe et al., 2008), fragmentation of care into survivorship, lack of empathy and support, or if a survivor’s subsequent needs were unfulfilled (Mao et al., 2008).  In addition, Carpenter et al.
(2008) identi- fied decreased emotional function and multiple medical issues in very long-term breast cancer survivors who used CAM.  The potential for recurrence and high levels of worry (Mao et al., 2008) and distress (Lawsin et al., 2007) also were reported with increased use.
Finally, the use of herbal supplements were reportedly used to reduce the side effects of treatment and to boost immune function (Buettner et al., 2006; Deng et al., 2004; Lawsin et al., 2007; Richardson et al., 2000; Saxe et al., 2008).
To provide quality care to the cancer survivor, oncology nurses should understand the characteristics and reasons for CAM use and examine personal views and beliefs regarding CAM.
Once personal biases and beliefs have been identified, the nurse can explore reasons for looking into the use of these therapies with the patient.  Nurses should approach CAM with a non-judgmental attitude (Saxe et al., 2008) to avoid non-report- ing of CAM use by the patient.  Saxe et al.
(2008) and Frenkel et al.  (2005) reported that patients often do not report the use of CAM primarily because of the healthcare provider’s negative attitudes or limited knowledge regarding their use.
Addition- ally, the patient or survivor may choose only to disclose one of multiple CAM therapies that they are using (Saxe et al., 2008).  Robinson and McGrail (2004) reported that disclosure rates of CAM use ranged from 23%–90%.
Chen, Bernard, and Cottrell (1999) demonstrated lower reporting to physicians who did not practice some form of CAM (67%) versus those who did (90%).
Disclosure remains important to consider because patients who are seeing CAM providers and subsequently engaging in CAM treatments in addition to conventional care may cause interrup- tion in their treatment and potential harm to themselves (Saxe et al., 2008).
Cultural sensitivity also is essential for understanding CAM use.  Cultural beliefs are important in the acceptance of, or mistrust with, conventional health care.  This can lead to subse- quent rejection of Western health care (Mao et al., 2008).
Nursing assessment should focus on psychological processes of the patient (Gansler et al., 2008), including fear, quality of life, and spiritual values, as well as feelings of hope, optimism, and personal control (Richardson et al., 2000) (see Table 2).
An evaluation of common characteristics may assist the pro- vider in identification of increased use.
An example of this is that supplement use has been reported to be associated with survivors with increased exercise and dietary changes that in- cluded increased fruit and vegetable intake (Gunther, Patterson, Kristal, Stratton, & White, 2004; Miller et al., 2008).
Preliminary assessment also should include factors such as financial concerns related to care, cancer type, stage, prognosis,.
and end-of-life issues, because diagnoses such as breast cancer are associated with increased CAM use in conjunction with con- ventional treatment (Deng et al., 2004; Mao et al., 2008).  Nurses need to possess a good understanding of the survivor’s motiva- tion surrounding the use of CAM.
Addressing unmet needs, side-effect management, and conducting an evaluation of the patient’s understanding of safety in these therapies is imperative in future survivor care.
Because CAM use is more likely related to symptom treatment, such as pain, fatigue, and hot flashes (Mao et al., 2008), a thorough focus on side-effect management also is an essential component of survivorship.
