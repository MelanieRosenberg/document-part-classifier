      "US$ 50 000 per course) to the final launch price of US$ 84 000 per course. The final price was decided based on an anticipated rise in revenue even though the manufacturer expected the number of patients receiving the medicine would decline (p.43) (100), and various stakeholders would react negatively to the firm\u2019s final pricing of the product. Furthermore, the manufacturer set a high price for Sovaldi with a view to consolidate the market\u2019s price expectation in preparation for setting an even higher price for a combination product that contains sofosbuvir (Harvoni) that would be launched after Sovaldi. It also included an arbitrary price increase from US$ 27 000 per bottle to US$ 28 000 per bottle (i.e. 3.7% increase) because it would \u201cbe easy from the press release, from 28 days and $28,000\u201d (p.57) (100). This example demonstrates that pricing solely according to commercial goals will impair a health system\u2019s ability to achieve public health goals because high prices limit patient access, thereby limiting the full value potential of the innovation.\n</TEXT": 1,

          "In the Biomedical sector, the current applications of data mining are the most successful and they have become the subfield of medical research. The basis for this growth is that nowadays most of the health related data are stored in small datasets scattered through various Hospitals, Clinics and Research centers. The healthcare sector is presently facing both the economic predictability and the methodological prospect of a data based approach for quality administration. Hence, abundant data mining techniques have been proposed to process medical data stream. Applying data mining techniques to the centralized database will offer to doctors investigative and foretelling tools from the surface of the data. Modern clinical practices also undertake transformation not only in diagnosis and treatment methods, but also in understanding of health and illness concepts. Data Mining can generate information that can be useful to all stakeholders in health care, including patients by identifying effective treatments and best practices. Though data mining methods and tools have been applied in diverse areas for more than 40 years already, their applications in healthcare are comparatively young. Therefore, this paper presents a survey on the significance of Data Mining techniques in Disease Diagnosis and Biomedical Research.",

          "Infection Practically in every country, the cost of healthcare is increasing more rapidly than  the readiness\nand  the capability to pay for it. At the same time, more and more data is being obtained  around  healthcare\nprocesses   in the form  of Electronic  Health  Records  (EHR),  health  insurance  claims, medical   imaging\ndatabases,  disease  registries, spontaneous  reporting sites, and clinical trials. As a result, data mining has\nbecome   important  to the healthcare  world. On  the one  hand, EHR  offers the data  that gets data  miners\nexcited. However,  on the other hand,  it is accompanied  by challenges such  as 1) the unavailability of large\nsources  of data to academic   researchers,  and 2) limited access  to data-mining  experts  [6]. But, still the\nquality of health care  service at a cheap  cost  continues  to be a  difficult issue in developing countries.\nAlthough  several countries have  taken  firm steps in providing aid services, the reach of those services  to\nthe poor, still remains as a  difficulty. In different dimensions, un-imaginable  services like separation  of\ndual births, discovery  of latest medicines  for deadly diseases  are  happening.  However,   a few  cases  of\ndeath  occur  due to   poor  clinical diagnosing system   and inadequate   treatment.  Most  of the time, the\nclinical selections are created by  the doctor\u2019s experience  and  skill. Hospitals do have info systems,  call\nSupport  Systems,  Image  and  Scan  process systems.  However,  all hospitals do not have  these facilities or\ntheir applications are restricted.\nCall support systems  with diagnosing  support  for naive doctors and for knowledgeable   doctors would  be a\ntenet for higher clinical cognitive process. The primary initiative is that the prospective costs and effects of\ndiagnosis  can be  measured   and  used  to enhance   the task. Furthermore,   the transitional enquiry steps\nsuch  as asking for more  systematic  studies, or more examination   done  by human   professionals, can  also\nbe  computed   in terms  of  cost and  effect. Based  on  these  cost  and  effect, the system  can  learn  to\nrecommend    the  optimal action. Providing  precious services  at cheap  prices may   be a major  constraint\nencountered   by the  aid organizations  (hospitals, medical centers). Valuable  quality service denotes  the\ncorrect diagnosing   of patients  and  providing  economical   treatment.  Acceptable   computer-based    info\nand/or  call support systems  will aid in achieving clinical tests at a reduced value. Due to the accessibility\nof integrated  info through  huge  patient  repositories, there is a  swing  within the insight of clinicians,",

          "President Obama has recently expressed a strong conviction that \u201cScience offers great potential for improving health\u201d. The President has announced a research initiative that aims to accelerate progress toward a new era of precision medicine. The time is accurate for this idealistic initiative, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other partners will work to attain this vision [7]. The concept of precision medicine speaks of prevention and treatment strategies that take individual variability into account. Even though it is not new, the impact of practicality is still deprived. If one considers blood typing, for instance, has been used to guide blood transfusions for more than a century. But the vision of applying this concept broadly has been intensely improved by the latest development of large-scale biologic databases (such as the human genome sequence), powerful methods for typifying patients (such as proteomics, metabolomics, genomics, diverse cellular assays, and even mobile health technology), and computational tools for analyzing large sets of data.

          "is worth noting that these two long RAIs, as well as the longest introduction in the BESP subcorpus (i.e., BESP5, with 928 words), contained the whole literature review. The only other introduction that also exhausted the literature review was ESPj5. Besides a higher average number of words per RAI, the ESPj subcorpus also had a higher average number of sentences per RAI. The number of paragraphs, however, was smaller in this subcorpus than in the BESP subcorpus. In fact, three of the 10 ESPj introductions only had one paragraph, whereas BESP introductions required at least two. The ratio between the number of sentences and paragraphs shows that eight out of the 10 BESP introductions had fewer than three sentences per paragraph while, in the ESPj corpus, three was the minimum found and the average was 5.2.",

According to the 2014 U.S. News and World Report, a popular source of medical school rankings, osteopathic medical schools rank among the top producers of primary care doctors in the nation, with Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine (MSUCOM) being one of the ten top-ranked medical school in this category.13 Consequently, some cur- ricula may place a greater emphasis on such skills as bed- side manner, interviewing and building the physician- patient relationship. These schools do not in any way force students to go into primary care \u2013 many students simply choose to do so.14",

They are less likely to place as much emphasis on Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) scores and/or GPAs as allopathic schools do.12 These differing criteria may explain some of the existing disparities in average admissions statis- tics between admitted students of osteopathic med- ical schools and those of allopathic medical schools. The 19,517 matriculating allopathic students in 2012 had an average combined MCAT score of 31.2 (Physical Science: 10.5, Verbal Reasoning: 9.8, Biological Science: 10.9) and average GPAs of 3.63, 3.75, and 3.68 for science, non- science, and total, respectively.15 In contrast, the same year, the 5,464 matriculating osteopathic medical students had an average MCAT score of 26.85 (PS: 8.74, VR: 8.63, BS: 9.48) with average science, non-science, and total GPAs of 3.37, 3.59, and 3.49, respectively.16 The other major factor contributing to this disparity is the difference in the actual applicant pools. Currently, the majority of medical school applicants do not apply to osteopathic medical programs, likely due to a general lack of accessible and reliable information concerning osteo- pathic medicine.

Offshore winds are less turbulent (because the ocean is flat relative to onshore topography), and they tend to flow at higher speeds than onshore winds, thus allowing turbines to produce more electricity. Because the potential energy produced from the wind is directly proportional to the cube of the wind speed, increased wind speeds of only a few miles per hour can produce a significantly larger amount of electricity. For instance, a turbine at a site with an average wind speed of 16 mph would produce 50% more electricity than at a site with the same turbine and average wind speeds of 14 mph (Offshore Wind 2006).",

          "As early as 200 B.C., wind was reportedly used to pump water in China and grind grain in the Middle East. Over the centuries, onshore wind has been harnessed to generate power worldwide. In the nineteenth century, settlers in the United States used windmills to generate electricity for homes and pump water for consumption and crop irrigation; industrialization sparked the development of larger windmills to generate electricity for commercial purposes. Interest in wind energy has waxed and waned with the price of fossil fuels. After the 1973 Arab oil embargo, new ways of converting wind energy into useful power were developed. Many of these approaches have been demonstrated in wind facilities (also known as wind farms, wind power plants, or wind projects), which are groups of turbines that feed electricity into the utility grid. Wind facilities began appearing in California in the 1980s, and, today, the cost of onshore wind-generated electricity is close to that generated from conventional utilities in some locations.",

          "The numbers in each block are codes for the treatment given to each animal. The purpose of such a design is to reduce heterogeneity associated with time, space and some physical varia- tion. The five animals in Block 1 would be chosen to be as similar as possible with respect to age, weight, genotype and any other variable which might influence the outcome. They would then be assigned at random to one of the five treatments. The animals would be housed in close proximity, and possibly even in the same cage, if the different treatments can be given in such a situation. When measurements are to be made on the animals, those in Block 1 would be treated as a group, with all measurements being made within a short period by the same per- son. Animals in the other blocks would likewise be selected to be as uniform as possible, but might differ in body weight or age, etc. from those in Block 1. They could be measured at a dif- ferent time, if necessary by a different person. Thus, within each block any comparison among treatments would be made on animals which are in all possible ways as similar as possible. The unwanted variation shows up as differences between blocks. This is then removed mathe- matically in the statistical analysis.",

An estimate of the SD could be obtained from a previous study, from the literature, or from a pilot study. However, all these sources of informa- tion are subject to error. The significance level is usually set, somewhat arbitrarily, at 0.05, and the power is likewise often set at 80(cid:150)90%. Thus, although doing a power analysis is a useful exercise in showing the potential capa- bility of various proposed experiments to detect an effect of biological interest, it does not always give a definitive answer of the most appropriate size of each experiment. It is strongly recommended, therefore, that sam- ple sizes are continually reviewed as experi- mental results become available.",

          "An advantage of a power analysis is that it can be used to explore the implications of negative results, i.e. those in which there is no significant difference between treatment means. Such negative results might be of bio- logical interest, particularly in safety testing, if they are real, but are of little interest if the lack of statistical significance was because the experiment was too small to detect a treatment difference of potential interest. Thus, a power analysis can be used to find out the probability that the experiment would have been able to detect a specified treatment effect if it was really there. For example, in the diet experiment discussed previously, suppose that an experiment had been undertaken to compare the two diets with ten mice per group, and that the mean",

These guidelines were developed in an open industry forum sponsored by the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA) and in accordance with ITU Recommendation E.212. The result of this development effort was the consensus-approved document titled IMSI Assignment Guidelines and Procedures Version 1.0.",

          "These assignment guidelines pertain exclusively to Commercial Mobile Radio Service providers (CMRS). The IMSI Administrator directly administers only the Home Network Identity (HNI) segment of the resource. The HNI uniquely identifies the home wireless network of a FCC- licensed two-way CMRS subscriber and contains the Mobile Country Code (MCC) and the Mobile Network Code (MNC). The remaining segment of the IMSI, the Mobile Station Identification Number (MSIN), is directly administered by the wireless network licensee to which the HNI is assigned. Issue: In 1998, ITU Recommendation E.212 was modified allowing IMSI assignments to those Wireline Service Providers offering limited mobility services. As a result, HNI assignments are no longer available exclusively to CMRS providers. The current IMSI assignment and administrative guidelines do not however reflect these modifications.",

          "islation. The following year, the California State Supreme Court overturned the merger legislation from over a decade prior, thus allowing the reinstatement of an osteo- pathic licensing board, a medical society, and a new school, now known as Western University of Health Sci- ences College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific. How- ever, the emergence of government-sponsored insurance and managed care programs brought about new chal- lenges for the osteopathic profession. DOs were histori- cally severely underrepresented in the decisions regarding Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement for osteopathic medical services. In fact, it was not until 1995 that the first DO was named to serve on the Physician Payment Review Commission, which advised Congress on policy con- cerning such reimbursements. Today, numerous issues, including physician reim- bursement, still surround osteopathic medicine. The most pertinent of these concerns are internship and resi- dency shortages, public awareness and perception, clinical research on OMM, DO-MD relations, and the effort to dis- tinguish DOs from MDs in light of the progressive blurring of distinctions between the two professions. All of these issues are quite complex and are further elaborated on later in this guidebook. 24% Average growth every 5 years in # of DOs since 1985",

          "In the late 1800s, Andrew Taylor Still identified the neuromusculoskeletal system as the key element in health maintenance and stressed preventive aspects of medi- cine in place of drug therapy. During that time, osteop- athy was truly separate and distinct from the world of allo- pathic medicine. Since then, as medicine in general has become more evidence-based and supported by research, osteopathic philosophy has evolved into a more complete and robust osteopathic medicine. The phrase \u201costeopathic medicine\u201d is now the accepted term for the profession over \u201costeopathy,\u201d a now-antiquated term that represents a period when Still championed a near-drugless form of manual medicine. Since its conception, osteopathic med- icine has adapted its body of knowledge to incorporate contemporary scientific thought, including germ theory, pharmacology, and other \u201callopathic\u201d teachings. The cen- tral tenets of osteopathic thought, however, have been maintained and continue to guide DOs in their practice of medicine. Though interprofessional relations between MDs and DOs are better than they have ever been before, challenges still exist in terms of keeping the osteopathic tradition intact, improving the evidence basis of OMM via clinical research, and advocating for widespread recogni- tion of DOs.",

Physicians and patients must exercise their independent clinical discretion and judgment in determining care. Each benefit plan contains its own specific CD Provisions for coverage, limitations, and exclusions as stated in the Member\u2019s Evidence of Coverage (EOC)/Summary of Benefits (SB). If there is a discrepancy between this policy and the member\u2019s EOC/SB, the member\u2019s EOC/SB provision will govern. The information contained in this document is believed to be current as of the date noted. The benefit information in this Coverage Summary is based on existing national coverage policy, however, Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs) may exist and compliance with these policies is required where applicable. There are instances where this document may direct readers to a UnitedHealthcare Commercial Medical Policy, Medical Benefit Drug Policy, and/or Coverage Determination Guideline (CDG). In the absence of a Medicare National Coverage Determination (NCD), Local Coverage Determination (LCD), or other Medicare coverage guidance, CMS allows a Medicare Advantage Organization (MAO) to create its own coverage determinations, using objective evidence-based rationale relying on authoritative evidence (Medicare IOM Pub.

          "Article downloads and citations measure two different dimensions of scientific knowledge transfer. The first measures general interest in a particular new piece of knowledge; the second measures the incorporation of that knowledge into a new document. Most article downloads take place within the first few months after publication (17, 18), suggesting that the primary func- tion of an article is to keep researchers abreast on the latest findings within a field and secondly to serve as a source document for future citation. Article downloads retrieved shortly after publication have been shown to predict future citations, although their strength of prediction is relatively low (17, 19, 20). A citation, on the other hand, measures a different set of intentions from a much smaller group of partic- ipants. To generate new scientific knowledge, in most cases, one must have access to equipment, materials and facilities, technicians, and the infrastructure neces- sary to support and coordinate them all (21). Authors must be able to analyze their results, capable of pre- senting their findings, and able to communicate them clearly and coherently. Once submitted, scientific man- uscripts must make it through peer-review and be published in an indexed journal in order to be visible",

Assessment should determine what interven- tions have been effective for the pain, how the pain af- fects function, the type of pain (eg, neuropathic, visceral, somatic, muscle spasms), and whether there are barriers to effective pain management, such as cultural orlanguagedifferences,cognitivedeficits,orpatientmis- conceptions about pain management (Table 2). In addi- tion, it is not sufficient to assess pain only at rest. Pain that is relativelywell controlled at rest canbe severe dur- ing movement or with specific activities that cause increased pain (eg, swallowing after tonsillectomy), with important implications for symptom management and recovery. The panel suggests that clinicians assess pain at rest and with activities, as the latter is often more severe and difficult to control than pain at rest.110,270 Presence of pain with activity has important implications for use of additional interventions and discharge planning. For example, pain that is well controlled at rest but severe with movement can have major effects on a patient\u2019s ability to participate in postsurgical rehabilitation and return to normal function, and pain with swallowing after tonsillectomy could increase risk for dehydration. Assessments for other clinical issues such as sedation, delirium, and nausea or other side effects related to interventions are also important to help guide decisions regarding adjustmentofthe postoperativepain management plan. There is insufficient evidence to guide firm recom- mendations on optimal timing or frequency of patient reassessments in the postoperative setting. The timing of assessments after administration of an intervention should be informed by the time to achieve peak ef- fects, which is typically 15 to 30 minutes after paren- teral drug therapy or 1 to 2 hours after administration of an oral analgesic. With nonpharma- cologic interventions, pain relief often occurs during or immediately after their application. The optimal fre- quency of reassessment is likely to depend on a num- ber of factors, including the type of surgical procedure, the adequacy of initial pain relief, the pres- ence of side effects, presence of comorbidities, and",

Reassessments might be per- formed less frequently for patients with more stable pain (eg, patients who have exhibited good pain con- trol without side effects after 24 hours of stable ther- apy). Pain reassessments might be useful at the time of nursing shift changes or with new caregivers to establish a baseline and promote continuity of care, although evidence showing that routine reassessment of pain at nursing shift changes is associated with improved clinical outcomes is not available.",

          "(cid:2) The panel recommends that clinicians offer multi- modal analgesia, or the use of a variety of analgesic medications and techniques combined with non- pharmacological interventions, for the treatment of postoperative pain in children and adults (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Multimodal analgesia, defined as the use of a variety of analgesic medication and techniques that target different mechanisms of action in the peripheral and/or central nervous system (which might also be combined with nonpharmacological interventions) might have ad- ditiveorsynergisticeffectsandmoreeffectivepainrelief compared with single-modality interventions. For example, clinicians might offer local anesthetic-based regional (peripheral and neuraxial) analgesic techniques in combination with systemic opioids and other analge- sics as part of a multimodal approach to perioperative pain. Because of the availability of effective nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies for postop- erative pain management, the panel suggests that clini- cians routinely incorporate around the clock nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies into multi- modal analgesia regimens. Systemic opioids might not be required in all patients. One study suggests that it shouldbeavoidedwhennotneeded,becauselimitedev- idence suggests that perioperative opioid therapy might be associated with increased likelihood of long-term opioid use, with its attendant risks.4",

          "of the introductions contain a single move: BESP1 only contains Move 1 whereas BESP3 and BESP8 only contain Move 3. None of them follow a strict M1\u2013M2\u2013M3 sequence. The only sequence that is repeated is M1\u2013M3, which occurs four times. In summary, RAIs in The ESPecialist do not seem to follow a pattern in the organization of their rhetorical moves although there seems to be a preference for the M1\u2013M3 type. In this type of structural organization, the authors establish a territory (by making topic generalizations and giving background information, for example) and then present their current study (by announcing the present research and indicating the structure of the article, for example). The ESPj RAIs, on the other hand, follow the pattern proposed by the CARS model more closely. Three of them follow the M1\u2013M2\u2013M3 sequence strictly while five others (i.e., ESPj3, ESPj5, ESPj7, ESPj8 and ESPj9) contain this sequence plus a repetition of one or more moves. Among these, ESPj5, ESPj7 and ESPj8 show very little variation from the canonical sequence: ESPj5 contains a one-sentence Move 1 between a 7-sentence Move 2 and a 7-sentence Move 3 while ESPj7 and ESPj8 each contain two instances of Move 2, establishing the niche in two separate installments. With the exception of ESPj2, all the RAIs in this corpus contain a Move 2, and there was only one instance (i.e., ESPj1) of Move 3-fronting. ESPj1 did not contain a Move 1 either, being, overall, the introduction that was the most dissimilar from the model.",

          "The findings reported above seem to suggest that there are important differences in the rhetorical organi- zation of introductions in Brazilian Portuguese articles from The ESPecialist and articles from English for Specific Purposes. While the latter fits the proposed moves in the CARS model closely, the former has been shown to vary from it somewhat. It is worth noting that both journals specialize in the same subfield of Applied Linguistics, a claim supported not only by the names of these journals, but also by the similar editorial policies they hold (see Appendix C). Even though English for Specific Purposes reaches a wider inter- national readership by being published in English, the current academic lingua franca (Duszak & Lewkowicz, 2008), both journals started publication in the same year and can, therefore, be considered to have a similar level of maturity and tradition, at least in the eyes of the audience they reach. In this sense, the distinction made by Samraj (2005) between established fields and emerging fields of inquiry would not help explain the differences between the two sets of introductions analyzed in this study. It seems, thus, that the differences found would have to be attributed to cross-linguistic/cross-cultural reasons. The most striking difference between the BESP and the ESPj RAIs lies in the pervasive absence of Move 2 in the former. Other studies that looked at RAIs in languages other than English have found a similar pattern. As mentioned above, Jogthong (2001) reported an absence of Move 2 in 45% of the Thai articles studied while in Ahmad\u2019s (1997) corpus of Malay RAIs 35% lacked a Move 2. In the present study, 70% of the RAIs in Portuguese did not contain this move, while only 10% of those in English lacked it.",

          "In this paper, we describe a novel feature space designed to effectively classify the polarity and strength of relationships extracted from biomedical abstracts. In addition to the conventional syntactic features such as unigrams and bigrams, we have also explored and constructed semantics-based sequential features. These features are constructed at three different levels: entity, phrase, and sentence. A wrapper-based method is then used to select the optimal feature sets for both polarity and strength prediction. Specifically, a multi-stage SVM classifier and an SVR predictor are built for polarity and strength prediction, respectively. Two different schemas, namely, (1 vs. all) and (2 vs. 2), are employed to build the multi-stage SVM. Finally, three different kernel functions are considered at different stage of this SVM classifier. Our intensive evaluations have shown that for polarity prediction, the (2 vs. 2) schema in general works better than the (1 vs. all). It produces the highest polarity accuracy of 0.91 when both unigrams and semantics-based sequential structures (KSS) are used, with a standard error ranging between 0.01~0.02. On the other hand, we find that for strength prediction, unigrams solely can produce satisfying results. We obtain a high accuracy of 0.96, with the standard error ranging between 0.61%~0.63% for the strength analysis. We are currently expanding our annotated corpus to facilitate further validation of the findings reported in this work. We are also integrating this module with other modules as shown in Figure 1 towards building a quantitative food-disease-gene network. Finally, we are creating an interactive user interface to visually present this network.",

These techniques generally rely on a deep parse results that gives a rich representation which is used for applications in knowledge extraction and semantics. The problem with biomedical data parsing is that there is no exhaustive tagged training corpus available to build models for efficient parsing on test data. Also, deep parsing is computationally very expensive compared to shallow parsing that uses the finite state automaton techniques. UMLS graciously provides such a shallow parser[7] that is trained on entire Medline corpus and claims to achieve over 97% accuracy.",

          "Clear water repellents, silicone and acrylic coatings are among the solutions often sug- gested for preventing efflorescence. A coating may prevent efflorescence from recurring by reducing the amount of water absorbed by an exposed masonry surface. However, applying a coating to brickwork that has a tendency to effloresce, without stopping the mechanisms causing that efflorescence, may lead to deg- radation of the masonry. Further, applying a coating that inhibits evaporation of water from the masonry may also lead to degradation.",

          "As water and dissolved salts within masonry travel toward a coated exterior surface, they may be stopped at the inner margin of the coating (usually 1/ 8 to 1/ 4 in. [3 to 6 mm] below the surface). At this point, the water will evapo- rate, passing through the treated area as vapor and soluble salts in the water will be deposited within the mason- ry. Known as cryptoflorescnece or subflorescence, salts that crystallize within masonry can develop tremendous pressures which may result in brick spalling. For this reason, coatings are not recommended as the sole treatment for efflorescence problems.",

        "6. Identify the efflorescence. Knowing the composition of efflorescing salts is sometimes of use. Table 1, taken from Brownell\u2019s report lists the most probable sources of efflorescing salts. Commercial testing laboratories can use X-ray diffraction, petrographic analysis or chemical analysis can, in some instances, determine both the type of salts present and their relative quantity. 7. Consider miscellaneous sources of water when all obvious sources have been eliminated. Some of these sources are: condensation within the wall, poorly directed landscape sprinklers, leaky pipes, faulty drains and condensation on heating or plumbing pipes. If necessary, condensation analysis methods are described in Technical Note 47.",

        "When the mechanisms causing the efflorescing salts to appear have been established and the sources of salts or moisture are identified (usually the latter), suitable corrections must be addressed. Solutions to efflorescence prob- lems usually involve reducing water penetration into the masonry and removing the efflorescence from the wall. Recommendations for the correction of water penetration in masonry walls are contained in Technical Note 46."

We look for related phrases with uniquely mapping concepts and then build a suffix tree for the concept hierarchy compute the conceptual distance [10] between the possible phrase concepts and the unique concept. The shortest distance between two concepts is computed by a spreading activation search on the UMLS hierarchy graph. Two concepts share a common concept in the graph.

A list of all UMLS string representations for each of 45 codes (including synonyms from source vocabularies other than ICD-9-CM) was created as described in the MTI section above. The strings were then con- verted to lower case, punctuation was removed, and strings containing terms unlikely to be found in a clinical report were pruned. For example, Ab- domen NOS pain and Abdominal pain (finding) were reduced to abdominal pain. For the same rea- sons, some of the strings were relaxed into pat- terns. For example, it is unlikely to see PAIN CHEST in a chart, but very likely to find pain in chest. The string, therefore, was relaxed to the fol- lowing pattern: pain.*chest. The text of the clinical history and the impression fields of the radiology reports with negated expressions removed (see Section 2.2) was broken up into sentences. Each sentence was then searched for all available pat- terns. A corresponding code was assigned to the document for each matched pattern. This pattern matching achieved F-score = 0.79 on the training set. To reduce the number of codes assigned to a document, a check for allowed combinations was added as a post-processing step. The combination of assigned codes was looked up in the table of allowed codes. If not present, the codes were re- duced to the combination of assigned codes most frequently occurring in the training set. This brought the F-score up to 0.84 on the training data. As the performance of this classifier was compara- ble to other methods, we decided to include these results when combining the predictions of the other classifiers.",

For example, Ab- domen NOS pain and Abdominal pain (finding) were reduced to abdominal pain. For the same rea- sons, some of the strings were relaxed into pat- terns. For example, it is unlikely to see PAIN CHEST in a chart, but very likely to find pain in chest. The string, therefore, was relaxed to the fol- lowing pattern: pain.*chest. The text of the clinical history and the impression fields of the radiology reports with negated expressions removed (see Section 2.2) was broken up into sentences. Each sentence was then searched for all available pat- terns. A corresponding code was assigned to the document for each matched pattern. This pattern matching achieved F-score = 0.79 on the training set. To reduce the number of codes assigned to a document, a check for allowed combinations was added as a post-processing step. The combination of assigned codes was looked up in the table of allowed codes. If not present, the codes were re- duced to the combination of assigned codes most frequently occurring in the training set. This brought the F-score up to 0.84 on the training data. As the performance of this classifier was compara- ble to other methods, we decided to include these results when combining the predictions of the other classifiers.",

Note that all the results are generated using a linear kernel based SVR. From Table 11 we observe that all the feature combinations deliver approximately similar high-quality results. In other words, the addition of bigrams and semantics-based structural features does not improve the overall performance. This indicates that using unigrams alone is sufficient for the strength prediction task. The main reason behind this phenomenon is that unlike polarity of a relationship, the strength of a relationship is often directly associated with the specific words used in the relationship- depicting phrase. For instance, the sentence \u201cSoy consumption significantly reduces the risk of cancer.\u201d has a strong strength. The word \u201csignificantly\u201d carries the most weight for the SVR model to make the correct prediction. This also explains why the addition of other semantics based features does not help in general. Another observation we have made is that the linear kernel constantly outperforms the other kernels.

          "There are debates about whether the returns generated from the sales of medicines, including cancer medicines, are sufficient for pharmaceutical companies to cover their past R&D expenses, maintain their operations and engage in future drug discovery research. For example, some commentators have observed that the revenue generated from the sales of imatinib had exceeded the costs of R&D within two years and \u201cthe revenues over the subsequent years of the patent would represent generous profits to the company\u201d (30). Another study found that total revenue from the sales of 10 cancer medicines since approval over a median of four years (US$ 67.0 billion) was 9.3 times the total R&D spending of US$ 7.2 billion (or 7.4 times using an estimated risk-adjusted R&D costs of US$ 9.1 billion) (94).",

          "A further example is the pricing of sofosbuvir (Sovaldi) \u2013 a medicine used for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection, potentially preventing future cases of liver cancer. Fig. 3.3 (p.23) shows the timeline of price planning for Sovaldi based on information presented in the report by the Committee on Finance of the United States Senate (100). In this case, it shows the evolution of the expected price of Sovaldi from prior to its acquisition (<US$ 50 000 per course) to the final launch price of US$ 84 000 per course. The final price was decided based on an anticipated rise in revenue even though the manufacturer expected the number of patients receiving the medicine would decline (p.43) (100), and various stakeholders would react negatively to the firm\u2019s final pricing of the product. Furthermore, the manufacturer set a high price for Sovaldi with a view to consolidate the market\u2019s price expectation in preparation for setting an even higher price for a combination product that contains sofosbuvir (Harvoni) that would be launched after Sovaldi. It also included an arbitrary price increase from US$ 27 000 per bottle to US$ 28 000 per bottle (i.e. 3.7% increase) because it would \u201cbe easy from the press release, from 28 days and $28,000\u201d (p.57) (100). This example demonstrates that pricing solely according to commercial goals will impair a health system\u2019s ability to achieve public health goals because high prices limit patient access, thereby limiting the full value potential of the innovation.",

          "For newer targeted cancer medicines, there are two additional areas of uncertainty. Firstly, despite their established mechanisms of action, targeted cancer medicines may not have clinically-meaningful activities against all tumours with a matching genetic mutation. To this point, a clinical trial has found that the progression-free survival of patients with metastatic solid tumour refractory to standard of care did not improve with the use of targeted therapies that matched with the tumour\u2019s molecular profile but outside their approved indications, compared to patients who received treatment at the choice of their treating physicians (79). This means that targeted therapies should only be used according to approved indications and not based on identified molecular alternations or the general type of cancer.",

          "Secondly, a major limitation of targeted cancer medicines is the occurrence of treatment resistance which can result in a lack of response (termed intrinsic resistance) or partial or loss of responses over time (termed acquired resistance) (80). Clinically, this means that patients may experience prolonged progression- free survival, but not improved overall survival. While researchers continue to unravel the complex mechanisms of and mitigation strategies for treatment resistance, it is important to recognize that the use of single targeted therapies may not have durable treatment effects in clinical practice. Furthermore, while the use of targeted therapies in combination may in theory mitigate the emergence of treatment resistance (81), safety consideration either preclude the use of such combination, or compromise the doses at which individual agents could be used in combination, which might in turn lower its efficacy (82). Outcomes observed in clinical trials may not translate into benefits for patients in clinical practice",

If the main function of a RA is to transfer a new knowledge on a research topic, then a good paper is the one that is clear, coherent, focused, well argued and uses language that does not have ambiguous or equivoque meaning. However, it is not only the message that is important. The RA must have a well-defined structure and function in serve like a cook-book, so the others can reproduce and repeat explained experiments. Answer research questions Give summary conclusions There are some rules that can make the writing and publishing of RAs 'easier'. Here, we summarised some 'golden' rules that should always be in the mind of an inexperienced researcher (Table 3). We put all these together to make a final list of some 40 logical steps, which can be find in the Appendix.",

          "Although, it was assumed that the 'thicker' articles with wider range of vocabulary is preferable in the editors hands, the editors (and probably the readers) prefer simple, clear and coherent writing, rather than a fancy or complex, pseudo-scientific style. Also Funkhouser and Maccoby (1971) showed that the information gain is especially enhanced by the \u201cuse of examples\", i.e. it helps a lot to use some non-science material, such as everyday life parallels, historical points, etc. On the other hand, some sections, such as Introduction and Discussion, have to intrigue readers and attract interest and should therefore not be over-simplified. For example, a mysterious title can catch readers' attention and will be easily remembered (e.g.: T.Y. Li and J. Yorke named their famous paper on chaos: \"The period three means chaos\"). Some sections require more skill and are more important. It is approximated that from all published journal RAs in the world, only less than 5% are read in detail. However, more than 50% of abstracts are read and so the quality of an abstracts is much more important (Gordon, 1983). Therefore, the abstract should present the 'story' of the RA in miniature and should be readable standalone.",

        "What is the purpose of a RA and what makes it a good one, and who decides that it is a good RA? Are there rules for easier writing? If the main function of a RA is to transfer a new knowledge on a research topic, then a good paper is the one that is clear, coherent, focused, well argued and uses language that does not have ambiguous or equivoque meaning. However, it is not only the message that is important. The RA must have a well-defined structure and function in serve like a cook-book, so the others can reproduce and repeat explained experiments. Answer research questions Give summary conclusions There are some rules that can make the writing and publishing of RAs 'easier'. Here, we summarised some 'golden' rules that should always be in the mind of an inexperienced researcher (Table 3). We put all these together to make a final list of some 40 logical steps, which can be find in the Appendix."

          "The use of personal data is critical to ensure quality and reliability in scientific research. The new Regulation [European Union (EU)] 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data [general data protection regulation (GDPR)], repealing Directive 95/46/EC, strengthens and harmonises the rules for protecting individuals\u2019 privacy rights and freedoms within and, under certain conditions, outside the EU territory. This new and historic legal milestone both prolongs and updates the EU acquis of the previous Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC. The GDPR fixes both general rules applying to any kind of personal data processing and specific rules applying to the processing of special categories of personal data such as health data taking place in the context of scientific research, this including clinical and translational research areas. This article aims to provide an overview of the new rules to consider where scientific projects include the processing of personal health data, genetic data or biometric data and other kinds of sensitive information whose use is strictly regulated by the GDPR in order to give the main key facts to researchers to adapt their practices and ensure compliance to the EU law to be enforced in May 2018.",

One main reason we believe is that the annotated corpus has a large number of positive examples as shown in Table 4. We also observe that the \u201cno-relationship\u201d has a constantly high accuracy and is not influenced by other feature combinations. The reason behind this is that the unigrams found in the relationships that have \u201cno relationship\u201d polarity often contain unique negation terms such as \u201cno\u201d and \u2018not\u201d.

Known robot activity (software robots downloading all free material for indexing purposes, e.g., Google) was removed from the data set before analysis to arrive at a more accurate estimate of human activity. Citation figures were gathered monthly from the Web of Science (http://www.isiknowledge.com) for the first 3 yr after article publication. While journals control the primary access route to articles, it is common in some disciplines and at some institutions for authors to self-archive some version of their articles on public websites or in digital repositories. To obtain an estimate of the extent and effects of self-archiving, we wrote a Perl script to search for PDF copies of articles anywhere on the Internet (ignoring the publisher\u2019s website) 1 yr after publication. We attempted to identify as many instances of self-archiving as possible, while minimizing the number of false positives.",

Continuous variables (page length, number of authors, and number of citations) were log transformed to adhere to the assumption of normality re- quired for linear regression.

While adding 1 shifts the citation distribution to the right, we were interested primarily in the slopes of the regression lines and not their intercepts. To interpret the results of the regression equation, estimates of log-transformed variables were exponentiated in order to arrive at their multiplicative effect (ME). For exam- ple, if the logCitation estimate were 0.5, the ME of this estimate would be e0.5 or 1.65, representing a 65% increase in citations.",

Citation figures were gathered monthly from the Web of Science (http://www.isiknowledge.com) for the first 3 yr after article publication. While journals control the primary access route to articles, it is common in some disciplines and at some institutions for authors to self-archive some version of their articles on public websites or in digital repositories. To obtain an estimate of the extent and effects of self-archiving, we wrote a Perl script to search for PDF copies of articles anywhere on the Internet (ignoring the publisher\u2019s website) 1 yr after publication. We attempted to identify as many instances of self-archiving as possible, while minimizing the number of false positives.",

          "Medical tourism is becoming a source of economic gain for many countries and regions of the world. (Carruth and Carruth 2010; Hill n.d.; Kahn 2010) Medical tourism increases the economic situation (Munro 2012; Pocock and Phua 2011) in a destination country, provides care for many individuals willing to pay out of pocket, and lowers health insurance costs for U.S. employers and health insurers willing to pay for health care abroad. It is difficult to determine, with any accuracy, the number of persons travelling from the U.S alone to a foreign country for health care reasons. Estimates of Americans travelling abroad for treatments place the number of persons traveling to India or Thailand for health care reasons in excess of 750,000 persons for 2005 (Herrick 2007; Kahn 2010). A 2003 estimate placed the total number of persons traveling to India, Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia at 1.4 million persons (Heung, Kucukusta, and Song 2011). This estimate increased in 2010 to 6 million persons, with an economic gain of > $4 billion, with half of the revenue going to India (Heung, Kucukusta, and Song 2011; Horowitz, Rosensweig, and Jones 2007; Hill n.d.). As medical tourism develops into a multi-billion dollar industry, with steady annual growth projected, estimates of global economic gains vary between $40 and $100 billion for destination countries (Zwelling 2011; Herrick 2007).",

          "While the increase of health care treatments and procedures performed abroad involves many elective procedures (Woodman 2010; Synder, Dharamsi and Crooks 2011, Milstein and Smith 2007), which many U.S. health insurers deny payment, there is a growing interest by U.S. health care insurers to pay for more expensive complex procedures, such as Coronary Arterial Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery. Coronary bypass surgery, one of the most common cardiac surgical procedures performed, serves as a \u201ccash cow\u201d for many U.S. hospitals (Crowley 2010). Because cardiac surgery procedures provide high revenue, smaller local hospitals can market as offering a high-profile program in cardiac care even if the hospital has a low volume of bypass cases, thereby increasing patient volume and revenue (Regenbogen, Gust, Birkmeyer 2012). Focusing on coronary bypass, a review of Medicare data (1992 \u2013 2003) demonstrates a decline in coronary bypass surgical procedures from 1992 to 2003, while the number of hospitals performing these surgeries steadily increased (Wilson, et al. 2007). Using Nationwide Inpatient Sample data (2001 \u2013 2008), a study by Epstein et al (2011) supports Wilson\u2019s et al review, demonstrating a decrease in the number of coronary bypass surgeries per hospital, yet a 12% increase in the number of hospitals during this period. In an effort to lure Americans to seek care abroad, coronary bypass procedures have become one of several expensive health care procedures offered by larger health care facilities in India, Singapore, and Thailand. This paper focuses on examining the growing interest of U.S. individuals, employers, and health insurance providers for having coronary bypass performed in India, Thailand, or Singapore.",

Table 1 illustrates the cost comparison of coronary bypass surgery in the U.S. with India, Thailand, and Singapore; these cost comparison figures are promoted throughout the medical tourism industry. A comparison study of costs for coronary bypass surgery in two large hospitals in India, one in Thailand, and the overall California Insurer average cost payment, demonstrates the costs in India and Thailand did not exceed $15,000 while the California Insurer average (private insurance) exceeded $50,000 (Milstein and Smith 2007)",

Severe resource constraints, the poor condition of roads or trails, and a lack of fuel may dictate the utilization of a wider range of options. In the United Republic of Tanzania, for example, modes of emergency transportation include motor- boats, canoes, bicycles with trailers, tricycles with platforms, tractors with trailers, reconditioned vehicles, and ox carts (22).",

          "of the weakest links in the system. A study in Malawi revealed that the condition of many seriously ill children arriving at clinicshadnotpreviouslybeenrecognized.Insteadofreceiving immediate emergency care they were kept waiting for long periods before being given proper treatment. This resulted in avoidable deaths and disability (28). In Mexico, verbal autopsies of 132 children who died revealed that the majority had been seen by a physician within three days of death. Poor selection of medications and late referral to tertiary care were judged to be important contributory factors in more than half the deaths (29). A qualitative study of 21 hospitals in seven developing countries found that poor triage of incoming patients and inadequate provision of emergency care jeopar- dized the lives of arriving patients (30). Fourteen of the facilities (including 10 of 13 district hospitals) did not have an adequate triage system. A comprehensive review of the management of 131 children treated at these facilities found evidenceofinappropriateordelayedtriagein8%ofcases,poor clinical assessments in 41%, and potentially harmful delays in treatment in 19%. Several international health projects aimed at improving initial triage and treatment have been instituted at district health care facilities. Most focus on the strengthening of maternal and child health. One such project produced guidelines for emergency triage and treatment (28). An evaluation of these guidelines demonstrated that they significantly decreased the time required to assess children in need of urgent medical attention (31). In Sierra Leone a health care facility was upgraded in order to enhance its ability to provide prompt medical and surgicaltreatmenttowomenwithcomplicationsofpregnancy.

          "Throughout the history of medicine, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has played a significant role in the treatment of cancer patients. In 1999, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) created the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) in recognition of this growing field. Research funding to the NCCAM has risen from $ 2 million in 1992 to $50 million by 2000 and is expected to be more than $110 million by the mid-2000\u2019s [1]. A survey conducted in 2005 indicated that approximately 35.9% of cancer patients attempted use of CAM during their treatment course [2]. In fact, that percentage may be even higher as studies have shown that many patients do not disclose the use of CAM therapy unless asked specifically [3]. Physicians poorly communicate with their patients regarding the potential benefits or harms of CAM because they have minimal understanding of CAM therapy and its physiological role in managing diseases [4,5]. Patients are often dissatisfied with their physicians\u2019 lack of knowledge regarding CAM therapy [6]. Patients who have a history of incorporating CAM into their management plan are generally driven by personal beliefs and principles regarding life and health [7]. An increased use of CAM has been seen in patients with increased psychosocial stress or poor prognosis at initial diagnosis [8,9]. Additionally, females and younger patients have a higher predilection for using CAM therapy [10]. There are numerous modalities of CAM such as spiritual healing or prayer, herbal medicine, and chiropractics [11]. This review focuses on medicinal therapies used as CAM for patients suffering from malignancy, specifically lung cancer.",

          "CAM specific to lung cancer has focused on therapeutic options that may have less systemic toxicity compared to current chemotherapy options such as Gemcitabine, Paclitaxel, and Etoposide. Herbal plants that have been used in lung cancer therapy include Platycodon grandiflorum (Campanulaceae), Morus alba (Moraceae), Prunus armeniaca (Rosaceae), Rhus verniciflua (Anacardiaceae), Perilla frutescens (Labiatae), Stemona japonica (Stemonaceae), Tusilago farfara (Compositae), and Draba nemorosa (Brassicaceae) [12]. Although these are used as alternative modes of therapy, it is more common for herbal remedies to be used as adjuvant modalities with chemotherapy [13]. The role of these herbal therapies is multifactorial. They can be used to reduce chemotherapy-induced toxicity, mitigate cancer-related symptoms, or directly increase anti- cancer effects [14]. A randomized control trial (RCT) of 61 patients evaluated the use of herbal medications as adjuvant therapy and showed an enhancement in median survival in the group that was treated with Sheng-mai and Gu- jin Granule along with Navelbine and Cisplatin [15]. This group had a 48.5% increase in survival compared to 32.2% in the control arm that only received the two chemotherapy drugs. Another study enrolled 232 non-small cell lung cancer patients and showed that Shenqi-fuzheng, an herbal injection similar to Sheng- mai, served as a useful adjuvant to chemotherapy by improving quality of life [16]. Similarly another RCT of 121 patients with advanced non- small cell lung cancer showed improved quality of life and a trend towards increase in survival time in patients assigned to Kangliuzengxiao and Feiyanning in addition to chemotherapy [17]. Fiji Recipe therapy has been shown to alleviate chemotherapy side effects and enhance therapeutic efficacy [18]. Similarly, other studies have demonstrated the benefits of CAM therapy in mitigating the adverse effects of chemotherapy, including myalgia and diarrhea [19,20]. A case report showed regression of small cell lung cancer with the use of Chinese herbal medicines [21]. Lastly, another case report",

The lack of resources (plants) to produce these herbal remedies could result in inadequate supply for the potentially high demand. The technology required for plant extraction and mixture preparation is another hurdle in establishing an adequate supply. Another obstacle is the lack of"

Although many of the positive feature are sensi- ble and similar to those found in the ranking experiments and previous research (Wallace, Paul, and Elhadad 2015; Zhang et al. 2016), we find that the negative features are dominated by alzheimers and dementia related terms in the title and abstract. These results are indicative of an oddity in the dataset provided by Altmetric, specifically the web- site Alzforum. Alzforum is an information resource web- site for alzheimers researchers and is one of the websites included in Altmetric\u2019s news crawl. Most of the Alzforum articles tracked by Altmetric post only article metadata, and the website was marked as a non-news source due to its super high rate of publication. Before sampling, Alzforum covers 8,347 of the 34,329 scientific articles with no real coverage and is the highest frequency outlet on that subset. However, it covers only 667 of the 57,668 scientific articles with real coverage. Of 8,436 matched pairs, Alzforum cov- ers 1,380 negative and 224 positive samples. Although we control for subjects, they are typically more general, such as \u201cneuroscience,\u201d \u201cpsychology and cognitive sciences,\u201d and \u201cgeriatrics and gerontology.\u201d Thus, we are unable to control for specific topics, such as alzheimers, and logistic regres- sion learns that most alzheimers articles are unpopular.",

Dr. Arag\u00f3n understands and respects the importance of religion to the spiritual well-being and mental health of many, and accordingly has encouraged San Franciscans to continue to practice their religious faith in all ways that are safe. It is for this reason that the Health Officer issued a revised health order on June 11, 2020 (Order of the Health Officer No. C19-07e, the \u201cHealth Order\u201d), which allows for in-person outdoor services conducted according to science-based safeguards that will minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission.",

These large gatherings of people indoors for a long period, in some instances reported without face coverings and with singing, place clergy, staff, volunteers and congregants alike at heightened risk of transmission of COVID-19, which can lead to serious illness and even death, and endangers the health of the Archdiocese\u2019s parishioners and the entire community.

          "Governments and insurers have also implemented non-price policies to ensure efficiency. For example, some countries require treating clinicians to obtain approval prior to prescribing or dispensing a select set of medicines, a practice known as prior authorization (216\u2013218). Medicines may be selected based on criteria such as evidence-based guidelines, contractual agreements and costs. An important consideration for implementing prior authorization is to strike a balance between the level of administrative tasks to support such policies and timely patient access to treatment. For example, a process review in a breast oncology practice in the USA found that prior authorization was \u201ccomplicated and labour intensive\u201d, and had limited impact on utilization because only 2.5% of prescriptions Non-price policies could promote efficiency",

          "Journalists act as gatekeepers to the scientific world, control- ling what information reaches the public eye and how it is presented. Analyzing the kinds of research that typically re- ceive more media attention is vital to understanding issues such as the \u201cscience of science communication\u201d (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2017), patterns of misinformation, and the \u201ccycle of hype.\u201d We track the coverage of 91,997 scientific articles published in 2016 across various disciplines, publishers, and news outlets us- ing metadata and text data from a leading tracker of sci- entific coverage in social and traditional media, Altmetric. We approach the problem as one of ranking each day\u2019s, or week\u2019s, papers by their likely level of media attention, us- ing the learning-to-rank model lambdaMART (Burges 2010). We find that ngram features from the title, abstract and press release significantly improve performance over the metadata features journal, publisher, and subjects.",

          "News media are an important source of scientific informa- tion for the public in domains such as health, medicine, and climate change research, making the accurate communica- tion of findings \u2013 and patterns of misinformation \u2013 a vi- tal issue for society and public policy (Geller, Bernhardt, and Holtzman 2002; Boykoff and Boykoff 2004; Brechman, Lee, and Cappella 2009). A substantial amount of scholarly attention has been devoted to studying the mechanisms by which academic research findings move along and through a chain of translation-oriented intermediaries, from journals anduniversitycommunicationsofficestoreportersandblog- gers and finally to citizen groups and individual members of the public. Journalists\u2019 internal processes of selection and framing news are very significant, as they are an antecedent and structural factor that affects all subsequent issues of public attention. Because parsing and interpreting the methods and results of highly technical scientific papers is a difficult task, journalists may use simple heuristics to determine whether research is novel and of high quality and impact, such as inspecting the name of the journal and the article subjects. An even simpler explanation is that journalists may publish Copyright c (cid:13) 2018, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.",

          "on a subset of the press releases they read each day, either found on a press release aggregation website such as Eu- rekAlert! or Science Daily or sent to them by media offices. Discovering what sort of content journalists believe is sig- nificant and likely to be popular provides insight into how journalists judge the newsworthiness of different content, uncovering their biases and preferences, and helps shed light on high-profile issues being actively debated relating to the \u201cscience of science communication\u201d (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2017). Scholars who have studied the decision-making of jour- nalists in terms of story selection and framing have exam- ined various factors, from institutional and economic incen- tives to a need for social validation (Donsbach 2004). In the realm of science, practices such as embargoing of scholarly findings and the attendant effects on communication have been examined, suggesting that certain science communica- tions and public relations strategies can influence news cov- erage (Kiernan 2003b). Research has suggested that jour- nalists seldom choose to report on scientific studies outside of the domains of health and medicine (Suleski and Ibaraki 2009). Issues of hype and errors of framing and omission have long plagued various forms of news media and science communication, with the cycle of hype sometimes begin- ning with researchers themselves using exaggerated terms such as \u201cbreakthrough\u201d in press materials and public an- nouncements (Bubela et al. 2009). News reporting may then replicate the exaggerations found in such communi- cations materials (Sumner et al. 2014). Further, news sto- ries, particularly those produced by elite outlets, may influ- ence the prestige of, and citations to, scientific research, fu- eling a hype cycle that is increasingly coming under scrutiny in the research and media communities (Kiernan 2003a; Caulfield et al. 2016).",

The MDH-PHL currently tests all CRAB isolates received through sentinel surveillance for OXA-23, OXA-24, and OXA-58, along with five other carbapenemase genes (KPC, NDM, OXA-48, IMP, and VIM). Approximately 20% of the CRAB isolates tested from Minnesota facilities are carbapenemase-producing (CP), with the majority producing OXA-23 or OXA-24. Rapid identification of CP-CRAB and immediate implementation of infection control measures are key to controlling transmission in health care facilities.",

They found that those receiving opioids had a higher rate of surgery and that, overall, there was no significant difference four years later. Opioid medications were associated with an increased crossover to surgical treatment. Four years after the initiation of treatment, 16 percent of those who received opioids at the start were still on opioids, whereas only 5 percent of those who were treated with non-opioids initially were on opioids after four years. They concluded that those who were initially treated with opioids had a higher rate of surgery and a greater chance of being on opioids four years later but no significant change in overall outcome (Radcliff et al., 2013).",

Costs of treatment over 1 year were calculated for all patients, regardless of whether they were treated, and included the unit costs of treatment, relapse costs and average monthly follow-up costs.

The estimated cost per patient in Italy was \u20ac 6600, which is higher than the value estimated in the Fourcade publication [ 14 ] .

It should be noted when interpreting this data that use of PSA testing for prostate cancer is more widespread in the USA than in many other countries, thus increasing the number of cases identifi ed. In addition, Medicare did not cover certain cancer care expenses such as oral medicines, commonly used to treat prostate cancer until January 2006. These out-of-pocket costs may comprise 10% of the $11 000 estimate.

          "A temporary grade of Incomplete (I) may be given if a student\u2019s work has been satisfactory throughout the term but, due to extenuating circumstances, the student needs additional time to complete the remaining assignments. In this context, extenuating circumstances include non-academic factors beyond the student\u2019s control that make it impossible to continue: severe illness, death in the immediate family, drastic change in work or financial situation, or other unusual and extreme situations as deemed appropriate by the instructor. It is the student\u2019s responsibility to request the incomplete grade in writing prior to the close of the academic term. If the instructor grants the request, the instructor and student must promptly complete, sign, and submit the Incomplete Grade Contract to the Education Office. The contract specifies (1) all assignments yet to be completed, (2) the date(s) by which the remaining work is to be submitted to the instructor, and (3) the default grade if the student received no points for missing work. Incomplete grades must be resolved by the agreed-upon time in the contract, which should be no later than that last day of next regular academic term. If the work is not completed by that time, the default grade listed on the form will become the final grade, or an F if no grade is indicated. Only the rarest of situations will warrant additional extensions, and they require the expressed approval of the department chair.",

Normalmente, os \u00f3culos n\u00e3o produzem vis\u00e3o com qualidade, sendo que a maioria dos pacientes utilizam lentes de contato. Casos avan\u00e7ados da doen\u00e7a, geralmente quando as formas de tratamento anteriores n\u00e3o s\u00e3o mais suficientes, podem necessitar de trans- plante de c\u00f3rnea (troca da c\u00f3rnea doente por uma c\u00f3rnea doada). Desde 1996, o Anel de Ferrara vem sendo utilizado com o objetivo de aplanar e regularizar a c\u00f3rnea, na tentativa de melhorar a qualidade visual. J\u00e1 \u00e9 considerado procedimento aprovado pelo CFM (Conselho Federal de Me- dicina). Neste procedimento, a anestesia \u00e9 t\u00f3pica (com col\u00edrio). Ap\u00f3s, \u00e9 realizado um pequeno corte na c\u00f3rnea, em torno de 1mm, por onde s\u00e3o implantados os an\u00e9is intracorneanos (1 ou 2). Os an\u00e9is s\u00e3o feitos de acr\u00edlico (polimetilmetacrilato) e s\u00e3o introduzidos no interior da c\u00f3rnea. \u00c9 uma t\u00e9cnica revers\u00edvel (os an\u00e9is podem ser removidos se produzirem algum efeito indesejado). Na grande maioria dos casos, o procedimento cir\u00fargico \u00e9 realizado em um per\u00edodo de 15 (quin- ze) a 30 (trinta) minutos. A recupera\u00e7\u00e3o visual \u00e9 gradual, ocorrendo de maneira mais significativa na primeira semana, mas pode levar at\u00e9 meses de estabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o. O procedimento a laser em geral, \u00e9 mais r\u00e1pido e os t\u00faneis para implante do anel s\u00e3o confeccio- nados de maneira mais precisa. A prescri\u00e7\u00e3o dos \u00f3culos, ou lentes de contato pode ser necess\u00e1ria para melhorar a vis\u00e3o ap\u00f3s o procedimento cir\u00fargico. 3. Benef\u00edcios do procedimento proposto: Com a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o do procedimento cir\u00fargico de implante do anel intracorneano pode ocorrer diminui\u00e7\u00e3o do grau de astigmatismo e melhora da vis\u00e3o. O resultado n\u00e3o \u00e9 garantido. O paciente pode necessitar de um transplante de c\u00f3rnea se o implante do anel intracorneano n\u00e3o trouxe os benef\u00edcios esperados.

          "Sleep-inducing drugs (hypnotics) are medications specif- ically designed to induce sleepiness directly after intake. Optimal agents affect cognitive performance during this period while inducing minimal sleepiness in the waking day after use. An optimal hypnotic would have low tox- icity and addictive potential, as well a minimal side effect profile (Oswald 1970). Among the first hypnotics, and an agent still in use is chloral hydrate - the original \u201cMickey Finn\u201d - slipped into the drinks of unsuspecting marks for the purposes of criminal activity. Unfortu- nately, this medication is difficult to use since the LD-50 (potentially fatal dose) is quite close to the therapeutic dose. In the years leading up to the 1970\u2019s, rapidly acting barbiturates were commonly utilized for their hypnotic effects. Unfortunately, these medications, also drugs of abuse, had a significant danger of overdose and contrib- uted to an era that was characterized in part by deaths due to overdoses of sleeping pills. These medications and similar barbiturate-like medications [Methaqualone (Quaalude, Sopor) Glutethimide (Doriden), Ethchlor- vynol (Placidyl), Methyprylon (Nodudar)] have limited availability and are rarely used due to limited efficacy, cognitive effects, the potential for abuse and lethal tox- icity associated with overdose (Oswald 1970). Today their primary therapeutic uses include executions and fa- cilitated euthanasia (Lossignol 2008). Most currently utilized hypnotics affect the widely dis- persed negative neurotransmitter GABA. In the 1970\u2019s benzodiazepines (GABA agonists) were first marketed as hypnotics. Some of these agents had an extremely short duration of action [Triazolam (Halcion)]. While this agent-induced minimal next day somnolence, use was as- sociated with daytime memory impairment, particularly at higher dosages (Roehrs et al. 2000; Adam and Oswald",

          "1989). In the 1990\u2019s newer agents were developed and marketed that had selective effects on GABA receptors in- cluding Zolpidem (Ambien), Zaleplon (Sonata), Eszopi- clone (Estorra) and Indiplon. While all hypnotics have abuse potential for individuals with addictive histories and personalities, these agents have been noted to have min- imal additive potential (Hajak et al. 2003). These agents are less likely to have deleterious side effects than most OTC treatments for insomnia, however, with increased use, more side effects including next effects on driving have been reported. This effect as well as next day re- bound insomnia has particularly been reported for higher doses of zolpidem (Verster et al. 2002). In many cases, MVA\u2019s occurred in the period of somnolence and cogni- tive impairment during the first few hours after ingestion. Comparatively normal results on psychomotor tests can be obtained 3.25 h. after zaleplon ingestion and 6.25 h. after zopiclone ingestion (Paul et al. 2003). While these agents have excellent efficacy with minimal side effects, at higher doses these agents can exhibit benzodiazepine-like effects. Idiosyncratic reactions of persistent daytime som- nolence and/or memory loss have been reported. Some patients will report next day sedation after the nighttime use of these agents, as well as demonstrate an increased error rate in driving tests (Verster et al. 2007). Such infor- mation was forthcoming only after these drugs became generic and widely utilized in clinical practice. Most sedat- ing drugs if adopted into such widespread use would also be at least as likely to demonstrate epidemiological effects on MVA\u2019s and MVA associated deaths. In the elderly, chronic use of sedating drugs (particularly those with anti-cholinergic side effects) can be associated with an increased risk for falls, and confusion (American Geriatrics Society 2015). Reported next day sleepiness and other side effects associated with hypnotic use are summarized in Table 3. The newer GABA-effective hypnotics are the only medications with demonstrated effectiveness in treating chronic insomnia (NIH State of the Science Conference",

          "somnolence as a side effect is reproducible in susceptible individuals (White and Rumbold 1988). Sedation is a com- mon side effect of the traditional antipsychotics, with chlorpromazine and thioridazine somewhat more sedating than haloperidol. Clinical studies have shown a high inci- dence of persistent sedation with clozapine (46%) with less frequent reports of sedation with risperidone, olanzapine, sertindole and quetiapine (Monti et al. 2016). The sed- ation associated with these agents is most likely associated with their known effects on histaminic receptors. Doxepin, a sedating psychotropic agent with pro- nounced histamine (H-1) receptor antagonism exerts at least part of its effects by antagonizing orexin (Krystal et al. 2013). Suvorexant, is an orexin antagonist designed to lower waking arousal (Norman and Anderson 2016). Currently, it is being heavily marketed as a hypnotic (Rhyne and Anderson 2015). As based on performance and driving tests, this agent is known to produce a dose-related next day increase in somnolence for all age groupings tested (Farkus 2013). Sedative drug effects on daytime sleepiness are summarized in Table 4.",

          "Clinically these agents are sometimes used off-label for their sedative effects. Among antihypertensives in wide use, the complaints of tiredness, fatigue and daytime sleepiness are commonly associated with drugs having antagonistic effects at the norepinephrine neuroreceptor (Dimsdale 1992). The complaints of tiredness, fatigue and daytime sleepiness (2\u20134.3%) associated with beta-blocker use may occur secondary to disturbed sleep or direct action of the drug. Beta-blocking drugs with vasodilating properties (e.g. carvedilol, labetalol) are also associated with reported fatigue and somnolence (3\u201311%). Sedation is among the most common side ef- fects reported for the alpha-2 agonists clonidine and methyldopa (30\u201375%) (AHFS 2003). Alpha-1 antagonists (e.g. terazosin, prazosin) are sometimes associated with transient sedation. Prazosin, a norepinephine antagonist, has demonstrated value in treating insomnia associated with PTSD nightmares (Raskind et al. 2003). Clonidine is sometimes utilized to treat the agitation and insomnia that result from using amphetamines to treat AD/HD in pediatric patients (Ming et al. 2011).",

Inter- estingly, \u201cprotein\u201d in the press release is of positive polar- ity on average, whereas it is negative when present in the abstract. We hypothesize that this may be because, on aver- age, very technical scientific papers, such as those mention- ing proteins and cells, are less accessible to journalists, but those which garner a press release are much more likely to be read and covered. Similar to Zhang et al. (2016) \u201c95\u201d (for 95% CI) is an important, positive feature, perhaps since this is commonly found in results of medical studies that may be of interest to the general public.",

However, although harder, this problem may be more realis- tic since, as noted in the introduction, many journalists start with press materials to inform what science they cover be- fore reading original articles. Table 6 displays the top 20 fea- tures for the daily experiment using all features. Important features for these experiments are similar to those listed for the experiments including all scientific articles, except fea- tures from the press release are more prevalent. This makes sense as press releases were issued for all articles in this sub- set (and we have the text of most of them), and press releases are an important source text for journalists.

          "Choosing a doctor to treat cancer is one of the most important decisions for newly diagnosed cancer patients. Typically, the doctor who made the preliminary diagnosis, usually the patient\u2019s primary care physician, will recommend appropriate cancer specialists. There are three main types of cancer physicians or oncologists, based on the type of treatment service they provide: medical (those who treat cancer using chemotherapy and other drugs), surgical, and radiation. Some types of oncologists focus on specific populations. For example, pediatric oncologists spe- cialize in the care of children, and hematologists specialize in patients with blood disorders. Some cancers, such as skin and prostate cancer, may be treated by doctors who specialize in specific body systems (i.e., dermatologists and urologists, respectively). Plastic surgeons may also be involved in cancer treatment by performing reconstructive surgeries as part of cancer care, particularly for patients with breast or head and neck cancers.",

          "Pain assessment involves more than just quantifying theintensityofpain.Highpainintensityratingsorbehav- ioralscalescoresthatdonotrespondtousualcareshould be investigated to determine whether the pain might be due to a new medical issue or surgical complication and the potential role of opioid tolerance and psychological distress. Assessment should determine what interven- tions have been effective for the pain, how the pain af- fects function, the type of pain (eg, neuropathic, visceral, somatic, muscle spasms), and whether there are barriers to effective pain management, such as cultural orlanguagedifferences,cognitivedeficits,orpatientmis- conceptions about pain management (Table 2). In addi- tion, it is not sufficient to assess pain only at rest. Pain that is relativelywell controlled at rest canbe severe dur- ing movement or with specific activities that cause increased pain (eg, swallowing after tonsillectomy), with important implications for symptom management and recovery. The panel suggests that clinicians assess pain at rest and with activities, as the latter is often more severe and difficult to control than pain at rest.110,270 Presence of pain with activity has important implications for use of additional interventions and discharge planning. For example, pain that is well controlled at rest but severe with movement can have major effects on a patient\u2019s ability to participate in postsurgical rehabilitation and return to normal function, and pain with swallowing after tonsillectomy could increase risk for dehydration. Assessments for other clinical issues such as sedation, delirium, and nausea or other side effects related to interventions are also important to help guide decisions regarding adjustmentofthe postoperativepain management plan. There is insufficient evidence to guide firm recom- mendations on optimal timing or frequency of patient reassessments in the postoperative setting. The timing of assessments after administration of an intervention should be informed by the time to achieve peak ef- fects, which is typically 15 to 30 minutes after paren- teral drug therapy or 1 to 2 hours after administration of an oral analgesic. With nonpharma- cologic interventions, pain relief often occurs during or immediately after their application. The optimal fre- quency of reassessment is likely to depend on a num- ber of factors, including the type of surgical procedure, the adequacy of initial pain relief, the pres- ence of side effects, presence of comorbidities, and",

          "changes in clinical status. Reassessments might be per- formed less frequently for patients with more stable pain (eg, patients who have exhibited good pain con- trol without side effects after 24 hours of stable ther- apy). Pain reassessments might be useful at the time of nursing shift changes or with new caregivers to establish a baseline and promote continuity of care, although evidence showing that routine reassessment of pain at nursing shift changes is associated with improved clinical outcomes is not available.",

          "(cid:2) The panel recommends that clinicians offer multi- modal analgesia, or the use of a variety of analgesic medications and techniques combined with non- pharmacological interventions, for the treatment of postoperative pain in children and adults (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Multimodal analgesia, defined as the use of a variety of analgesic medication and techniques that target different mechanisms of action in the peripheral and/or central nervous system (which might also be combined with nonpharmacological interventions) might have ad- ditiveorsynergisticeffectsandmoreeffectivepainrelief compared with single-modality interventions. For example, clinicians might offer local anesthetic-based regional (peripheral and neuraxial) analgesic techniques in combination with systemic opioids and other analge- sics as part of a multimodal approach to perioperative pain. Because of the availability of effective nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies for postop- erative pain management, the panel suggests that clini- cians routinely incorporate around the clock nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies into multi- modal analgesia regimens. Systemic opioids might not be required in all patients. One study suggests that it shouldbeavoidedwhennotneeded,becauselimitedev- idence suggests that perioperative opioid therapy might be associated with increased likelihood of long-term opioid use, with its attendant risks.4",

One difficulty with such an analysis is that new chemotypes have an inherently higher risk than additional members of established chemical classes, other than the risks of failure due to resistance (which are higher for drugs that have been used for many years). For this review\u2019s new analysis (Table 8), new chemotypes are separated from life-cycle management projects. The overall success rates have not changed significantly in the last 3 years, either for MMV or for the CMR benchmark, which is reassuring. The data shows that a new molecule in formal preclinical evaluation has an 8% chance of becoming part of a product.",

The hope on the horizon is that many of the new molecules are first-in-class, and so should they fail in clinical devel- opment there will be scope for well-defined back-up pro- jects, and these are normally much more cost-effective programmes. The definition of new molecular targets also opens up new possibilities for engaging the wider research community, allowing access to resources such as the EU\u2019s European Lead Factory, which considers molec- ular targets but not phenotypic approaches.",

One difficulty with such an analysis is that new chemotypes have an inherently higher risk than additional members of established chemical classes, other than the risks of failure due to resistance (which are higher for drugs that have been used for many years). For this review\u2019s new analysis (Table 8), new chemotypes are separated from life-cycle management projects. The overall success rates have not changed significantly in the last 3 years, either for MMV or for the CMR benchmark, which is reassuring. The data shows that a new molecule in formal preclinical evaluation has an 8% chance of becoming part of a product.",

How- ever, if one aims for a 90% overall chance of success (P), the number of candidates n, each with a success probabil- ity s (8%) is described by the negative binomial distribu- tion in Eq. 1."

Many parenteral chemotherapy products have distinctive colors, and prod- uct coloration should be confirmed before administration. At checkpoint 8, patients who self-administer their medications (or receive it from personal caregivers) should carefully read the container\u2019s label to confirm the product\u2019s identity and review its instructions for use (schedule of dos- ing, whether to take with or without food) each time they take a medication. At checkpoint 9, patients should be encouraged to ask questions about their treatment before its administration and compare its appearance and medication label with informa- tion they received about the treatment. Patient identification using two identifiers should occur prior to chemotherapy administration.

          "In the clinical laboratory, sleep is defined by its electro- encephalography (EEG) in concert with electromyog- raphy (EMG), electrooculography (EOG) and other telemetry. Using polysomnographic recordings, sleep can be classified into rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. The NREM sleep is further classified into 3 sleep stages namely Stage N1 sleep, Stage N2 sleep, and stage N3 sleep (also known as slow wave sleep, delta sleep or deep sleep), based primarily on the occurrence of synchronous physiologic EEG potentials. Drowsy awake with eyes closed is defined by the presence of alpha - the fre- quency with the most power on spectral analysis. Sleep onset (Stage N1) is generally defined as occurring at the point in which there is a decline of alpha rhythm (9\u2013 11 Hz) to less than 50% of the recorded epoch. Stage N2 sleep is denoted by bursts of sleep spindles at sigma fre- quency (11\u201316 Hz) and K-complex events - electro- physiological down states known to negatively affect the general tendency of neurons to develop spike potential activity (Cash et al. 2009). Deep sleep (stage N3 sleep) oc- curs in association with delta frequency oscillations (0.5\u2013 1.5 Hz). REM sleep is characterized by bursts of intracra- nial theta (5\u20138 Hz), with alpha and gamma oscillations noted in scalp recordings, associated with conjugate eye",

          "Sleep regulation is a complex interaction between the homeostatic and the endogenous circadian processes (Borb\u00e9ly et al. 2016). The circadian processes of sleep are largely controlled by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus (Dai et al. 1998; Hofman et al. 1996; Swaab et al. 1985; Vimal et al. 2009). This in- ternal human clock responds to external factors with the greatest influence being exposure to light/dark (LD) cycle (Lewy et al. 1980; Morin 2015). The other import- ant element to the timing of the sleep/wake cycle is the endogenously produced neural hormone melatonin, pro- duced by the pineal gland in response to signals from the SCN. Melatonin can induce sedation, an effect sometimes utilized to assist children in tolerating med- ical procedures (Johnson et al. 2002). In addition to regulation of the sleep/wake cycle, body temperature and numerous other processes vary with circadian rhythm (Sack et al. 2007). Externally introduced",

          "Metformin is listed by the World Health Organization as an essential medicine to treat and prevent type 2 diabetes. As a biguanide, metformin is related to guanidine and galegine, which can both be extracted from goat\u2019s rue (Galega officionalis). This medicinal plant was traditionally used in medieval Europe as a treat- ment for diabetes and other ailments, including infections such as the plague and typhoid fever. Metformin was first synthesized in 1922, but its use as an antidiabetic agent was only proposed in 1957, a discovery closely linked to malaria owing to the structural relatedness of metformin to proguanil, a highly potent antimalarial biguanide. In the 1940s, metformin was tested in patients with an ongoing malaria blood stage infection while a search was underway for alternatives to proguanil, which was becoming ineffective because of parasite resistance (34, 37). Although no clear effect on parasitemia was found (34), lowered glucose levels were later noticed after metformin treatment (37). Indeed, the antihyperglycemia property appears to be common to most biguanides, but metformin outperforms with minimal lactic acidosis. With a long track record of clinical use, metformin has proved to be highly tolerable, with a strong safety profile and few interactions with other medications. In addition, metformin is water-soluble, is orally bioavail- able, has excellent pharmacokinetic adsorption and excretion properties, and has a low cost of production, making it highly affordable and accessible (37, 38). These properties contribute to metformin\u2019s qualifications as an optimal drug for repurposing (39). Interest in metformin repurposing has been sparked in recent years because of numerous epidemiologic observations and meta-analyses demonstrating positive outcomes and improved prognosis in diabetes patients diagnosed with cancer. To date more than 100 clinical trials in oncolo- gy are underway to determine the benefits of metformin as adjunctive therapy in treating and preventing cancer and longevity-related causes, such as inflammation, senescence, and oxidative damage (39\u201341). It is also being studied as a potential adjunctive therapy to treat infections such as tuberculosis (25, 42) and AIDS (43). The mechanism of action of metformin is not fully defined because it appears to have multiple pleio- tropic direct and indirect effects on various cell processes and cell targets. In the treatment of diabetes, metformin is widely used to decrease glucose production and output from the liver and increase circulating insulin sensitivity. These effects are thought to be a result of metformin\u2019s interaction with mitochondria, where it alters cellular bioenergetics by inhibiting the respiratory chain complex I. This leads to a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation and subsequent drop in energy with altered ADP-to-ATP ratios (22, 44, 45). As a consequence, several pathways are affected, such as through the activation of the energy sensor AMPK and a shutdown in gluconeogenesis (46\u201348). AMPK-dependent processes that are altered include suppression of mTOR and insulin receptor signaling (IGF-I) via PI3K/AKT pathways, leading to decreased protein synthesis and cell growth and increased apoptosis and autophagy (49).

          "A patient\u2019s decision to use an OON provider selection may be intentional or accidental. Reasons patients may incur OON costs include patient preference for a particular provider or specialty care center that may be out of network, the lack of network providers with appropriate specialists, and the lack of awareness or transparency about which providers are in the patient\u2019s plan network. Common scenarios for accidental use of OON providers are emergency care or care from an OON provider working at an in-network hospital (e.g., radiologist, assistant surgeon, anesthesiologist).22 23 Figure 9 suggests that there might be significant financial consequences to the patient going out of network, which could be exacerbated if health plans remove popular cancer providers from their networks. Figure 9 also provides information on the relationship between the OON percentage (right vertical axis--relative to total spending) and total patient cost-sharing (left vertical axis). While most patients in our study reported under 10% of all OOP cost in the year of diagnosis is spent on out-of- network providers, those in the highest percentile of OOP spending incurred as much as 40% of those costs out-of-network.",

        "OOP costs in the year of diagnosis came mostly from professional and non-inpatient facility services. Figure 8 shows the level of OOP costs by percentile for all study cancers combined. In general, patient cost-sharing is higher for out-of-network services than in-network. Not surprisingly, cancer patients in the highest decile of OOP spending also incurred the highest portion of OOP costs for out- of-network providers; conversely, patients in the lowest decile incurred the lowest portion of OOP costs for out-of-network providers."

Screening tests are being performed per the direction and authority of the Healthwaves Medical Director, Patrick N. Connell, M.D. or as otherwise designated on the laboratory requisition or results forms.

          "Table 6\u2014Common Comorbid Psychiatric Disorders and Symptoms II. Pre-Sleep Conditions: Patients with insomnia may de- velop behaviors that have the unintended consequence of per- petuating their sleep problem. These behaviors may begin as strategies to combat the sleep problem, such as spending more time in bed in an effort to \u201ccatch up\u201d on sleep. Other behaviors in bed or in the bedroom that are incompatible with sleep may include talking on the telephone, watching television, computer use, exercising, eating, smoking, or \u201cclock watching.\u201d Insom- nia patients may report sensations of being more aware of the environment than are other individuals and may report antici- pating a poor sleep hours before bedtime, and become more alert and anxious as bedtime approaches. Characterization of the sleeping environment (couch/bed, light/dark, quiet/noisy, room temperature, alone/bed partner, TV on/off) as well as the patient\u2019s state of mind (sleepy vs. wide awake, relaxed vs. anx- ious) is helpful in understanding which factors might facilitate or prolong sleep onset or awakenings after sleep. III. Sleep-Wake Schedule: In evaluating sleep-related symptoms, the clinician must consider not only the patient\u2019s \u201cusual\u201d symptoms, but also their range, day-to-day variability, and evolution over time. Specific sleep-wake variables such as",

        [
          "time to fall asleep (sleep latency), number of awakenings, wake time after sleep onset (WASO), sleep duration, and napping can be quantified retrospectively during the clinical assessment and prospectively with sleep-wake logs. Although no specific quan- titative sleep parameters define insomnia disorder, common complaints for insomnia patients are an average sleep latency >30 minutes, wake after sleep onset >30 minutes, sleep effi- ciency <85%, and/or total sleep time <6.5 hours.19,20 Day-to-day variability should be considered, as well as variability during longer periodicities such as those that may occur with the men- strual cycle or seasons. Patterns of sleep at unusual times may assist in identifying Circadian Rhythm Disorders such as Ad- vanced Sleep Phase Type or Delayed Sleep Phase Type. Assess- ing whether the final awakening occurs spontaneously or with an alarm adds insight into the patient\u2019s sleep needs and natural sleep and wake rhythm. Finally, the clinician must ascertain whether the individual\u2019s sleep and daytime complaints occur despite adequate time available for sleep, in order to distinguish insomnia from behaviorally induced insufficient sleep. IV. Nocturnal Symptoms: Patient and bed partner reports may also help to identify nocturnal signs, symptoms and behav- iors associated with breathing-related sleep disorders (snoring, gasping, coughing), sleep related movement disorders (kick- ing, restlessness), parasomnias (behaviors or vocalization), and comorbid medical/neurological disorders (reflux, palpitations, seizures, headaches). Other physical sensations and emotions associated with wakefulness (such as pain, restlessness, anxi- ety, frustration, sadness) may contribute to insomnia and should also be evaluated. V. Daytime Activities and Daytime Function: Daytime activities and behaviors may provide clues to potential causes and consequences of insomnia. Napping (frequency/day, times, voluntary/involuntary), work (work times, work type such as driving or with dangerous consequences, disabled, caretaker responsibilities), lifestyle (sedentary/active, home- bound, light exposure, exercise), travel (especially across time zones), daytime dysfunction (quality of life, mood, cog- nitive dysfunction), and exacerbation of comorbid disorders should be evaluated in depth. Common daytime consequences include:",

          "\u2022 Mood disturbances and cognitive difficulties. Complaints of irritability, loss of interest, mild depression and anxi- ety are common among insomnia patients. Patients with chronic insomnia often complain of mental inefficiency, difficulty remembering, difficulty focusing attention, and difficulty with complex mental tasks. \u2022 Quality of life: The irritability and fatigue associated with insomnia may cause interpersonal difficulties for insomnia patients, or avoidance of such activities. Conversely, in- terpersonal difficulties may be an important contributor to insomnia problems for some individuals. Sleep and wak- ing problems may lead to restriction of daytime activities, including social events, exercise, or work. Lack of regular daytime activities and exercise may in turn contribute to insomnia. \u2022 Exacerbation of comorbid conditions. Comorbid condi- tions may cause or increase sleep difficulties. Likewise, poor sleep may exacerbate symptomatology of comorbid conditions. Sleep complaints may herald the onset of mood disorders or exacerbation of comorbid conditions. VI. Other History: A complete insomnia history also in- cludes medical, psychiatric, medication/substance, and family/ social/occupational histories. A wide range of medical (Table 5) and psychiatric (Table 6) conditions can be comorbid with",

          "insomnia. Likewise, the direct effects of over-the-counter and prescription medications and substances (Table 7), and their effects upon withdrawal, may impact both sleep and daytime symptoms. Conditions often comorbid with insomnia, such as mood and anxiety disorders, may also have familial or genetic components. Social and occupational histories may indicate not only the effects of insomnia on the individual, but also possible contributing factors. Occupational assessment should specifi- cally include work around dangerous machinery, driving duties, regular or irregular shift-work and transmeridian travel. Physical and Mental Status Examination: Chronic in- somnia is not associated with any specific features on physi- cal or mental status examination. However, these exams may provide important information regarding comorbid conditions and differential diagnosis. A physical exam should specifically evaluate risk factors for sleep apnea (obesity, increased neck circumference, upper airway restrictions) and comorbid medi- cal conditions that include but are not limited to disorders of pulmonary, cardiac, rheumatologic, neurological, endocrine (such as thyroid), and gastrointestinal systems. The mental sta- tus exam should focus on mood, anxiety, memory, concentra- tion, and degree of alertness or sleepiness. Supporting Information: While a thorough clinical history and exam form the core of the evaluation, differential diagno- sis is further aided by the use of sleep logs, questionnaires for sleep quality, sleepiness, psychological assessment and quality of life (Table 8), and in some cases, actigraphy.21-23 For specific insomnias, psychological testing, quality of life questionnaires, and other comorbid questionnaires and testing are useful. The choice of assessment tools should be based on the patient\u2019s pre- sentation and the clinician\u2019s expertise. At minimum, the patient should complete: (1) A general medical/psychiatric/medication questionnaire (to identify comorbid disorders and medication use) (2) The Epworth Sleepiness Scale or other sleepiness assess- ment (to identify sleepy patients)24 (3) A two-week sleep log to identify sleep-wake times, gen- eral patterns, and day-to-day variability. When possible, questionnaires and a two-week sleep log should be completed prior to the first visit to begin the process",

          "was achieved using 2 complementary approaches, mir- roring the approaches used in the first 2 phases: data- informed and consensus-based. From the consensus- based approach, the expert panel was asked to examine the rankings of case scenarios based on the new scoring system and to indicate, in their opinion, the point at which the cases changed from \u201cprobable\u201d to \u201cdefinite\u201d RA. Four cases were excluded due to missing domain information (n (cid:2) 2) or ineligibility (2 cases were more likely another diagnosis). For the remaining 50 cases, the mean cut point defining definite RA was 65.7 (median 66.1; range 60.0\u201370.3) of a total possible score of 100. A data-driven verification of that cut point was then attempted, in which the new scoring system was applied to 3 of the existing cohorts used for Phase 1 (the Etude et Suivi des Polyarthrites Indifferenciees Re- centes data set from France, the Norwegian data set, and the Rotterdam Early Arthritis Cohort data set from Rotterdam) (25). These cohorts were chosen based on the completeness of data and the collected variables, enabling calculation of the patients\u2019 probability scores at baseline. The disease characteristics of these cohorts were not substantively different from those of the re- maining cohorts (data not shown). The area under the curve (AUC) for the 3 receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (which plot sensitivity against 1 (cid:3) specificity for the range of scores) indicated good discrimination of those who did versus those who did not receive MTX (or another DMARD/biologic agent) within a year (AUC 0.82 for Norway, 0.66 for France, and AUC 0.69 for Rotterdam; P (cid:4) 0.0001 for all). The probability scores similarly discriminated between those who fulfilled the 1987 ACR criteria at 12 months and those who did not (AUC for the ROC curves 0.88 [Norway], 0.67 [France], and 0.72 [Rotterdam]). Visual inspection of the diagnostic test parameters associated with curves that used MTX initi- ation as the outcome showed a maximum slope for both the positive and negative likelihood ratios between a score of 60/100 and 70/100, with flattening thereafter (67 in the Norway cohort, 66 in the French cohort, and 66 in the Rotterdam cohort). The cut point of 60\u201370 that was derived from expert consensus was therefore supported by these data. Given the consistency with the consensus- based approach, and to maximize sensitivity of the criteria, a cut point of 60 was deemed to be most appropriate. Rationale for the composition and weight of the final criteria. For development of the final criteria set, the results and weights from the comprehensive Phase 2 process (26) were used as a starting point. Based on",

Depending on the seriousness or other important clinical implications of an adverse reaction, it may also be discussed in greater detail in other labeling sections, in particular the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and BOXED WARNING sections.14 For example, the ADVERSE REACTIONS section of approved human drug labeling is explicitly required to \u201cdescribe the overall adverse reaction profile of the drug based on the entire safety database.\u201d15 The threshold for inclusion of an adverse event16 in approved human drug labeling is a determination that \u201cthere is some basis to believe there is a causal relationship between the drug and the occurrence of the adverse event.\u201d17 Whether there is some basis to believe there is a causal relationship is a matter of judgment based on factors such as: (1) the frequency of reporting of the event, (2) whether the adverse event rate for a drug exceeds the placebo rate, (3) the extent of dose-response, (4) the extent to which the adverse event is consistent with the pharmacology of the drug, (5) the timing of the event relative to the time of drug exposure, (6)",

          "Phase 1. The aim of Phase 1 was to identify the contributions of clinical and laboratory variables that in practice were the most predictive of the decision to initiate DMARD therapy in a population of patients with early undifferentiated synovitis. Initiation of DMARD therapy was used as an indicator of the physician\u2019s opinion that the patient was at risk of developing persistent and/or erosive arthritis that we would currently consider to be RA. Data on 3,115 patients from 9 early arthritis cohorts who were consid- ered not to have evidence of another possible diagnosis explaining their presentation were obtained. Between July 2007 and November 2008 an expert working group developed an analysis strategy that related an agreed- upon list of standardized clinical and laboratory vari- ables collected at baseline to the initiation of DMARD treatment within the next 12 months. MTX initiation was used as the gold standard for this purpose. The analytical process aimed to identify the independent contribution of each variable on this list and included univariate regression modeling, a subsequent principal components analysis, and a multivariate regression model that included all identified components (25). The resulting list of informative variables identified during that process and the weights based on the odds ratios are shown in Table 1. Phase 2. Phase 2 consisted of a consensus-based, decision science\u2013informed approach, which took place between November 2008 and June 2009.

An expert panel was assembled, comprising 12 rheumatologists from Europe and 12 from North Amer- ica with extensive experience in the diagnosis and man- agement of RA. They provided real-life case scenarios of patients with early undifferentiated inflammatory arthri- tis representing low to high probability of developing RA. A 2-day workshop was held in May 2009 in which domains (factors) and categories within those domains that were important in determining the probability of developing RA were identified. When appropriate, these judgments were informed by the results of Phase 1 and other available literature. The relative importance or weights of these domains and their categories were determined by means of decision science theory and conjoint adaptive technology, using the computerized 1000Minds program (www.1000minds.com) in an inter- active and iterative process (26). This analysis permitted the calculation of an individual\u2019s score of the likelihood of developing RA from 0 to 100, where a higher score indicated greater likelihood of RA development. The domains, categories, and weights derived during that initial process are shown in Table 2.",

In Phase 3 the working group integrated the findings of the first 2 phases, refined the scoring system, and determined the optimal cut point to define \u201cdefinite RA.\u201d The goal of this final phase was to utilize the results of Phases 1 and 2 to develop a scoring system that would be applicable to newly presenting patients with undifferentiated inflam- matory arthritis to permit identification of those with a high probability of developing persistent and/or erosive RA. Being intended for use with newly presenting patients, the scoring system should be robust enough that it could be applied repeatedly during the early course of disease, such that a patient identified as not classifiable as having definite RA at initial presentation might be classified as having definite RA at a subsequent time point. The work was not aimed at classifying subjects with established disease, either active or inac- tive. However, the working group recognized that pa- tients may present for the first time with disease that is at a later stage and being treated.

These chemical exposures are used as potent tools to design controlled studies with predictable levels of PA episodes. In a study with healthy volunteer subjects using carbon dioxide inhalation to provoke panic and anxiety, propranolol significantly decreased heart rate, a cardiovascular somatic symptom, but did not provide psychic anxiolytic benefit [35].",

          "Propranolol has also been investigated in patients suffering from severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Two clinical studies of this beta blocker have shown possible benefits in the early-stage interventional prevention and subsequent therapy of PTSD [36,37]. Subsequent reports have also echoed that propranolol might be effective for this condition [38-40], although other reports dispute this conclusion [41,42]. When considered in aggregate these clinical studies of propranolol, as the well known prototypical beta blocker, provide convincing evidence that the drug can exert somatic (i.e., peripheral) effects on the cardiovascular system in the context of panic and anxiety disorders. With regard to affecting the psychic (CNS) symptoms, the results have been negative, inconsistent, or inconclusive. That being said, there is some limited evidence that propranolol can exert some psychic (CNS) benefits in clinical stress trials. In a pair of clinical studies, propranolol (a central and peripheral beta-blocker) significantly enhanced problem solving during stress, whereas nadolol (peripheral only beta-blocker) and lorezapam (benzodiazepine) did not [43, 44]. Thus, propranolol enhanced cognitive flexibility (\u201ccreativity\u201d) during stress. It remains unclear whether propranolol alone can appreciably reduce psychic effects. In aggregate the clinical evidence does not support a benefit regarding psychic (CNS) anxiety symptoms.",

          "Numerous alternative beta blockers are available in lieu of propranolol. Notable among these is the common drug, atenolol, that is available in oral solid dose forms ranging from 25 to 100 mg for the treatment of hypertension. Multiple doses per day may be permitted. It has been used to suppress stage fright in performers when administered orally in advance [45]. Atenolol is a beta-1 selective peripheral-acting agent without CNS effects, which should reduce the risk for asthmatic subjects [46]. Thus, atenolol might be preferred over the nonselective beta blockers for patients affected by asthma or COPD [47]. Oral atenolol at 50 - 200 mg doses suppressed heart rate by ~ 23 - 24 beats per minute (bpm) vs. ~ 10 bpm on placebo [46]. Also,",

In a clinical trial with musicians, nadolol reduced pulse rate and improved one aspect of performance related to tremor [48]. A similar result was obtained for nadolol in students\u2019 singing performance [49]. In spite of being non- selective, nadolol might ironically benefit the pulmonary function in asthma patients based upon the appropriate dosage, an anti-intuitive result [50].",

Pindolol reduced symptoms of performance anxiety in musicians [51]. Another example is betaxolol that can also cross the blood- brain barrier. Daily oral betaxalol was delivered at 5 - 40 mg per day in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and other anxiety-related conditions. Anxiety and panic attacks were reduced within several days [52]. This anxiolytic benefit is prophylactic, as the effects are observed in days, rather than in minutes.",

          "Beta blockers also exhibit some benefit with regard to alcohol and drug abuse. The abuse of alcohol, prescription drugs, and illegal drugs (e.g., opioids, opiates, and cocaine) are major mental health care concerns. The repetitive abuse of these chemicals can produce physiologic dependence, tolerance, addiction, and neurologic damage. The symptoms of sudden withdrawal depend upon the abused substance, the impairment of neurological and neuroendocrine pathways, as well as somatic organ impairment. The withdrawal from addictive substances produces an array of symptoms, many of which overlap with the symptoms of panic and acute anxiety episodes. Delirium tremens (DTs) occur in some alcoholics upon abrupt cessation of drinking. The symptoms of alcohol-related DTs are very similar to those of panic attacks, and are in part related to beta adrenergic effects. The DTs can have serious and even life- threatening consequences. The standards-of-care for DTs are oral benzodiazepines. Withdrawal from opioid and/or opiate addiction is physiologically distinct from alcohol withdrawal.",

Note that propranolol has also been shown to suppress tremors [61], consistent with one of the perceived benefits of beta blockers in performance anxiety in musicians (above).",

Cancers of the prostate and colon and rectum, and melanoma are the three most prevalent among males, whereas cancers of the breast, uterine corpus, and colon and rectum are most prevalent among females. It is important to note that the number of total survivors is fewer than the sum of all cancers combined because some people are diagnosed with more than one type of cancer. The majority of cancer survivors (67%) were diagnosed 5 or more years ago, and 17% were diagnosed 20 or more years ago (Table 1). Nearly half (47%) of survivors are 70 years of age or older, while only 11% are younger than 50 (Table 2).",

Cancers of the prostate and colon and rectum, and melanoma are the three most prevalent among males, whereas cancers of the breast, uterine corpus, and colon and rectum are most prevalent among females. It is important to note that the number of total survivors is fewer than the sum of all cancers combined because some people are diagnosed with more than one type of cancer. The majority of cancer survivors (67%) were diagnosed 5 or more years ago, and 17% were diagnosed 20 or more years ago (Table 1). Nearly half (47%) of survivors are 70 years of age or older, while only 11% are younger than 50 (Table 2).",

          "Lung cancer and colorectal cancer patients had significant use of hospital inpatient services soon after diagnosis, which suggests that many patients underwent inpatient surgery in months 0 or 1. By contrast, breast cancer patients had less inpatient spending in months 0 and 1 and lower overall spending. The average monthly total healthcare spending started to drop two to three months after diagnosis. The mix of costs then became more consistently distributed across various service categories, which may reflect the varying approaches used to treat individual survivors. For example, by the time breast cancer patients reach the second month after diagnosis, the balance of services have shifted to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The pattern of spending by category shown in Figures 2a-2c illustrates an \u201caggregate\u201d patient journey for these cancers\u2014individual patients may not follow these patterns.",

Over the 47- month period following diagnosis, patients who we could track had average cumulative total healthcare costs of $101,000 for breast cancer, $165,000 for colorectal cancer, and $282,000 for lung cancer. The cumulative figures by month since diagnosis are represented in the left axis using solid lines. Patient OOP costs are shown as dashed lines using the right axis. Relative to total average spending of $101,000 to $282,000 for the 4 year period, the patient OOP of $7,500 to $11,000 suggests that ESI provides substantial protection to many patients. We note that patient contributions to premium would be in addition to the patient OOP costs. Premium contributions averaged approximately $1,100 per employee per year for single coverage, and over $5,000 for family coverage in 2016.20 Patients may face other costs not reflected in these data such as travel expenses and loss of income.",

(2008) as emotional, physical, nutritional, financial, informational, treatment- and employment-related, and daily living activi- ties. Other reasons included an identified dissatisfaction with conventional care (Richardson et al., 2000; Saxe et al., 2008), fragmentation of care into survivorship, lack of empathy and support, or if a survivor\u2019s subsequent needs were unfulfilled (Mao et al., 2008). In addition, Carpenter et al. (2008) identi- fied decreased emotional function and multiple medical issues in very long-term breast cancer survivors who used CAM. The potential for recurrence and high levels of worry (Mao et al., 2008) and distress (Lawsin et al., 2007) also were reported with increased use. Finally, the use of herbal supplements were reportedly used to reduce the side effects of treatment and to boost immune function (Buettner et al., 2006; Deng et al., 2004; Lawsin et al., 2007; Richardson et al., 2000; Saxe et al., 2008).",

          "To provide quality care to the cancer survivor, oncology nurses should understand the characteristics and reasons for CAM use and examine personal views and beliefs regarding CAM. Once personal biases and beliefs have been identified, the nurse can explore reasons for looking into the use of these therapies with the patient. Nurses should approach CAM with a non-judgmental attitude (Saxe et al., 2008) to avoid non-report- ing of CAM use by the patient. Saxe et al. (2008) and Frenkel et al. (2005) reported that patients often do not report the use of CAM primarily because of the healthcare provider\u2019s negative attitudes or limited knowledge regarding their use. Addition- ally, the patient or survivor may choose only to disclose one of multiple CAM therapies that they are using (Saxe et al., 2008). Robinson and McGrail (2004) reported that disclosure rates of CAM use ranged from 23%\u201390%. Chen, Bernard, and Cottrell (1999) demonstrated lower reporting to physicians who did not practice some form of CAM (67%) versus those who did (90%). Disclosure remains important to consider because patients who are seeing CAM providers and subsequently engaging in CAM treatments in addition to conventional care may cause interrup- tion in their treatment and potential harm to themselves (Saxe et al., 2008). Cultural sensitivity also is essential for understanding CAM use. Cultural beliefs are important in the acceptance of, or mistrust with, conventional health care. This can lead to subse- quent rejection of Western health care (Mao et al., 2008). Nursing assessment should focus on psychological processes of the patient (Gansler et al., 2008), including fear, quality of life, and spiritual values, as well as feelings of hope, optimism, and personal control (Richardson et al., 2000) (see Table 2). An evaluation of common characteristics may assist the pro- vider in identification of increased use. An example of this is that supplement use has been reported to be associated with survivors with increased exercise and dietary changes that in- cluded increased fruit and vegetable intake (Gunther, Patterson, Kristal, Stratton, & White, 2004; Miller et al., 2008). Preliminary assessment also should include factors such as financial concerns related to care, cancer type, stage, prognosis,",

          "and end-of-life issues, because diagnoses such as breast cancer are associated with increased CAM use in conjunction with con- ventional treatment (Deng et al., 2004; Mao et al., 2008). Nurses need to possess a good understanding of the survivor\u2019s motiva- tion surrounding the use of CAM. Addressing unmet needs, side-effect management, and conducting an evaluation of the patient\u2019s understanding of safety in these therapies is imperative in future survivor care. Because CAM use is more likely related to symptom treatment, such as pain, fatigue, and hot flashes (Mao et al., 2008), a thorough focus on side-effect management also is an essential component of survivorship.",

A cancer is cured when all traces of the cancer have been removed from the patient\u2019s body. Although it is usually not possible to know if the cancer is completely eradicated, for many patients, the initial course of therapy is successful and the cancer never returns. However, some cancer- free survivors must cope with the long-term effects of treatment, as well as psychological concerns such as fear of recurrence.

IC 50values can be determined by linear regression analyses on the linear segments of the dose\u2013response curves. Although 3H-hypoxanthine incorporation is the most commonly used method to assay antimalarial activity in vitro,it is costly,radioactive and quite com- plex,and therefore problematic for resource-poor loca- tions or for high-throughput screening (HTS,reviewed in REF. 51). A low-cost alternative for testing small numbers ofcompounds is to incubate parasites with test compounds (typically for 48 or 72 hours),and then to compare parasitaemias oftreated and control parasites by counting GIEMSA-stained parasites by light microscopy. Another established,but less standardized,assay involves the colorimetric detection of lactate dehydrogenase52. Flow cytometry has also been used to test candidate anti- malarial compounds,and takes advantage ofthe fact that human erythrocytes lack DNA.In the simplest use ofthis technology, parasites are fixed after the appropriate period ofincubation with test compounds,then either the parasitized cells are stained with hydroethidine (which is metabolized to ethidium53) or the parasite nuclei are stained with DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2- phenylindole).Counts oftreated and control cultures are then obtained by flow cytometry.Appropriate gating can",

Compounds that meet an acceptable cut-off for in vitroactivity (for example,IC 50\u22641 \u00b5M) can then be tested for activity against a range ofgeographically dis- tinct P.falciparum lines of differing drug-resistance phenotypes (see Further Information,Antimalarial drug discovery:efficacy models for compound screening) to determine whether resistance to existing antimalarial drugs reduces parasite sensitivity to the compounds under evaluation. Different research groups have incorporated a variety of modifications of the basic in vitro screens listed above,which can influence the measurement of drug activity levels,as follows.",

Insomnia  may  occur\n                                                 during  periods of use/exposure,  or during discontinuation.  When   the identified substance is\n                                                 stopped,  and after discontinuation effects subside, the insomnia is expected to resolve or sub-\n                                                 stantially improve.\nInsomnia  Due  to Medical  Condition             The  essential feature of this disorder is insomnia  caused  by a  coexisting medical  disorder\n                                                 or other physiological  factor.

A thorough program of efflorescence prevention or control may include identification of the type of efflorescence and investigation of its causes before options for correction are considered. This Technical Note is intended to serve as a guide in this process. Procedures for removal of efflorescence are discussed in Technical Note 20.",

Simply stated, efflorescence occurs when water containing dissolved salts is brought to the surface of masonry, the water evaporates and the salts are left on the surface of the masonry. The salt solutions may migrate across surfaces of masonry units, between the mortar and units, or through the pores of the mortar or units.",

Here again to ensure that graph 2 illustrates general behavior of abrasive particle mesh size, all other conditions were examined and in just one condition a little deviation from regular behavior had been observed. In this case, possible reason for this happening could be increase in cutting edges by increase in mesh number. Besides, the greater the abrasive particles, the bigger their cutting edges are, so scratches made by these bigger cutting edges are greater than smaller particles. Therefore, smaller abrasive particles produce a better surface quality. Finally, to examine effect of finishing time cycle, last set of experiments with the following condition has been conducted: Magnetic field strength of 0.8T, abrasive particle mesh size of 400, finishing cycles of 30, 45 and 60 minutes.

Therefore, surface roughness in this region improves and there will be a finer surface than first. However, in the second part from 45 to 60 minutes, excess abrasion time makes fine surface scratched by continuing abrasion after removal of peaks. However, this conclusion may not be completely true or even may not be the only reason, because abrasive particles will be abraded themselves after such a long period of finishing. Here this hypothesis appears that maybe, probable abrasive particle fracture due to smash through finishing process makes them sharp again and these new sharp cutting edges even in smaller size, continue abrasion and make surface ragged.

          "1. Decide when to clean. Mortar must harden prior to cleaning. It is generally best to schedule cleaning at least seven days after brickwork is completed. In some cases it may be possible to clean earlier; how- ever, effects on the masonry and influencing factors such as weather conditions and the type of brick and mortar should be carefully considered. Prolonged time periods between the completion of the masonry and cleaning should be avoided. After one month, mortar smears and splatters left on brickwork become increasingly difficult to remove. 2. Remove larger clumps of mortar using wooden paddles or nonmetallic tools. Metal tools may damage the brickwork or leave behind fragments that oxidize and cause rust stains. 3. Select the proper cleaning solution. There are many types of proprietary cleaners available that are for- mulated to remove specific stains or for use with a particular type of brick. Be careful to select cleaning products suitable for the brick, mortar and adjacent materials and follow the cleaner manufacturer\u2019s rec- ommended instructions. Each product being considered should be evaluated as discussed previously in Trial Cleaning.",

Mask or otherwise protect windows, doors, and materials such as sealants, metal, glass, wood, limestone, cast stone, concrete masonry and ornamental trim from cleaning solutions. Cleaning chemicals may also damage plants and grass. It may be necessary to pre- vent the cleaning solution and run-off from contacting plants or the surrounding soil. 5. Saturate the area to be cleaned. Flush with water from the top down. Saturated brick masonry will not absorb the cleaning solution or dissolved mortar particles. Areas below the area being cleaned should also be saturated and kept wet until after the final rinse to prevent streaking and absorption of the run-off from above.",

Portland cement-lime, mortar cement, or masonry cement mortars can be used. However, mortars with an air content less than 12 percent are recommended for their superior bond strength and resistance to moisture penetration. The MSJC Code requires that the allowable flexural tensile stresses be reduced by approximately 50 percent for assemblies constructed with masonry cement mortars or portland cement-lime mortars that have air entrainment. In addition, some building codes prohibit the use of masonry cement mortars and all Type N mortars in Seismic Performance Categories D and E (formerly Seismic Zones 3 and 4). Mortar should meet the proportion requirements of ASTM C 270 Specification for Mortar for Unit Masonry as shown in Table 1. Mortar type selection should be based on project requirements, such as strength and compatibility with a particular brick unit. Types N or S mortars are typically used in brick masonry cavity walls.

This index indicates the change in price level for pharmaceuticals relative to the change in price level for all goods and services (i.e. all-item consumer price index) against a nominated baseline year (i.e. 1981). These two countries were chosen for illustrative purpose because of their contrasting health care systems and approaches for managing medicine prices: the Australian Government is known to have implemented a range of pricing policies for medicines over the past decades for its single-payer national pharmaceutical insurance scheme \u2013 the PBS; the USA on the other hand is known for its market-based health care, with multiple private and public insurers and with minimal government intervention for the pricing of medicines.",

          "prices of pharmaceuticals grew faster than the collective prices of all goods and services (Fig. 4.6a, p.61). However, the trends in the two countries began to diverge in the late 1980s where the price level of medicines continued to rise faster in the USA, while the growth rate of pharmaceutical prices in Australia seemed to have been stabilized at around 10% higher than the consumer price index. This could possibly be due to the introduction of \u201ccost effectiveness\u201d as a requirement before listing a medicine on the national pharmaceutical insurance scheme, so as to ensure the benefits of a given medicine were high enough to justify the price requested by the manufacturer (246). The divergence became more prominent when the Australian Government undertook further reforms of its national scheme after 2005 (247), which was implemented in response to a report that warned \u201cin 40 years\u2019 time, the PBS could account for 3.4% of GDP, making it the largest part of the Government\u2019s spending on health\u201d (248). The reforms seem to have resulted in gradual normalization of the growth rate of medicine prices in Australia to a level in line with the overall inflation rate of other consumer goods (Fig. 4.6a). In contrast, medicine prices continued to grow considerably in the USA, with the cumulative growth reaching 2.4 times the overall inflation rate of other consumer goods in 2017. Of note, the price level of prescription medicines in the USA rose in parallel with Pricing and reimbursement policies in Australia over four decades have controlled the growth rate of medicine prices.",

The recognized subsections were: research topic and definitions, research objectives (questions), methodological techniques, experimental set-up, object of the study (e.g. study area), main discoveries (analysed data), answers on research questions, explanation of the conclusions and further research and implications. The main RAS's are listed in a flow chart, showing main relations between different sections (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 shows the substructure of Introduction and Discussion RAS as the most important RAS's.",

Evaluating \u2013 can include commenting on the degrees of success and failure of something, or the value of something The ability to analyze and creatively adapt to new situations is at the heart of critical thinking. Paul and Elder (2008, 2014b) asserted that critical thinking provides a vehicle for educating the mind. John Dewey would agree, as from his early work, we have increased our sense of the pragmatic basis of human thought (its instrumental nature), and especially its grounding in actual human purposes, goals, and objectives. Dewey (1910) also discussed critical thinking in terms of reflective thinking, which is an uneasiness in accepting the status quo and that critical thinking is both an emotional and intellectual component. Students must, therefore, be taught to examine, poke, question, and reflect on what they have learned. Scepticism, questioning, and reflection is essential. Dewey also stated that schools should have an intimate relationship with the community it serves. From the review of the research concerning critical thinking and what components are considered important in high school education and later a life-long learning skill, the authors developed a 5-step, critical thinking teaching process as outlined in Table 2. Input from the study\u2019s nine experts who reviewed the model and from suggestions from other model developers, led to the selection of easy to remember letters that describe each step\u2019s process.",

          "Second, deepening of institutional structure should be an ongoing project, particularly as it relates to bioethical codes (Baker, 2015; Tartzian et al., 2015), as well as proactive institutional engage- ment to improve responsiveness (Fenton et al., 2015). Institutional engagement with the future of the bioethics field is required to steward professionalism (White et al., 2014) and populate the health professions with those trained in bioethics, given radical changes in biomedical research and practice to come (Grady, 2013). This is particularly important given the rise of Big Data, as well as new biomedical methodologies such as crowdsourcing applied to biomedical research (Callaghan, 2014a; 2014b). Third, explicit engagement with issues relating to channels of communication around biotech de- velopments is needed, in order to ensure narratives are not \u2018captured\u2019 by those with agendas (O\u2019Keefe et al., 2015) and validity of public knowledge is ensured through development of ap- propriate biomedicine vocabularies. These practical initiatives capture the spirit of citizen science theory (Bonney et al., 2009) in terms of increasing responsiveness of populations to issues which affect them, or democratisation of both scientific discovery and its scrutiny. Theory related to wicked problems, or problems at the nexus of human values and uncertainty (Rittel & Webber, 1973), together with citizen science theory may help bioethicists negotiate changes to come in the biomedical research landscape.",

        "In cavity wall construction, the prescribed air space acts as an insulating layer in addition to the masonry units. Thermal performance of the system can be further enhanced by placing insulation materials in the cavity. Insulation materials used in brick masonry cavity walls include inorganic cellular materials such as perlite and vermiculite, and organic cellular materials such as polystyrene, polyurethane, polyisocyanurate and foams. These insulation types are manufactured in the form of rigid boards, granular fills and foams. Each of these types, if properly used, will result in a more thermally efficient wall system. Although the most important characteristic for insulation is its thermal resistance, other properties should be considered including water absorption, combustibility, density, insect resistance and ease of installation. The following criteria can be used for the selection of insulation materials for brick masonry cavity walls:"

While researchers in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) have for long been working independently to develop methods that can support expert end users to identify, extract and understand information out of this data, it is obvious that an interdisciplinary approach to bring these two fields closer together can yield synergies in the application of these methods to weakly structured complex medical data sets. The aim is to support end users to learn how to interactively analyse information properties and to visualize the most relevant parts \u2013 in order to gain knowledge, and finally wisdom, to support a smarter decision making. The danger is not only to get overwhelmed by increasing masses of data, moreover, there is the risk of modelling artifacts.",

          "Data exploration has recently been hailed as the fourth paradigm in the investigation of nature, after empiricism, theory and computation (Bell, Hey & Szalay, 2009). Whether in astronomy or the life sciences, the flood of data requires sophisticated methods of handling. For example, researchers in bioinformatics collect, process and analyze masses of data, or in computational biology, they simulate biological systems, metabolic pathways, the behavior of a cell or how a protein is built (Hey, Tansley & Tolle, 2009). In clinical medicine, the end users are confronted with increased volumes of highly complex, noisy, high-dimensional, multivariate and often weakly- structured data (Holzinger, 2011c). The field of biomedical informatics concerns the information processing by both humans and computers, dealing with biomedical complexity (Patel, Kahol & Buchman, 2011) to support decision making which is still a central topic in biomedical informatics (Shortliffe, 2011).",

In other words, to enable effective human control over powerful machine intelligence and to integrate statistical methods with information visualization, to support human insight and decision making (Holzinger, 2011a). The broad application of business enterprise hospital information systems amasses large amounts of medical documents, which must be reviewed, observed, and analyzed by human experts (Holzinger et al., 2008a). All essential documents of the patient records contain a certain portion of data which has been entered in non- standardized format (aka free text). Although text can easily be created by the end users, the support of automatic analysis is extremely difficult (Gregory, Mattison & Linde, 1995), (Holzinger et al., 2000), (Lovis, Baud & Planche, 2000).",

          "The emergence of new forms of enterprise, discussed earlier in reference to sale of human tissues, and new forms of biotechnology, such as genetic engineering, are simply examples of this diver- gence, which arguably requires new thinking around how to radically increase transparency and accountability, as emergent technologies enable not only radically improved potential for innova- tion but also increasing connectivity between human stakeholders who are directly affected by these developments. This divergence arguably places bioethicists, and education and profession- alization of bioethics (White et al., 2014) at the forefront of strategic response to radical advances in biomedicine to come. However, given the uncertainty of \u2018wicked\u2019 problems (Rittel & Webber, 1973) related to complexity of human values negotiation over increasingly beneficial and hazard- ous potentialities, the last line of ethical resource might be the democratic population itself.",

We also found the concept de(cid:2)nitions vary widely in length. The CUI de(cid:2)nitions in the UMLS come from a va- riety of sources and there may exist more than one de(cid:2)nition per source. Unlike CUI de(cid:2)nitions, there does exist an ST de(cid:2)nition for each possible con- cept. The ST de(cid:2)nitions come from the same source and are approximately the same length but they are a broad categorization.

          "Preparing students to be able to think critically is one of the key goals for many professionals in higher education, and it is also a quality sought by most employers of university graduates (Sulaiman, Rahman, & Dzulkifli, 2008). Under a Thailand 4.0 vision, critical thinking skills are stated to be a key pillar among the goals for a new, knowledge-based economy (Jones & Pimdee, 2017). These skills, however, are limited, as according to a recent study evaluating logical thinking and analytical skills, of 6,235 students in ten Thai provinces, the average final score was just 36.5%, with only 2.09% passing the exam (Rujivanarom, 2016). Over 2,500 years ago Plato in his discussions of logic indicated that critical thinking is the tool that helps individuals find answers or solutions to a person\u2019s confusions and problems (Thayer-Bacon, 1998). Socrates, Plato\u2019s teacher, believed that discussion and critical thinking with knowledge reside in the mind of the individual, rather than a teacher transmitting knowledge to a student (Ornstein & Levine, 2006). Nearly 2,500 years later, scholars and educators are still discussing the mechanisms, importance, and outcomes of critical thinking skills (or lack thereof). Contemporary evidence of the importance of critical thinking skills for employment has been provided from the National Association of Colleges and Employers [NACE] (2016) which indicated that critical thinking/problem-solving skills were ranked most important by the 144 surveyed employers (Table 1). This is also consistent with the research results obtained by Bassham, Irwin, Nardone, and Wallace (2013) which indicated that college education is responsible for the development of critical thinking skills which, in their turn, lead to higher-order thinking. This is also consistent with (Costa & Kallick, 2014) who stated that critical thinking skills are consistently included in all the lists of essentials behind college and career readiness (Kraisuth & Panjakajornsak, 2017).",

Wall orienta- tion, color, brick wall type and presence and location of insulation are governing factors. It is possible for a dark, south facing wall to reach surface tempera- tures as high as 140 \u00baF (60 \u00baC), while the ambient air temperature is well below 100 \u00baF (38 \u00baC). The mean temperature of a 4 in. (102 mm) thick insulated brick veneer is very close to the surface temperature of the brick. A thicker or uninsulated wall may have a lower mean temperature than the outside surface. The tem- perature range experienced by brickwork is the differ- ence of the high and low mean temperatures of the brickwork. In practice, this range is usually taken as 100 \u00baF (38 \u00baC) and is based on the annual high and low temperature of the exterior ambient air.",

          "SINCE 2001, ALL state licensing boards have accepted the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensure Exam- ination of the United States (COMLEX-USA), which is produced by the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners (NBOME). The United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE), produced by the National Board of Med- ical Examiners (NMBE), is the licensing exam that all allo- pathic medical students are required to take. Both are comprised of three tests, called \u201csteps\u201d by the USMLE and \u201clevels\u201d by the COMLEX, which must be passed for a phy- sician to gain unlimited licensure to practice medicine in the United States. According to 2013 USMLE Performance Data pub- lished in the 2013 NBME Annual Report, 97 percent of MD students (N=19,108), 94 percent of DO students (N=2,680), and 79 percent of foreign medical students and gradu- ates (N=14,649) passed the USMLE Step 1 exam on their first attempt. The pass rates for the USMLE Step 2 exam (from 2012-2013) showed narrowing between the groups: 98 percent (N=18,658), 96 percent (N=1,615), and 84 per- cent (N=12,203), respectively.22 The reason only a minority of DO students elect to take the USMLE is because it is optional and not required for their licensure. Osteopathic medical students may elect to take the USMLE based on a variety of reasons, including the desire to pursue an allopathic residency program. Osteopathic medical students are unique in that they have the option to apply for osteopathic (AOA) residency programs, allo- pathic (ACGME) residency programs, dual-accredited pro- grams, or both AOA and ACGME programs. However, all osteopathic students are required to take the COMLEX, regardless of whether or not they elect to take the USMLE. Thus, those who do take the USMLE must take both exams, which slightly differ in their length, emphasis, and ques- tion type, although they cover similar material apart from OMM.",

The first, more obvious difference lies in the osteopathic physicians\u2019 use of osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM). While OMM is most commonly known by the general public to treat neuromusculoskeletal injury, DOs may utilize it in their diagnosis and treatment of disease involving internal organs and all other parts of the body as well. The other, more subtle \u2013 and arguably more important \u2013 distinction between the two professions is that osteopathic medicine offers a concise philosophy on which all clinical practice is based. Central to this philosophy is the belief that the body has an inherent healing mechanism that allows it to maintain health, resist illness, and recover from disease processes.

In times of disease, when a part of the body is functioning sub-optimally, other parts of the body come out of their natural state of health in order to compensate for the dysfunction. During this compensatory process, however, new dysfunctions may arise. Osteopathic physicians must work to adjust the body so as to realign its parts back to normal. Osteopathic manipulative medicine aims to restore the body\u2019s self-healing capacity by decreasing allo- static load, or the physiologic effects of chronic bodily stresses,1 and enhancing the immune system.",

We then calculate the cosine between the instance vector and each of the two concept vectors. The concept whose vector has the smallest cosine score is assigned to weight. We then repeat this process for fluctuated, past and months. We also plan to explore using different contex- tual information to improve the accuracy of our approach.

          "that likely affects anxiety/mood symptoms via the M2 and/or M1 receptors of the CNS [19]. Scopolamine was known over a century ago to produce a calming effect in psychiatric patients [20], although this property is not well known today among medical providers. There is clinical evidence that other antimuscarinic agents (e.g., promethazine), can also provide some anxiolytic benefit [6]. Beta blockers and antimuscarinic agents are included in the PanX\u00ae combinations not only for pharmacologic targeting of the sympathetic beta-1 and parasympathetic M2/M1 receptors, but also in view of historic safety. Both classes of drugs have been used in millions of patients over five decades and are known to be safe. Neither class is addictive. In addition, the high prevalence of use strongly suggests that both classes of medicines have been coincidentally and/or concurrently used in the same patient(s) as separate prescriptions and/or OTC drugs, for instance a prescription beta blocker for hypertension and a prescription or OTC antimuscarinic agent for motion sickness, nausea, or vomiting. Even with high coincident and/or concurrent use, there is no evidence in the population of producing side effects or drug-drug interactions that extend beyond those inherent within either of the monotherapies. Prior to this open label study, case series resulting from physician- sponsored studies of compounded atenolol - scopolamine provided initial evidence of effectiveness in the PRN treatment of anxiety. Three patients diagnosed with PTSD, who experienced acute anxiety episodes, were treated effectively by a psychiatrist [7-9]. In addition, three patients with acute anxiety symptoms under the care of pain management physicians were treated successfully [10]. In the present physician-sponsored open label study we document a trial of a compounded combination drug regarding anxiolytic efficacy and with no side effects in eight adult patients. The drug combo produced a fast-acting and beneficial calming effect in 6 of 8 patients, who were deemed as responders. None of the patients described any side effects, and there was no evidence of impairment of cognition.",

          "One can reasonably assert that this beneficial anxiolytic effect might have been enhanced even further under three study design conditions. First, if the inclusion criteria had required each patient to have a high anxiety score prior to the procedure, for instance a minimum of 7 points (with 10 as the maximum), there would have been a greater potential for a difference pre-treatment vs. during the procedure. The six responders had a baseline average of 6.3 points, so there was room for improvement. Of the six responders, two subjects had low baseline anxiety scores (i.e., patient F at 4 points and patient I at 2 points). A higher baseline inclusion parameter could have increased the differential prior to vs. during the EMG procedure. Second, there might not have been a sufficiently long waiting period between the drug administration and the procedure. One can reasonably assert that if the time interval between dosing and the procedure was increased to a minimum of 30 minutes or more (from the 10 \u2013 20 minutes), the percentage of responders and the magnitude of the response could have been greater. However, it should be noted that often in a clinic time-is-of-the-essence between the patient\u2019s initial assessment by the medical provider and the subsequent medical procedure. Some medical providers are willing to pre-treat an anxious patient, typically with an oral benzodiazepine either swallowed intact or pre-dissolved in water, and then have him/her wait (e.g., 30 + min.) for an anxiolytic effect to be acknowledged by the patient. But, some physicians and dentists might be under time constraints or might not be willing to oblige the patient this waiting period. This would not be an obstacle if either the drug has a rapid onset of effect or the patient were to pre-treat themselves immediately prior to arrival at the physician\u2019s office, for instance 30-60 minutes in advance. Even under the conditions of this study that the authors consider might have been sub-optimal, this drug combo delivered by the oral mucosal route provided a rapid onset effect as a PRN medication. This anxiolytic benefit may be useful in treating anticipatory anxiety either in-office or prior to arrival. There is a third limitation to this study to consider. The compounded medicine contained 25 mg of atenolol and 0.2 mg of scopolamine HBr.",
