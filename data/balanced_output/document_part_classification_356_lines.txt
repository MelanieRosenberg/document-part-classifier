Sexual problems after cancer treatment affect survivors of many different cancers, including breast,
bladder, colorectal, prostate, and gynecological.41-44 Issues vary greatly in severity and tend not
to be resolved unless specific treatments are provided, which may include medical therapies;
non-hormonal, water-based lubricants and moisturizers; and psychoeducational support, group therapy,
sexual counseling, marital counseling, or psychotherapy.45.
Some chemotherapy and targeted therapy drugs may cause skin problems, including redness, blistering,
itching, peeling, dryness, rashes, acne, and sensitivity to the sun.
Some targeted therapy drugs can also cause an extensive rash over the face, neck, and chest.
Most of these skin problems go away after treatment is fin- ished, but symptoms of an allergic
reaction, including sudden or severe itching, rash, or hives, should be reported right away.
Radiation may cause skin to become red, irritated, and swollen, which might worsen to become
blistered, peeling, or even open sores.
Most skin reactions to radiation slowly go away after treatment, although skin may remain darker
than it was before.
