ACGME residency, compared to the 94.40 percent U.S.  MD NRMP match rate in the same year.
Percentages of allopathic and osteopathic students who matched in specific specialties (see Table
4-3) showed that there were some important distinctions in proportions of graduates (DO vs.
U.S.  MD) going into certain fields, namely Family Medicine, Pediatrics, and Emergency Med- icine.
Despite the common misconception that highly competitive specialties are not open to DO graduates,
sig- nificant numbers of DOs enter such fields as orthopedic surgery, anesthesiology, and diagnostic
radiology.
Several limitations of this data analysis were acknowl- edged by the contributing SDN member, Jimmy
DeMeo, who is currently an osteopathic medical student at Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine
(LECOM) and the national Student Osteopathic Medical Association (SOMA) president.
For instance, the analysis did not take into con- sideration how applicants ranked specialties,
whether or not they matched into their top choice of specialty, mul- tiple match attempts,
post-match placement, or scramble results.
It also did not include results from the San Fran- cisco matching program, which is a third system
apart from the AOA and NRMP that matches applicants to a few highly competitive specialties,
including neurology, oph- thalmology, and plastic surgery.

SINCE 2001, ALL state licensing boards have accepted the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensure
Exam- ination of the United States (COMLEX-USA), which is produced by the National Board of
Osteopathic Medical Examiners (NBOME).
The United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE), produced by the National Board of Med- ical
Examiners (NMBE), is the licensing exam that all allo- pathic medical students are required to take.
Both are comprised of three tests, called “steps” by the USMLE and “levels” by the COMLEX, which
must be passed for a phy- sician to gain unlimited licensure to practice medicine in the United
States.
According to 2013 USMLE Performance Data pub- lished in the 2013 NBME Annual Report, 97 percent of
MD students (N=19,108), 94 percent of DO students (N=2,680), and 79 percent of foreign medical
students and gradu- ates (N=14,649) passed the USMLE Step 1 exam on their first attempt.
The pass rates for the USMLE Step 2 exam (from 2012-2013) showed narrowing between the groups: 98
percent (N=18,658), 96 percent (N=1,615), and 84 per- cent (N=12,203), respectively.22 The reason
only a minority of DO students elect to take the USMLE is because it is optional and not required
for their licensure.
Osteopathic medical students may elect to take the USMLE based on a variety of reasons, including
the desire to pursue an allopathic residency program.
Osteopathic medical students are unique in that they have the option to apply for osteopathic (AOA)
residency programs, allo- pathic (ACGME) residency programs, dual-accredited pro- grams, or both AOA
and ACGME programs.
However, all osteopathic students are required to take the COMLEX, regardless of whether or not they
elect to take the USMLE.
Thus, those who do take the USMLE must take both exams, which slightly differ in their length,
emphasis, and ques- tion type, although they cover similar material apart from OMM.
