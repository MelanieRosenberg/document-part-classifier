Approach           Description                  Method   of price  determination
Setting  medicine   price
Cost-based         Setting price of a           Assessment  of costs through  data collection and financial accounting. This may
pricing            medicine  based  on  the     include the following elements:
costs of inputs and add      1.   Assessing relevant costs along  a predefined scope  along  the value chain to the
to it a mark-up                   point at which the price would  be set. The data may  include direct material costs,
percentage   or amount            direct labour costs, overhead costs associated  with R&D,  manufacturing,
regulatory processes  and compliance,  communication,    storage and  distribution,
dispensing  and administration
2.   Assessing and  negotiating an  acceptable level and structure of profit margin in
addition to the costs
Value-based        Setting price of a           Comparative   assessment  of value through  health technology  assessment  or
pricing            medicine  based  on  the     appraisals. These may  include all or some of the following elements:
differentiated               1.  Assessing  comparative  health gains
worth/value  of this
2.  Assessing  comparative  cost-effectiveness
medicine patients compared for a group to of 3. Assessing affordability/financial impacts to the patient and health system
the value  of comparable     4.  Assessing  other (less quantifiable) factors, such as: severity of the medical
medicines                        condition; public health importance;  confidence  in the clinical evidence and
assessment;  equity of access; quality use of medicines; and societal value
5.  Setting a price that is commensurate   with the determination  of “value”
External           Set price according  to      1.  Select a set of comparable  countries in which the medicine  has already  been

pricing            comparable   referenced      2.  Obtain  prices from these countries
countries/organizations
3.  Determine   the price based on  criteria such as average price, lowest price, and
additional criteria (e.g. average of the four lowest prices)
Internal           Set price according  to      1.  Determine   internal benchmarks:  for example, budget  constraint, prices of

pricing            benchmark    prices          2.  Set or negotiate  price
