1.
Describing – by clearly defining what you are talking about, what specifically was involved, where
it took place and under what circumstances.
2.
Reflecting – reconsidering a topic by taking into account new information or a new experience, or
considering other viewpoints.
3.
Analyzing – examining and then explaining how something is, including comparing and contrasting
different elements and understanding relationships to your subject/topic.
4.
Critiquing – identifying and examining weaknesses in arguments, as well as acknowledging its
strengths.
It’s important to think of critiquing as ‘neutral’ and not negative.  5.
Reasoning – using methods such as cause and effect to demonstrate logical thinking, as well as
presenting evidence that either refutes or proves an argument.
6.
Evaluating – can include commenting on the degrees of success and failure of something, or the value
of something The ability to analyze and creatively adapt to new situations is at the heart of
critical thinking.
Paul and Elder (2008, 2014b) asserted that critical thinking provides a vehicle for educating the
mind.
John Dewey would agree, as from his early work, we have increased our sense of the pragmatic basis
of human thought (its instrumental nature), and especially its grounding in actual human purposes,
goals, and objectives.
Dewey (1910) also discussed critical thinking in terms of reflective thinking, which is an
uneasiness in accepting the status quo and that critical thinking is both an emotional and
intellectual component.
Students must, therefore, be taught to examine, poke, question, and reflect on what they have
learned.
Scepticism, questioning, and reflection is essential.
Dewey also stated that schools should have an intimate relationship with the community it serves.
From the review of the research concerning critical thinking and what components are considered
important in high school education and later a life-long learning skill, the authors developed a
5-step, critical thinking teaching process as outlined in Table 2.
Input from the study’s nine experts who reviewed the model and from suggestions from other model
developers, led to the selection of easy to remember letters that describe each step’s process.
Model  Letter          Description                          Supporting  Theory/Discussion
P – Step 1     Preparation for learning    (Gulicheva, Lisin, Osipova, & Khabdullin 2017; Paul et al., 1997;
