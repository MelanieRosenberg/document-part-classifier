explaining this behaviour.
Firstly, as indicated by a widely-cited study by a global consulting firm, increasing price would
generate larger improvement in profit than other levers of profit (Fig.
3.7, p.31) (150).
This may have influenced repeated price increases noted in the market for cancer medicines (147,151)
and indeed, markets for patented and generic medicines in other therapeutic areas (152–154).
Secondly, as there are many factors influencing demand of medicines other than price (50), it would
be sensible for companies focused solely on maximizing profits to focus on price because as it has
been said “price is certainty and volume is a bet”.
