Results from the tests showed that the average value of critical thinking ability to the average
achievement after the testing ended, showed the relationship was statistically significant (.05).
As a result, the researchers compared the results of Table 4 and determined that after the posttest,
data showed the average of critical thinking ability and post-learning achievement were higher than
before the study.
