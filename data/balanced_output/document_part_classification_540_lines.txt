Governments and insurers have also implemented non-price policies to ensure efficiency.
For example, some countries require treating clinicians to obtain approval prior to prescribing or
dispensing a select set of medicines, a practice known as prior authorization (216–218).
Medicines may be selected based on criteria such as evidence-based guidelines, contractual
agreements and costs.
An important consideration for implementing prior authorization is to strike a balance between the
level of administrative tasks to support such policies and timely patient access to treatment.
For example, a process review in a breast oncology practice in the USA found that prior
authorization was “complicated and labour intensive”, and had limited impact on utilization because
only 2.5% of prescriptions Non-price policies could promote efficiency.
