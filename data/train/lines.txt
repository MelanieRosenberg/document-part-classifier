Phase 1. The aim of Phase 1 was to identify the contributions of clinical and laboratory variables that in practice were the most predictive of the decision to initiate DMARD therapy in a population of patients with early undifferentiated synovitis. Initiation of DMARD therapy was used as an indicator of the physician’s opinion that the patient was at risk of developing persistent and/or erosive arthritis that we would currently consider to be RA. Data on 3,115 patients from 9 early arthritis cohorts who were consid- ered not to have evidence of another possible diagnosis explaining their presentation were obtained. Between July 2007 and November 2008 an expert working group developed an analysis strategy that related an agreed- upon list of standardized clinical and laboratory vari- ables collected at baseline to the initiation of DMARD treatment within the next 12 months. MTX initiation was used as the gold standard for this purpose. The analytical process aimed to identify the independent contribution of each variable on this list and included univariate regression modeling, a subsequent principal components analysis, and a multivariate regression model that included all identified components (25). The resulting list of informative variables identified during that process and the weights based on the odds ratios are shown in Table 1. Phase 2. Phase 2 consisted of a consensus-based, decision science–informed approach, which took place between November 2008 and June 2009. The purpose of this phase was to derive a clinician-based judgment on

In the absence of financial support from governments, the treatment costs presented in Table 4.3 would not be affordable to individual patients. For example, a course of standard (adjuvant) treatment for early stage HER2 positive breast cancer (Adjuvant AC-TH) would cost about 10 years of average annual wages in India and South Africa, and 1.7 years in the USAxx. Patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in India, South Africa and the USA would require, respectively, 3.7 years, 5.6 years and 1.1 years of wages to cover for the costs of a

Properties of insulation materials vary widely. Table 3 shows various properties of insulation materials used in brick masonry cavity walls. The thermal conductivity (k) and thermal resistance (R) provide a means of comparing the insulating properties of insulation materials. These are determined in accordance with ASTM C 177 Test Method for Steady-State Heat Flux Measurements and Thermal Transmission Properties by Means of the Guarded-Hot-Plate Apparatus measured at various temperatures. Due to the large number of types of insulation, and even larger number of manufacturers, Table 3 lists only a few representative values of physical properties. For some materials, an aged or stabilized value is given. In all cases, the aged or stabilized value is the one that should be used in design. Individual manufacturers should be consulted for design values and other properties of their specific materials and their applications.

In addition to return to learning and sporting environments, older athletes may need to return to driving, where subtle defi- cits could compromise safety. Most sports medicine physicians do not counsel athletes with SRC about driving.90 Driving is a complex process involving coordination of cognitive, visual and motor skills, as well as concentration, attention, visual percep- tion, insight and memory, which can all be affected by SRC.90 Little is known about the risk of driving after SRC, but prelim- inary data suggest some impairment exists when patients with concussion report they are asymptomatic.91 Currently, no widely

Incidentally, when you write a paper, you can expect most reviewers (and readers) to make only one pass over it. Take care to choose coherent section and sub-section titles and to write concise and comprehensive abstracts. If a reviewer cannot understand the gist after one pass, the paper will likely be rejected; if a reader cannot understand the high- lights of the paper after five minutes, the paper will likely never be read.

There are many, often complicated, mechanisms of efflorescence. Simply stated, efflorescence occurs when water containing dissolved salts is brought to the surface of masonry, the water evaporates and the salts are left on the surface of the masonry. The salt solutions may migrate across surfaces of masonry units, between the mortar and units, or through the pores of the mortar or units.

The strength and moisture penetration resistance of a brick masonry cavity wall are affected by the mortar selection and compatibility with the brick units. Portland cement-lime, mortar cement, or masonry cement mortars can be used. However, mortars with an air content less than 12 percent are recommended for their superior bond strength and resistance to moisture penetration. The MSJC Code requires that the allowable flexural tensile stresses be reduced by approximately 50 percent for assemblies constructed with masonry cement mortars or portland cement-lime mortars that have air entrainment. In addition, some building codes prohibit the use of masonry cement mortars and all Type N mortars in Seismic Performance Categories D and E (formerly Seismic Zones 3 and 4). Mortar should meet the proportion requirements of ASTM C 270 Specification for Mortar for Unit Masonry as shown in Table 1. Mortar type selection should be based on project requirements, such as strength and compatibility with a particular brick unit. Types N or S mortars are typically used in brick masonry cavity walls. See Technical Notes 8 Series for more detailed information on mortar types and selection.

Numerous alternative beta blockers are available in lieu of propranolol. Notable among these is the common drug, atenolol, that is available in oral solid dose forms ranging from 25 to 100 mg for the treatment of hypertension. Multiple doses per day may be permitted. It has been used to suppress stage fright in performers when administered orally in advance [45]. Atenolol is a beta-1 selective peripheral-acting agent without CNS effects, which should reduce the risk for asthmatic subjects [46]. Thus, atenolol might be preferred over the nonselective beta blockers for patients affected by asthma or COPD [47]. Oral atenolol at 50 - 200 mg doses suppressed heart rate by ~ 23 - 24 beats per minute (bpm) vs. ~ 10 bpm on placebo [46]. Also,
1. Decide when to clean. Mortar must harden prior to cleaning. It is generally best to schedule cleaning at least seven days after brickwork is completed. In some cases it may be possible to clean earlier; how- ever, effects on the masonry and influencing factors such as weather conditions and the type of brick and mortar should be carefully considered. Prolonged time periods between the completion of the masonry and cleaning should be avoided. After one month, mortar smears and splatters left on brickwork become increasingly difficult to remove. 2. Remove larger clumps of mortar using wooden paddles or nonmetallic tools. Metal tools may damage the brickwork or leave behind fragments that oxidize and cause rust stains. 3. Select the proper cleaning solution. There are many types of proprietary cleaners available that are for- mulated to remove specific stains or for use with a particular type of brick. Be careful to select cleaning products suitable for the brick, mortar and adjacent materials and follow the cleaner manufacturer’s rec- ommended instructions. Each product being considered should be evaluated as discussed previously in Trial Cleaning.

• Fatigue and sleepiness. Feelings of fatigue (low energy, physical tiredness, weariness) are more common than symptoms of sleepiness (actual tendency to fall asleep) in patients with chronic insomnia. The presence of significant sleepiness should prompt a search for other potential sleep disorders. The number, duration, and timing of naps should be thoroughly investigated, as both a consequence of in- somnia and a potential contributing factor.

Sleep-inducing drugs (hypnotics) are medications specif- ically designed to induce sleepiness directly after intake. Optimal agents affect cognitive performance during this period while inducing minimal sleepiness in the waking day after use. An optimal hypnotic would have low tox- icity and addictive potential, as well a minimal side effect profile (Oswald 1970). Among the first hypnotics, and an agent still in use is chloral hydrate - the original “Mickey Finn” - slipped into the drinks of unsuspecting marks for the purposes of criminal activity. Unfortu- nately, this medication is difficult to use since the LD-50 (potentially fatal dose) is quite close to the therapeutic dose. In the years leading up to the 1970’s, rapidly acting barbiturates were commonly utilized for their hypnotic effects. Unfortunately, these medications, also drugs of abuse, had a significant danger of overdose and contrib- uted to an era that was characterized in part by deaths due to overdoses of sleeping pills. These medications and similar barbiturate-like medications [Methaqualone (Quaalude, Sopor) Glutethimide (Doriden), Ethchlor- vynol (Placidyl), Methyprylon (Nodudar)] have limited availability and are rarely used due to limited efficacy, cognitive effects, the potential for abuse and lethal tox- icity associated with overdose (Oswald 1970). Today their primary therapeutic uses include executions and fa- cilitated euthanasia (Lossignol 2008). Most currently utilized hypnotics affect the widely dis- persed negative neurotransmitter GABA. In the 1970’s benzodiazepines (GABA agonists) were first marketed as hypnotics. Some of these agents had an extremely short duration of action [Triazolam (Halcion)]. While this agent-induced minimal next day somnolence, use was as- sociated with daytime memory impairment, particularly at higher dosages (Roehrs et al. 2000; Adam and Oswald

The increase in full-text downloads for open access articles during their first year after publication suggests that the primary benefit to the nonsubscriber commu- nity is in browsing, as opposed to printing or saving, which would have been indicated by a commensurate increase in PDF downloads. The decrease in abstract views suggests a reader preference for the full docu- ment when available.

O ceratocone, a degeneração marginal pelúcida e ectasia pós-cirurgia refrativa são doenças que causam afilamento e abaulamento da córnea (estrutura transparente que forma a parede anterior do globo ocular). Estas alterações provocam astigmatismo irregular com distorção visual importante. O grau de embaçamento visual vai depender do grau de astigmatismo produzido e da existência de outras alterações oculares associadas. Astigmatismo pós-transplante de córnea é um grau residual que ocorre dependendo da intera- ção entre córnea doada e receptor (coaptação, cicatrização, abertura e frouxidão de pontos no decorrer da cicatrização e sua retirada).

Properties of insulation materials vary widely. Table 3 shows various properties of insulation materials used in brick masonry cavity walls. The thermal conductivity (k) and thermal resistance (R) provide a means of comparing the insulating properties of insulation materials. These are determined in accordance with ASTM C 177 Test Method for Steady-State Heat Flux Measurements and Thermal Transmission Properties by Means of the Guarded-Hot-Plate Apparatus measured at various temperatures. Due to the large number of types of insulation, and even larger number of manufacturers, Table 3 lists only a few representative values of physical properties. For some materials, an aged or stabilized value is given. In all cases, the aged or stabilized value is the one that should be used in design. Individual manufacturers should be consulted for design values and other properties of their specific materials and their applications.

somnolence as a side effect is reproducible in susceptible individuals (White and Rumbold 1988). Sedation is a com- mon side effect of the traditional antipsychotics, with chlorpromazine and thioridazine somewhat more sedating than haloperidol. Clinical studies have shown a high inci- dence of persistent sedation with clozapine (46%) with less frequent reports of sedation with risperidone, olanzapine, sertindole and quetiapine (Monti et al. 2016). The sed- ation associated with these agents is most likely associated with their known effects on histaminic receptors. Doxepin, a sedating psychotropic agent with pro- nounced histamine (H-1) receptor antagonism exerts at least part of its effects by antagonizing orexin (Krystal et al. 2013). Suvorexant, is an orexin antagonist designed to lower waking arousal (Norman and Anderson 2016). Currently, it is being heavily marketed as a hypnotic (Rhyne and Anderson 2015). As based on performance and driving tests, this agent is known to produce a dose-related next day increase in somnolence for all age groupings tested (Farkus 2013). Sedative drug effects on daytime sleepiness are summarized in Table 4.

AASM practice parameter papers are based on evidence- based review and grading of literature, often addressing a spe- cific issue or topic. Clinical guidelines provide clinicians with a working overview for disease or disorder evaluation and man- agement. These guidelines include practice parameter papers and also include areas with limited evidence in order to provide a comprehensive practice guideline. Both practice parameters and clinical guidelines define principles of practice that should meet the needs of most patients. They should not, however, be considered exhaustive, inclusive of all available methods of care, or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably expected to obtain the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding appropriateness of any specific therapy must be made by the clinician and patient in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible

This section was meant to give you a better sense of what “osteopathic manipulative medicine” entails, and hopefully it answered most of your questions regarding OMM. The effectiveness of OMM remains a topic of ongoing debate and research despite past and current efforts to lay these arguments to rest. Whether an osteo- pathic physician uses OMM in his or her practice is based entirely on preference. With that said, it is an important core discipline and primary distinction of the osteopathic profession.

Concrete masonry units are usually used for the interior wythe of a cavity wall in combination with a brick masonry exterior. They may also be used as accent bands in the exterior brick wythe. Hollow or solid concrete masonry units should conform to ASTM C 55 Specification for Concrete Building Brick, ASTM C 90 Specification for Loadbearing Concrete Masonry Units or ASTM C 129 Specification for Non-Loadbearing Concrete Masonry Units. Non load- bearing concrete masonry units are usually specified for the interior wythe when the brick and block cavity wall is used as infill walls for concrete or steel frame structural systems if shear loads are not transmitted to that wythe.
Structural clay tile has been used as a backing material for cavity wall construction.

The inclusion of SPX Weeklys in the VIX Index calculation means that the near-term options will always have more than 23 days to expiration and the next-term options always have less than 37 days to expiration, so the resulting VIX Index value will always reflect an interpolation of σ2 1 and σ2 2 ; i.e., each individual weight is less than or equal to 1 and the sum of the weights equals 1.
The analysis found that low-income countries could spend on average up to US$ 3800 per cancer patient annually on cancer medicines for all newly-diagnosed cancer patients, and the total expenditure on these medicines would be within the generously assumed 5% of the total health expenditure (Table 4.2). In high- income countries, the analysis found that a budget threshold of 5% of the total health expenditure would allow a spending of up to US$ 40 600 on cancer medicines per patient per year, with a view to providing universal coverage.

For the (2 vs. 2) SVM schema, one can observe from Table 6 that the highest overall accuracy is 0.91 and generated by a feature combination of POS-based unigrams and K-array semantics-based sequential features, regardless of whether WordNet is used to correct the POS of a unigram or not. In terms of the kernel functions, a linear kernel is used at the first level of the SVM model and a polynomial kernel at the second level. In addition, we notice that the inclusion of bigrams (the last four rows in Table 6) does not improve accuracy but rather reduce the accuracy. This agrees with results reported in previous studies. Tables 7 and 8 present the confusion matrices resulted from the two best feature sets using the (2 vs. 2) SVM schema. These two tables elaborate the two optimal feature sets as highlighted in Table 6. Results are obtained by using a linear and a polynomial kernel at the two levels respectively and averaged over 10-fold cross validation. Notice that in certain cases, the model cannot ditinguish between positive and neutral polarities due to the reasons discussed above; while negative and no-relationship can often be correctly identified.

The goals of treatment are to “cure” the cancer, if possible; pro- long survival; and provide the highest possible quality of life during and after treatment. A cancer is cured when all traces of the cancer have been removed from the patient’s body. Although it is usually not possible to know if the cancer is completely eradicated, for many patients, the initial course of therapy is successful and the cancer never returns. However, some cancer- free survivors must cope with the long-term effects of treatment, as well as psychological concerns such as fear of recurrence. Cancer patients, caregivers, and survivors must have the infor- mation and support they need to play an active role in decisions that affect treatment and quality of life.

receptor antagonist that affects the autonomic nervous system and reduces cardiovascular symptoms (e.g., tachycardia and hypertension) resulting from epinephrine in the circulation. Beta blockers interfere with receptor binding by catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine, of which epinephrine is the principal catecholamine affecting the cardiovascular symptoms. Propranolol is a lipophilic beta blocker that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, it can affect both somatic and CNS target tissues.

Objectives of Phase 3. In Phase 3 the working group integrated the findings of the first 2 phases, refined the scoring system, and determined the optimal cut point to define “definite RA.” The goal of this final phase was to utilize the results of Phases 1 and 2 to develop a scoring system that would be applicable to newly presenting patients with undifferentiated inflam- matory arthritis to permit identification of those with a high probability of developing persistent and/or erosive RA. Being intended for use with newly presenting patients, the scoring system should be robust enough that it could be applied repeatedly during the early course of disease, such that a patient identified as not classifiable as having definite RA at initial presentation might be classified as having definite RA at a subsequent time point. The work was not aimed at classifying subjects with established disease, either active or inac- tive. However, the working group recognized that pa- tients may present for the first time with disease that is at a later stage and being treated. Thus, although it was not the explicit charge of the working group to provide

Sport-specific rules may not allow adequate time for evaluation, and modifying these rules remains an area for improvement within the governing bodies of some sports. (C) When the sports medicine clinician becomes aware of a poten- tial injury, the athlete is approached and a brief history of the event is obtained from the athlete and those who witnessed the event or athlete behaviour. How the athlete responds to the elements of orientation, memory, concentration and balance is evaluated, as well as speech patterns and how the athlete appears to be processing information.

The use of two antimalarials simultaneously, especially when the antimalarials have different mechanisms of action, has the potential for inhib- iting the development of resistance to either of the components. The efficacy of a combination of a 4-aminoquinoline drug (either chloroquine or amo- diaquine) with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine has been reviewed (43). The results of this review sug- gested that the addition of either chloroquine or amodiaquine to SP marginally improved parasitological clearance (compared with SP alone). The studies reviewed were mostly done in areas and at times when both SP and chloroquine/amodi- aquine retained a fair amount of efficacy, and it is not clear from these studies how well such a combination would act in areas where one of the components was significantly compromised. Additionally, to date, there are no data to suggest whether this slightly improved clearance would
Results from the tests showed that the average value of critical thinking ability to the average achievement after the testing ended, showed the relationship was statistically significant (.05). As a result, the researchers compared the results of Table 4 and determined that after the posttest, data showed the average of critical thinking ability and post-learning achievement were higher than before the study.

6. Identify the efflorescence. Knowing the composition of efflorescing salts is sometimes of use. Table 1, taken from Brownell’s report lists the most probable sources of efflorescing salts. Commercial testing laboratories can use X-ray diffraction, petrographic analysis or chemical analysis can, in some instances, determine both the type of salts present and their relative quantity. 7. Consider miscellaneous sources of water when all obvious sources have been eliminated. Some of these sources are: condensation within the wall, poorly directed landscape sprinklers, leaky pipes, faulty drains and condensation on heating or plumbing pipes. If necessary, condensation analysis methods are described in Technical Note 47.

There are debates about whether the returns generated from the sales of medicines, including cancer medicines, are sufficient for pharmaceutical companies to cover their past R&amp;D expenses, maintain their operations and engage in future drug discovery research. For example, some commentators have observed that the revenue generated from the sales of imatinib had exceeded the costs of R&amp;D within two years and “the revenues over the subsequent years of the patent would represent generous profits to the company” (30). Another study found that total revenue from the sales of 10 cancer medicines since approval over a median of four years (US$ 67.0 billion) was 9.3 times the total R&amp;D spending of US$ 7.2 billion (or 7.4 times using an estimated risk-adjusted R&amp;D costs of US$ 9.1 billion) (94).

Composite or combination flashings are typically less expensive than sheet metal and are easier to install. The most predominant type is a thin layer of metal sandwiched between one or two layers of another material. The metal layer is usually of aluminum, copper or lead. It is covered on one or both sides with various materials, such as asphalt coatings, kraft paper, fiberglass fabric or plastic films. Product literature should be reviewed to determine whether these materials are appropriate for use in brick masonry cavity walls. Consideration should be given to compatibility with adjacent sealants, delamination due to moisture penetration and movement of the wall system.

For newer targeted cancer medicines, there are two additional areas of uncertainty. Firstly, despite their established mechanisms of action, targeted cancer medicines may not have clinically-meaningful activities against all tumours with a matching genetic mutation. To this point, a clinical trial has found that the progression-free survival of patients with metastatic solid tumour refractory to standard of care did not improve with the use of targeted therapies that matched with the tumour’s molecular profile but outside their approved indications, compared to patients who received treatment at the choice of their treating physicians (79). This means that targeted therapies should only be used according to approved indications and not based on identified molecular alternations or the general type of cancer.

Brick has been used to create beautiful buildings for centuries. Most of these structures have a substantial history of outstanding performance. In some instances the appearance is affected by the development of efflorescence or stains. These may originate from materials in the brick or mortar, from adjacent materials, and from outside sourc- es such as cleaning agents. Each has a particular chemical composition and a unique means of removal.

President Obama has recently expressed a strong conviction that “Science offers great potential for improving health”. The President has announced a research initiative that aims to accelerate progress toward a new era of precision medicine. The time is accurate for this idealistic initiative, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other partners will work to attain this vision [7]. The concept of precision medicine speaks of prevention and treatment strategies that take individual variability into account. Even though it is not new, the impact of practicality is still deprived. If one considers blood typing, for instance, has been used to guide blood transfusions for more than a century. But the vision of applying this concept broadly has been intensely improved by the latest development of large-scale biologic databases (such as the human genome sequence), powerful methods for typifying patients (such as proteomics, metabolomics, genomics, diverse cellular assays, and even mobile health technology), and computational tools for analyzing large sets of data. Francis S.Collins et al. stated that, “What is necessary now is a broad

For newer targeted cancer medicines, there are two additional areas of uncertainty. Firstly, despite their established mechanisms of action, targeted cancer medicines may not have clinically-meaningful activities against all tumours with a matching genetic mutation. To this point, a clinical trial has found that the progression-free survival of patients with metastatic solid tumour refractory to standard of care did not improve with the use of targeted therapies that matched with the tumour’s molecular profile but outside their approved indications, compared to patients who received treatment at the choice of their treating physicians (79). This means that targeted therapies should only be used according to approved indications and not based on identified molecular alternations or the general type of cancer.
In the future, we would also like to increase the size of our con(cid:3)ated dataset and possibly create a biomedical all-words disambiguation test set to test our approach. Unlike SenseClusters, our approach can be used to perform all-words disambiguation. For example, given the sentence: His weight has fluctuated during the past month. We (cid:2)rst create a instance vector containing fluctuated, past and months for the word weight and a concept vector for each of its possible concepts, (cid:147)C0005912: Body Weight(cid:148) and (cid:147)C0699807: Quantitative Concept(cid:148) us- ing their context descriptions. We then calculate the cosine between the instance vector and each of the two concept vectors. The concept whose vector has the smallest cosine score is assigned to weight. We then repeat this process for fluctuated, past and months. We also plan to explore using different contex- tual information to improve the accuracy of our approach. We are currently exploring using co- occurrence and relational information about the pos- sible CUIs in the UMLS. Our IDF stoplist exper-
The analysis found that low-income countries could spend on average up to US$ 3800 per cancer patient annually on cancer medicines for all newly-diagnosed cancer patients, and the total expenditure on these medicines would be within the generously assumed 5% of the total health expenditure (Table 4.2). In high- income countries, the analysis found that a budget threshold of 5% of the total health expenditure would allow a spending of up to US$ 40 600 on cancer medicines per patient per year, with a view to providing universal coverage.

Results from the tests showed that the average value of critical thinking ability to the average achievement after the testing ended, showed the relationship was statistically significant (.05). As a result, the researchers compared the results of Table 4 and determined that after the posttest, data showed the average of critical thinking ability and post-learning achievement were higher than before the study.

We report the results for four experiments in this pa- per: i) the results of using the IDF stoplist over a ba- sic stoplist, ii) the results of our approach using dif- ferent context descriptions of the possible concepts of a target word, iii) the results of our approach com- pared to SenseClusters and Humphrey et al. (2006) using the NLM-WSD dataset, and iv) the results of our approach compared to SenseClusters using the con(cid:3)ated dataset. The results of using an individualized IDF stoplist for each target word show an improvement over us- ing the basic stoplist. The results of our approach using different context descriptions show that for the NLM-WSD dataset the large differences in accuracy makes it unclear which of the context descriptions performed the best. On the con(cid:3)ated dataset, adding the ST de(cid:2)nition to the context description improved

Canada has a national stopgap to protect consumers from price gouging. The Patient Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB), a consumer protection agency, has the authority to impose sanctions and price reductions for patented products deemed excessively priced. However, the PMPRB is hobbled in its ability to keep Canada’s drug spending low.

Your child has been identified as needing services for English Language Learners (ELL). Your child will be placed in the ESL/Bilingual Education dual language immersion program, as outlined in the attached document. We believe that this program will help meet your child’s educational needs and enhance his/her academic success in school. Your child will be assessed twice yearly, or as needed, to determine progress toward individual ELL goals. When your child scores in the acceptable range (4.5 Literacy/5.0 Overall) on all areas of the W-APT or ACCESS assessment they will be exited from the program. If your student currently has an Individualized Education Program (IEP), their needs will continue to be met through their current accommodations.

prices of pharmaceuticals grew faster than the collective prices of all goods and services (Fig. 4.6a, p.61). However, the trends in the two countries began to diverge in the late 1980s where the price level of medicines continued to rise faster in the USA, while the growth rate of pharmaceutical prices in Australia seemed to have been stabilized at around 10% higher than the consumer price index. This could possibly be due to the introduction of “cost effectiveness” as a requirement before listing a medicine on the national pharmaceutical insurance scheme, so as to ensure the benefits of a given medicine were high enough to justify the price requested by the manufacturer (246). The divergence became more prominent when the Australian Government undertook further reforms of its national scheme after 2005 (247), which was implemented in response to a report that warned “in 40 years’ time, the PBS could account for 3.4% of GDP, making it the largest part of the Government’s spending on health” (248). The reforms seem to have resulted in gradual normalization of the growth rate of medicine prices in Australia to a level in line with the overall inflation rate of other consumer goods (Fig. 4.6a). In contrast, medicine prices continued to grow considerably in the USA, with the cumulative growth reaching 2.4 times the overall inflation rate of other consumer goods in 2017. Of note, the price level of prescription medicines in the USA rose in parallel with Pricing and reimbursement policies in Australia over four decades have controlled the growth rate of medicine prices.

Dose ranging test: Here, compounds are tested at a minimum of 4 different doses (the “dose ranging, full 4-day test”, typically 100, 30, 10 and 3 mg/kg, by both s.c. and p.o. routes of administration). ED 50 and ED 90 values are calculated by plotting the log dose against probit activity (for example, using Microcal “Origin”). These reflect the drug concentrations at which 50% and 90% of suppression of parasitemia is achieved. Note that with short half-life drugs it may be necessary to dose multiple times per day. Two other parameters measured in this study are relative potency compared to an appropriate standard drug, and oral bioavailability (assessed by comparison of oral and parenteral administration).

somnolence as a side effect is reproducible in susceptible individuals (White and Rumbold 1988). Sedation is a com- mon side effect of the traditional antipsychotics, with chlorpromazine and thioridazine somewhat more sedating than haloperidol. Clinical studies have shown a high inci- dence of persistent sedation with clozapine (46%) with less frequent reports of sedation with risperidone, olanzapine, sertindole and quetiapine (Monti et al. 2016). The sed- ation associated with these agents is most likely associated with their known effects on histaminic receptors. Doxepin, a sedating psychotropic agent with pro- nounced histamine (H-1) receptor antagonism exerts at least part of its effects by antagonizing orexin (Krystal et al. 2013). Suvorexant, is an orexin antagonist designed to lower waking arousal (Norman and Anderson 2016). Currently, it is being heavily marketed as a hypnotic (Rhyne and Anderson 2015). As based on performance and driving tests, this agent is known to produce a dose-related next day increase in somnolence for all age groupings tested (Farkus 2013). Sedative drug effects on daytime sleepiness are summarized in Table 4.

When analyzing the data, we found that there does not exist a CUI de(cid:2)nition for a large number of pos- sible concepts. Table 5 shows the number of words in the CUI and ST de(cid:2)nitions for each concept in the NLM-WSD dataset. Only four target words have a CUI de(cid:2)nition for each possible concept. We also found the concept de(cid:2)nitions vary widely in length. The CUI de(cid:2)nitions in the UMLS come from a va- riety of sources and there may exist more than one de(cid:2)nition per source. Unlike CUI de(cid:2)nitions, there does exist an ST de(cid:2)nition for each possible con- cept. The ST de(cid:2)nitions come from the same source and are approximately the same length but they are a broad categorization. We believe this makes them too coarse grained to provide descriptive enough in- formation about their associated concepts.

• Mood disturbances and cognitive difficulties. Complaints of irritability, loss of interest, mild depression and anxi- ety are common among insomnia patients. Patients with chronic insomnia often complain of mental inefficiency, difficulty remembering, difficulty focusing attention, and difficulty with complex mental tasks. • Quality of life: The irritability and fatigue associated with insomnia may cause interpersonal difficulties for insomnia patients, or avoidance of such activities. Conversely, in- terpersonal difficulties may be an important contributor to insomnia problems for some individuals. Sleep and wak- ing problems may lead to restriction of daytime activities, including social events, exercise, or work. Lack of regular daytime activities and exercise may in turn contribute to insomnia. • Exacerbation of comorbid conditions. Comorbid condi- tions may cause or increase sleep difficulties. Likewise, poor sleep may exacerbate symptomatology of comorbid conditions. Sleep complaints may herald the onset of mood disorders or exacerbation of comorbid conditions. VI. Other History: A complete insomnia history also in- cludes medical, psychiatric, medication/substance, and family/ social/occupational histories. A wide range of medical (Table 5) and psychiatric (Table 6) conditions can be comorbid with

Sport-specific rules may not allow adequate time for evaluation, and modifying these rules remains an area for improvement within the governing bodies of some sports. (C) When the sports medicine clinician becomes aware of a poten- tial injury, the athlete is approached and a brief history of the event is obtained from the athlete and those who witnessed the event or athlete behaviour. How the athlete responds to the elements of orientation, memory, concentration and balance is evaluated, as well as speech patterns and how the athlete appears to be processing information. Cervical palpation and range of motion (ROM) are also typically performed to assess for other

The strength and moisture penetration resistance of a brick masonry cavity wall are affected by the mortar selection and compatibility with the brick units. Portland cement-lime, mortar cement, or masonry cement mortars can be used. However, mortars with an air content less than 12 percent are recommended for their superior bond strength and resistance to moisture penetration. The MSJC Code requires that the allowable flexural tensile stresses be reduced by approximately 50 percent for assemblies constructed with masonry cement mortars or portland cement-lime mortars that have air entrainment. In addition, some building codes prohibit the use of masonry cement mortars and all Type N mortars in Seismic Performance Categories D and E (formerly Seismic Zones 3 and 4). Mortar should meet the proportion requirements of ASTM C 270 Specification for Mortar for Unit Masonry as shown in Table 1. Mortar type selection should be based on project requirements, such as strength and compatibility with a particular brick unit. Types N or S mortars are typically used in brick masonry cavity walls. See Technical Notes 8 Series for more detailed information on mortar types and selection.

Medical misdiagnosis, in the form of inaccurate, late, and delayed diagnoses, is an ongoing problem in the U.S. Not only do these diagnostic errors present an ongoing risk to the health and safety of patients, but they also cost the economy billions of dollars.

Profit control is an effective measure to manage medicine prices insofar as the regulators have control over the supply of medicines at certain points along the supply chain. Typically, this means that the regulator needs to have full visibility of the supply and distribution chains. The regulator also needs to have the capacity and ability to enforce non-compliance. Profit control is most effective when there is a publicly- funded universal programme for the provision of medicines. In contrast, it may be much less effective in health care settings where the private sector plays a significant role in the delivery of medicines, or where the structure of supply chain is complex or under-developed (183).

Results from the tests showed that the average value of critical thinking ability to the average achievement after the testing ended, showed the relationship was statistically significant (.05). As a result, the researchers compared the results of Table 4 and determined that after the posttest, data showed the average of critical thinking ability and post-learning achievement were higher than before the study.

Although, it was assumed that the 'thicker' articles with wider range of vocabulary is preferable in the editors hands, the editors (and probably the readers) prefer simple, clear and coherent writing, rather than a fancy or complex, pseudo-scientific style. Also Funkhouser and Maccoby (1971) showed that the information gain is especially enhanced by the “use of examples", i.e. it helps a lot to use some non-science material, such as everyday life parallels, historical points, etc. On the other hand, some sections, such as Introduction and Discussion, have to intrigue readers and attract interest and should therefore not be over-simplified. For example, a mysterious title can catch readers' attention and will be easily remembered (e.g.: T.Y. Li and J. Yorke named their famous paper on chaos: "The period three means chaos"). Some sections require more skill and are more important. It is approximated that from all published journal RAs in the world, only less than 5% are read in detail. However, more than 50% of abstracts are read and so the quality of an abstracts is much more important (Gordon, 1983). Therefore, the abstract should present the 'story' of the RA in miniature and should be readable standalone.

1. Describing – by clearly defining what you are talking about, what specifically was involved, where it took place and under what circumstances. 2. Reflecting – reconsidering a topic by taking into account new information or a new experience, or considering other viewpoints. 3. Analyzing – examining and then explaining how something is, including comparing and contrasting different elements and understanding relationships to your subject/topic. 4. Critiquing – identifying and examining weaknesses in arguments, as well as acknowledging its strengths. It’s important to think of critiquing as ‘neutral’ and not negative. 5. Reasoning – using methods such as cause and effect to demonstrate logical thinking, as well as presenting evidence that either refutes or proves an argument.

istic option. Clinical diagnosis offers the advantages of ease, speed, and low cost. In areas where malaria is prevalent, clinical diagnosis usually results in all patients with fever and no apparent other cause being treated for malaria. This approach can iden- tify most patients who truly need antimalarial treat- ment, but it is also likely to misclassify many who do not (15). Over-diagnosis can be considerable and contributes to misuse of antimalarial drugs. Considerable overlap exists between the signs and

Osteopathic medical schools also use differing cri- teria when selecting candidates to interview and/or extending offers of admission. For example, in the eval- uation of applicants, osteopathic medical schools place more emphasis on candidates’ interest in and knowledge of osteopathic philosophy. They also are more likely to seek out students who are interested in pursuing careers in primary care and in rural or underserved areas.3 Osteo- pathic admissions programs often view the candidate as a

These assignment guidelines pertain exclusively to Commercial Mobile Radio Service providers (CMRS). The IMSI Administrator directly administers only the Home Network Identity (HNI) segment of the resource. The HNI uniquely identifies the home wireless network of a FCC- licensed two-way CMRS subscriber and contains the Mobile Country Code (MCC) and the Mobile Network Code (MNC). The remaining segment of the IMSI, the Mobile Station Identification Number (MSIN), is directly administered by the wireless network licensee to which the HNI is assigned. Issue: In 1998, ITU Recommendation E.212 was modified allowing IMSI assignments to those Wireline Service Providers offering limited mobility services. As a result, HNI assignments are no longer available exclusively to CMRS providers. The current IMSI assignment and administrative guidelines do not however reflect these modifications.

I understand that this Direct Rollover to the Florida Retirement System (FRS) is for the express purpose of purchasing service credit under the FRS. Furthermore, I understand that I will not earn interest on my personal contributions (including these rollover funds) in the FRS. I certify that I am not rolling over any of my required minimum distribution amount from my current account. I understand that to avoid the interest, this payment must be received by the FRS no later than June 30.
The naïve interpretation of this is that no more than 13 candidate compounds would be needed for a reasonable chance of launching one new medicine, and 25 for a com- bination with two NCEs (new chemical entities). How- ever, if one aims for a 90% overall chance of success (P), the number of candidates n, each with a success probabil- ity s (8%) is described by the negative binomial distribu- tion in Eq. 1.

samples)) / (geometric mean cpm of no drug samples). Percentage reductions are used to plot percentage inhibition of growth as a function of drug concentrations. IC 50 values are determined by linear regression analyses on the linear segments of the curves (IC 90 values can also be determined by curve-fitting and can provide an useful measure of variation between experiments). Assays are typically repeated on two or three separate occasions. Within each experiment, standard deviations are typically less than 10% of the mean. Differences in parasite stages of development can lead to up to two-fold shifts in the IC 50 values between experiments; however, these differences rarely affect the overall relationships between the parasite lines in terms of their differences in drug response 4-11 .
Return-to-sport progressions should be individualised based on the injury, athlete’s age, history and level of play, and the ability to provide close supervision during the return to activity, and progressions may vary between athletes. Each stage is generally 24 hours without return of concussion symptoms. Consider written clearance from a healthcare professional before return to sport as directed by local laws and regulations.3

of the weakest links in the system. A study in Malawi revealed that the condition of many seriously ill children arriving at clinicshadnotpreviouslybeenrecognized.Insteadofreceiving immediate emergency care they were kept waiting for long periods before being given proper treatment. This resulted in avoidable deaths and disability (28). In Mexico, verbal autopsies of 132 children who died revealed that the majority had been seen by a physician within three days of death. Poor selection of medications and late referral to tertiary care were judged to be important contributory factors in more than half the deaths (29). A qualitative study of 21 hospitals in seven developing countries found that poor triage of incoming patients and inadequate provision of emergency care jeopar- dized the lives of arriving patients (30). Fourteen of the facilities (including 10 of 13 district hospitals) did not have an adequate triage system. A comprehensive review of the management of 131 children treated at these facilities found evidenceofinappropriateordelayedtriagein8%ofcases,poor clinical assessments in 41%, and potentially harmful delays in treatment in 19%. Several international health projects aimed at improving initial triage and treatment have been instituted at district health care facilities. Most focus on the strengthening of maternal and child health. One such project produced guidelines for emergency triage and treatment (28). An evaluation of these guidelines demonstrated that they significantly decreased the time required to assess children in need of urgent medical attention (31). In Sierra Leone a health care facility was upgraded in order to enhance its ability to provide prompt medical and surgicaltreatmenttowomenwithcomplicationsofpregnancy. The annual number of obstetric procedures rose from 2 to 38 over a period of five years. During the same period the

The structural design of cavity walls should follow either rational or empirical methods. The rational design method is based on the properties of the wall materials and engineering analysis. This method may be used for any structure where high loads are likely or where tall walls are a necessity. The empirical method is generally satisfactory for one and two-story buildings consisting of light construction with limited floor spans and wall heights; and for multistory buildings where unsupported wall heights are not excessive.

The key idea is that you should read the paper in up to three passes, instead of starting at the beginning and plow- ing your way to the end. Each pass accomplishes specific goals and builds upon the previous pass: The first pass gives you a general idea about the paper. The second pass lets you grasp the paper’s content, but not its details. The third pass helps you understand the paper in depth.

6. Evaluating – can include commenting on the degrees of success and failure of something, or the value of something The ability to analyze and creatively adapt to new situations is at the heart of critical thinking. Paul and Elder (2008, 2014b) asserted that critical thinking provides a vehicle for educating the mind. John Dewey would agree, as from his early work, we have increased our sense of the pragmatic basis of human thought (its instrumental nature), and especially its grounding in actual human purposes, goals, and objectives. Dewey (1910) also discussed critical thinking in terms of reflective thinking, which is an uneasiness in accepting the status quo and that critical thinking is both an emotional and intellectual component. Students must, therefore, be taught to examine, poke, question, and reflect on what they have learned. Scepticism, questioning, and reflection is essential. Dewey also stated that schools should have an intimate relationship with the community it serves. From the review of the research concerning critical thinking and what components are considered important in high school education and later a life-long learning skill, the authors developed a 5-step, critical thinking teaching process as outlined in Table 2. Input from the study’s nine experts who reviewed the model and from suggestions from other model developers, led to the selection of easy to remember letters that describe each step’s process.

medicine (NMM) and OMM obtain many more hundreds of hours of manual medicine training in a wider variety of clinical settings than DCs and other DOs. This section was meant to give you a better sense of what “osteopathic manipulative medicine” entails, and hopefully it answered most of your questions regarding OMM. The effectiveness of OMM remains a topic of ongoing debate and research despite past and current efforts to lay these arguments to rest. Whether an osteo- pathic physician uses OMM in his or her practice is based entirely on preference. With that said, it is an important core discipline and primary distinction of the osteopathic profession.

Although, it was assumed that the 'thicker' articles with wider range of vocabulary is preferable in the editors hands, the editors (and probably the readers) prefer simple, clear and coherent writing, rather than a fancy or complex, pseudo-scientific style. Also Funkhouser and Maccoby (1971) showed that the information gain is especially enhanced by the “use of examples", i.e. it helps a lot to use some non-science material, such as everyday life parallels, historical points, etc. On the other hand, some sections, such as Introduction and Discussion, have to intrigue readers and attract interest and should therefore not be over-simplified. For example, a mysterious title can catch readers' attention and will be easily remembered (e.g.: T.Y. Li and J. Yorke named their famous paper on chaos: "The period three means chaos"). Some sections require more skill and are more important. It is approximated that from all published journal RAs in the world, only less than 5% are read in detail. However, more than 50% of abstracts are read and so the quality of an abstracts is much more important (Gordon, 1983). Therefore, the abstract should present the 'story' of the RA in miniature and should be readable standalone.

Insomnia occurs in individuals of all ages and races, and has been observed across all cultures and countries.8,9 The actual prevalence of insomnia varies according to the stringency of the definition used. Insomnia symptoms occur in approximately 33% to 50% of the adult population; insomnia symptoms with dis- tress or impairment (i.e., general insomnia disorder) in 10% to 15%; and specific insomnia disorders in 5% to 10%.10 Consis- tent risk factors for insomnia include increasing age, female sex, comorbid (medical, psychiatric, sleep, and substance use) disor- ders, shift work, and possibly unemployment and lower socio- economic status. Patients with comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions are at particularly increased risk, with psychiatric and chronic pain disorders having insomnia rates as high as 50% to 75%.11-13 The risk relationship between insomnia and psychiatric disorders appears to be bidirectional; several studies have also

The analysis found that low-income countries could spend on average up to US$ 3800 per cancer patient annually on cancer medicines for all newly-diagnosed cancer patients, and the total expenditure on these medicines would be within the generously assumed 5% of the total health expenditure (Table 4.2). In high- income countries, the analysis found that a budget threshold of 5% of the total health expenditure would allow a spending of up to US$ 40 600 on cancer medicines per patient per year, with a view to providing universal coverage.

Wind turbines will be used to harness the kinetic energy of the moving air over the oceans on the OCS and convert it to electricity. Offshore winds are less turbulent (because the ocean is flat relative to onshore topography), and they tend to flow at higher speeds than onshore winds, thus allowing turbines to produce more electricity. Because the potential energy produced from the wind is directly proportional to the cube of the wind speed, increased wind speeds of only a few miles per hour can produce a significantly larger amount of electricity. For instance, a turbine at a site with an average wind speed of 16 mph would produce 50% more electricity than at a site with the same turbine and average wind speeds of 14 mph (Offshore Wind 2006).

OOP costs in the year of diagnosis came mostly from professional and non-inpatient facility services. Figure 8 shows the level of OOP costs by percentile for all study cancers combined. In general, patient cost-sharing is higher for out-of-network services than in-network. Not surprisingly, cancer patients in the highest decile of OOP spending also incurred the highest portion of OOP costs for out- of-network providers; conversely, patients in the lowest decile incurred the lowest portion of OOP costs for out-of-network providers.

During data extraction, interventions/exposures will be labelled using the exposure codes listed in the Guidelines for the search literature reviews of the 2007 WCRF/AICR expert Report1 . The interventions/exposures are allocated under the main headings and subheadings listed in Appendix 4. For example, diet modifications –e.g. diets rich in fruit and vegetables and low in fats- will be coded under “Dietary patterns” and combinations of micronutrients in supplements will be coded under “Dietary Constituents”.
For newer targeted cancer medicines, there are two additional areas of uncertainty. Firstly, despite their established mechanisms of action, targeted cancer medicines may not have clinically-meaningful activities against all tumours with a matching genetic mutation. To this point, a clinical trial has found that the progression-free survival of patients with metastatic solid tumour refractory to standard of care did not improve with the use of targeted therapies that matched with the tumour’s molecular profile but outside their approved indications, compared to patients who received treatment at the choice of their treating physicians (79). This means that targeted therapies should only be used according to approved indications and not based on identified molecular alternations or the general type of cancer.

We used an expert provided list of 42 relevant domain terms for the Myocardial Perfusion Imaging domain (a sub-domain of nuclear cardiology) to heuristically test the coverage of our ontology terms. Of these, we found 31 exactly matching terms, 2 morphological variants and 8 phrases that contained the terms from the expert list. Out of this 42 domain terms, 1 term, ‘dyperidamole’, was not found in our ontology (dyperidamole is a drug given during pregnancy). We found that this term didn’t exist in the 618 JNC abstracts we were using. Instead, another term, diperidamole (spelling variant) existed in our term list. To do away with noise in our data, we selected terms with greater than average frequency (2.9) of the 10191 retrieved terms and set that as our threshold. We pruned the list to

of the weakest links in the system. A study in Malawi revealed that the condition of many seriously ill children arriving at clinicshadnotpreviouslybeenrecognized.Insteadofreceiving immediate emergency care they were kept waiting for long periods before being given proper treatment. This resulted in avoidable deaths and disability (28). In Mexico, verbal autopsies of 132 children who died revealed that the majority had been seen by a physician within three days of death. Poor selection of medications and late referral to tertiary care were judged to be important contributory factors in more than half the deaths (29). A qualitative study of 21 hospitals in seven developing countries found that poor triage of incoming patients and inadequate provision of emergency care jeopar- dized the lives of arriving patients (30). Fourteen of the facilities (including 10 of 13 district hospitals) did not have an adequate triage system. A comprehensive review of the management of 131 children treated at these facilities found evidenceofinappropriateordelayedtriagein8%ofcases,poor clinical assessments in 41%, and potentially harmful delays in treatment in 19%. Several international health projects aimed at improving initial triage and treatment have been instituted at district health care facilities. Most focus on the strengthening of maternal and child health. One such project produced guidelines for emergency triage and treatment (28). An evaluation of these guidelines demonstrated that they significantly decreased the time required to assess children in need of urgent medical attention (31). In Sierra Leone a health care facility was upgraded in order to enhance its ability to provide prompt medical and surgicaltreatmenttowomenwithcomplicationsofpregnancy. The annual number of obstetric procedures rose from 2 to 38 over a period of five years. During the same period the

Insomnia occurs in individuals of all ages and races, and has been observed across all cultures and countries.8,9 The actual prevalence of insomnia varies according to the stringency of the definition used. Insomnia symptoms occur in approximately 33% to 50% of the adult population; insomnia symptoms with dis- tress or impairment (i.e., general insomnia disorder) in 10% to 15%; and specific insomnia disorders in 5% to 10%.10 Consis- tent risk factors for insomnia include increasing age, female sex, comorbid (medical, psychiatric, sleep, and substance use) disor- ders, shift work, and possibly unemployment and lower socio- economic status. Patients with comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions are at particularly increased risk, with psychiatric and chronic pain disorders having insomnia rates as high as 50% to 75%.11-13 The risk relationship between insomnia and psychiatric disorders appears to be bidirectional; several studies have also

President Obama has recently expressed a strong conviction that “Science offers great potential for improving health”. The President has announced a research initiative that aims to accelerate progress toward a new era of precision medicine. The time is accurate for this idealistic initiative, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other partners will work to attain this vision [7]. The concept of precision medicine speaks of prevention and treatment strategies that take individual variability into account. Even though it is not new, the impact of practicality is still deprived. If one considers blood typing, for instance, has been used to guide blood transfusions for more than a century. But the vision of applying this concept broadly has been intensely improved by the latest development of large-scale biologic databases (such as the human genome sequence), powerful methods for typifying patients (such as proteomics, metabolomics, genomics, diverse cellular assays, and even mobile health technology), and computational tools for analyzing large sets of data. Francis S.Collins et al. stated that, “What is necessary now is a broad

a physician intentionally stimulates a physiologic response by CO 2 inhalation [31], sodium lactate infusion [32,33], or cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4) injection [32,34]. These chemical exposures are used as potent tools to design controlled studies with predictable levels of PA episodes. In a study with healthy volunteer subjects using carbon dioxide inhalation to provoke panic and anxiety, propranolol significantly decreased heart rate, a cardiovascular somatic symptom, but did not provide psychic anxiolytic benefit [35].
Concrete masonry units are usually used for the interior wythe of a cavity wall in combination with a brick masonry exterior. They may also be used as accent bands in the exterior brick wythe. Hollow or solid concrete masonry units should conform to ASTM C 55 Specification for Concrete Building Brick, ASTM C 90 Specification for Loadbearing Concrete Masonry Units or ASTM C 129 Specification for Non-Loadbearing Concrete Masonry Units. Non load- bearing concrete masonry units are usually specified for the interior wythe when the brick and block cavity wall is used as infill walls for concrete or steel frame structural systems if shear loads are not transmitted to that wythe.

For newer targeted cancer medicines, there are two additional areas of uncertainty. Firstly, despite their established mechanisms of action, targeted cancer medicines may not have clinically-meaningful activities against all tumours with a matching genetic mutation. To this point, a clinical trial has found that the progression-free survival of patients with metastatic solid tumour refractory to standard of care did not improve with the use of targeted therapies that matched with the tumour’s molecular profile but outside their approved indications, compared to patients who received treatment at the choice of their treating physicians (79). This means that targeted therapies should only be used according to approved indications and not based on identified molecular alternations or the general type of cancer.

1. Decide when to clean. Mortar must harden prior to cleaning. It is generally best to schedule cleaning at least seven days after brickwork is completed. In some cases it may be possible to clean earlier; how- ever, effects on the masonry and influencing factors such as weather conditions and the type of brick and mortar should be carefully considered. Prolonged time periods between the completion of the masonry and cleaning should be avoided. After one month, mortar smears and splatters left on brickwork become increasingly difficult to remove. 2. Remove larger clumps of mortar using wooden paddles or nonmetallic tools. Metal tools may damage the brickwork or leave behind fragments that oxidize and cause rust stains. 3. Select the proper cleaning solution. There are many types of proprietary cleaners available that are for- mulated to remove specific stains or for use with a particular type of brick. Be careful to select cleaning products suitable for the brick, mortar and adjacent materials and follow the cleaner manufacturer’s rec- ommended instructions. Each product being considered should be evaluated as discussed previously in Trial Cleaning.

In the late 1800s, Andrew Taylor Still identified the neuromusculoskeletal system as the key element in health maintenance and stressed preventive aspects of medi- cine in place of drug therapy. During that time, osteop- athy was truly separate and distinct from the world of allo- pathic medicine. Since then, as medicine in general has become more evidence-based and supported by research, osteopathic philosophy has evolved into a more complete and robust osteopathic medicine. The phrase “osteopathic medicine” is now the accepted term for the profession over “osteopathy,” a now-antiquated term that represents a period when Still championed a near-drugless form of manual medicine. Since its conception, osteopathic med- icine has adapted its body of knowledge to incorporate contemporary scientific thought, including germ theory, pharmacology, and other “allopathic” teachings. The cen- tral tenets of osteopathic thought, however, have been maintained and continue to guide DOs in their practice of medicine. Though interprofessional relations between MDs and DOs are better than they have ever been before, challenges still exist in terms of keeping the osteopathic tradition intact, improving the evidence basis of OMM via clinical research, and advocating for widespread recogni- tion of DOs.
concussion tests. If it is clear an athlete has an SRC, additional sideline testing can be discontinued. Sport-specific rules may not allow adequate time for evaluation, and modifying these rules remains an area for improvement within the governing bodies of some sports. (C) When the sports medicine clinician becomes aware of a poten- tial injury, the athlete is approached and a brief history of the event is obtained from the athlete and those who witnessed the event or athlete behaviour. How the athlete responds to the elements of orientation, memory, concentration and balance is evaluated, as well as speech patterns and how the athlete appears to be processing information. Cervical palpation and range of motion (ROM) are also typically performed to assess for other

medicine (NMM) and OMM obtain many more hundreds of hours of manual medicine training in a wider variety of clinical settings than DCs and other DOs. This section was meant to give you a better sense of what “osteopathic manipulative medicine” entails, and hopefully it answered most of your questions regarding OMM. The effectiveness of OMM remains a topic of ongoing debate and research despite past and current efforts to lay these arguments to rest. Whether an osteo- pathic physician uses OMM in his or her practice is based entirely on preference. With that said, it is an important core discipline and primary distinction of the osteopathic profession.

We report the results for four experiments in this pa- per: i) the results of using the IDF stoplist over a ba- sic stoplist, ii) the results of our approach using dif- ferent context descriptions of the possible concepts of a target word, iii) the results of our approach com- pared to SenseClusters and Humphrey et al. (2006) using the NLM-WSD dataset, and iv) the results of our approach compared to SenseClusters using the con(cid:3)ated dataset. The results of using an individualized IDF stoplist for each target word show an improvement over us- ing the basic stoplist. The results of our approach using different context descriptions show that for the NLM-WSD dataset the large differences in accuracy makes it unclear which of the context descriptions performed the best.

Return-to-sport progressions should be individualised based on the injury, athlete’s age, history and level of play, and the ability to provide close supervision during the return to activity, and progressions may vary between athletes. Each stage is generally 24 hours without return of concussion symptoms. Consider written clearance from a healthcare professional before return to sport as directed by local laws and regulations.3
Readership analysis was conducted on the 20 science journals in our data set (n(cid:1)2903). Articles published in the social sciences and humanities journals (n(cid:1)350) were omitted from the readership analysis, as many did not include abstract or full-text versions of their articles, and, in some cases, refer- ence views were added to full-text views, resulting in indeter- minate and incomparable results. Citation analyses were conducted on the entire article data set (n(cid:1)3245). A logistic regression model was used to estimate the likelihood of articles in each experimental group being cited within the first year after publication, controlling for journal and journal category effects.

While many of these symptoms can be seen with other conditions such as allergies, we ask that you seek medical evaluation if you identify any of these symptoms. Loss of taste or smell is very specific to COVID‐19 and may be described as food tasting bland, rather than not being able to taste. If your child develops any of these symptoms, please notify your child’s school, contact your child’s doctor for evaluation/testing, and keep your child home from school.

Participants agreed that some RA, even with good data and interesting results, will be rejected if the style and format of the paper are not tailored for the audience. This agrees with the results of investigations among 116 editors (Gosden, 1992; Fig. 1), who identified following most frequent causes to reject an L2 author: unclear text, incoherent development of the topic in paragraphs and incorrect use of grammar. In addition, the participants analysed an exemplary flawed paper by unknown author and decided to reject it after some discussion. The list of reasons for rejection can be seen in Table 1.

In addition to return to learning and sporting environments, older athletes may need to return to driving, where subtle defi- cits could compromise safety. Most sports medicine physicians do not counsel athletes with SRC about driving.90 Driving is a complex process involving coordination of cognitive, visual and motor skills, as well as concentration, attention, visual percep- tion, insight and memory, which can all be affected by SRC.90 Little is known about the risk of driving after SRC, but prelim- inary data suggest some impairment exists when patients with concussion report they are asymptomatic.91 Currently, no widely

The key idea is that you should read the paper in up to three passes, instead of starting at the beginning and plow- ing your way to the end. Each pass accomplishes specific goals and builds upon the previous pass: The first pass gives you a general idea about the paper. The second pass lets you grasp the paper’s content, but not its details. The third pass helps you understand the paper in depth.

medicine when following up n candidate molecules. The numerical solutions for this equation show that at least 48 molecules are to be evaluated for this probability to exceed 90%. The MMV discovery portfolio was built and funded to deliver two new preclinical candidates per year, and allowing for a third molecule coming from else- where, then this would still require some 16 years’ invest- ment per combination, except if there is a considerable increase in success rates going forwards (and a justifica- tion for this), or significantly increased investment. The hope on the horizon is that many of the new molecules are first-in-class, and so should they fail in clinical devel- opment there will be scope for well-defined back-up pro- jects, and these are normally much more cost-effective programmes. The definition of new molecular targets also opens up new possibilities for engaging the wider research community, allowing access to resources such as the EU’s European Lead Factory, which considers molec- ular targets but not phenotypic approaches.
AASM practice parameter papers are based on evidence- based review and grading of literature, often addressing a spe- cific issue or topic. Clinical guidelines provide clinicians with a working overview for disease or disorder evaluation and man- agement. These guidelines include practice parameter papers and also include areas with limited evidence in order to provide a comprehensive practice guideline. Both practice parameters and clinical guidelines define principles of practice that should meet the needs of most patients. They should not, however, be considered exhaustive, inclusive of all available methods of care, or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably expected to obtain the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding appropriateness of any specific therapy must be made by the clinician and patient in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible

medically related text and metadata features, such as “pa- tients,” “alzheimer,” “health information management,” and “medicine” are also important and of mostly positive polar- ity, since medical articles attract greater news coverage than, say, a recently published computer science paper. As we dis- cuss later, the presence of “alzheimer” as an important, neg- ative feature is more an artifact of the dataset than an iden- tification of trends in popularity. We also find an artifact of year (2016) of the dataset with the feature “zika virus,” due to the 2015-2016 zika epidemic in North and South Amer- ica.

For the (2 vs. 2) SVM schema, one can observe from Table 6 that the highest overall accuracy is 0.91 and generated by a feature combination of POS-based unigrams and K-array semantics-based sequential features, regardless of whether WordNet is used to correct the POS of a unigram or not. In terms of the kernel functions, a linear kernel is used at the first level of the SVM model and a polynomial kernel at the second level. In addition, we notice that the inclusion of bigrams (the last four rows in Table 6) does not improve accuracy but rather reduce the accuracy. This agrees with results reported in previous studies. Tables 7 and 8 present the confusion matrices resulted from the two best feature sets using the (2 vs. 2) SVM schema. These two tables elaborate the two optimal feature sets as highlighted in Table 6. Results are obtained by using a linear and a polynomial kernel at the two levels respectively and averaged over 10-fold cross validation. Notice that in certain cases, the model cannot ditinguish between positive and neutral polarities due to the reasons discussed above; while negative and no-relationship can often be correctly identified.

For newer targeted cancer medicines, there are two additional areas of uncertainty. Firstly, despite their established mechanisms of action, targeted cancer medicines may not have clinically-meaningful activities against all tumours with a matching genetic mutation. To this point, a clinical trial has found that the progression-free survival of patients with metastatic solid tumour refractory to standard of care did not improve with the use of targeted therapies that matched with the tumour’s molecular profile but outside their approved indications, compared to patients who received treatment at the choice of their treating physicians (79). This means that targeted therapies should only be used according to approved indications and not based on identified molecular alternations or the general type of cancer.

ability to sleep and the daytime consequences of poor sleep, dis- torted beliefs and attitudes about the origins and meaning of the insomnia, maladaptive efforts to accommodate to the condition (e.g., schedule or lifestyle changes), and excessive time spent awake in bed. The latter behavior is of particular significance in that it often is associated with “trying hard” to fall asleep and growing frustration and tension in the face of wakefulness. Thus, the bed becomes associated with a state of waking arousal as this conditioning paradigm repeats itself night after night.

Osteopathic medical schools also use differing cri- teria when selecting candidates to interview and/or extending offers of admission. For example, in the eval- uation of applicants, osteopathic medical schools place more emphasis on candidates’ interest in and knowledge of osteopathic philosophy. They also are more likely to seek out students who are interested in pursuing careers in primary care and in rural or underserved areas.3 Osteo- pathic admissions programs often view the candidate as a

These assignment guidelines pertain exclusively to Commercial Mobile Radio Service providers (CMRS). The IMSI Administrator directly administers only the Home Network Identity (HNI) segment of the resource. The HNI uniquely identifies the home wireless network of a FCC- licensed two-way CMRS subscriber and contains the Mobile Country Code (MCC) and the Mobile Network Code (MNC). The remaining segment of the IMSI, the Mobile Station Identification Number (MSIN), is directly administered by the wireless network licensee to which the HNI is assigned. Issue: In 1998, ITU Recommendation E.212 was modified allowing IMSI assignments to those Wireline Service Providers offering limited mobility services. As a result, HNI assignments are no longer available exclusively to CMRS providers. The current IMSI assignment and administrative guidelines do not however reflect these modifications.

Objectives of Phase 3. In Phase 3 the working group integrated the findings of the first 2 phases, refined the scoring system, and determined the optimal cut point to define “definite RA.” The goal of this final phase was to utilize the results of Phases 1 and 2 to develop a scoring system that would be applicable to newly presenting patients with undifferentiated inflam- matory arthritis to permit identification of those with a high probability of developing persistent and/or erosive RA. Being intended for use with newly presenting patients, the scoring system should be robust enough that it could be applied repeatedly during the early course of disease, such that a patient identified as not classifiable as having definite RA at initial presentation might be classified as having definite RA at a subsequent time point. The work was not aimed at classifying subjects with established disease, either active or inac- tive. However, the working group recognized that pa- tients may present for the first time with disease that is at a later stage and being treated. Thus, although it was not the explicit charge of the working group to provide

Although, it was assumed that the 'thicker' articles with wider range of vocabulary is preferable in the editors hands, the editors (and probably the readers) prefer simple, clear and coherent writing, rather than a fancy or complex, pseudo-scientific style. Also Funkhouser and Maccoby (1971) showed that the information gain is especially enhanced by the “use of examples", i.e. it helps a lot to use some non-science material, such as everyday life parallels, historical points, etc. On the other hand, some sections, such as Introduction and Discussion, have to intrigue readers and attract interest and should therefore not be over-simplified. For example, a mysterious title can catch readers' attention and will be easily remembered (e.g.: T.Y. Li and J. Yorke named their famous paper on chaos: "The period three means chaos"). Some sections require more skill and are more important. It is approximated that from all published journal RAs in the world, only less than 5% are read in detail. However, more than 50% of abstracts are read and so the quality of an abstracts is much more important (Gordon, 1983). Therefore, the abstract should present the 'story' of the RA in miniature and should be readable standalone.

The first pass is a quick scan to get a bird’s-eye view of the paper. You can also decide whether you need to do any more passes. This pass should take about five to ten minutes and consists of the following steps:
a) The regulation gives data subjects the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, where there is a legal or similarly significant effect on the person (the regulation prohibits automated processing where there is no meaningful human involvement in the decision and where the decision either impacts one’s legal rights, or the decision has the potential to significantly influence the circumstances, behavior, or choices of the individuals concerned). b) Other considerations: i) Research affecting the healthcare a person receives, where there is no human involvement in the decision, would be considered covered under the regulation (i.e., assigning trial subjects to receive an intervention or placebo, based solely on the individual’s personal data, i.e., test results)
Insomnia occurs in individuals of all ages and races, and has been observed across all cultures and countries.8,9 The actual prevalence of insomnia varies according to the stringency of the definition used. Insomnia symptoms occur in approximately 33% to 50% of the adult population; insomnia symptoms with dis- tress or impairment (i.e., general insomnia disorder) in 10% to 15%; and specific insomnia disorders in 5% to 10%.10 Consis- tent risk factors for insomnia include increasing age, female sex, comorbid (medical, psychiatric, sleep, and substance use) disor- ders, shift work, and possibly unemployment and lower socio- economic status. Patients with comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions are at particularly increased risk, with psychiatric and chronic pain disorders having insomnia rates as high as 50% to 75%.11-13 The risk relationship between insomnia and psychiatric disorders appears to be bidirectional; several studies have also

Some countries may place limits on the frequency and magnitude of price increments, or even impose a price freeze or price reduction (161,184). In the latter, pharmaceutical prices cannot be raised for a predetermined period of time unless there is a justification. For example, since August 2010 (and at least until 2022), Germany has implemented a moratorium to halt price increase for medicines that are not subject to reference pricing, except for inflation (185).

of the weakest links in the system. A study in Malawi revealed that the condition of many seriously ill children arriving at clinicshadnotpreviouslybeenrecognized.Insteadofreceiving immediate emergency care they were kept waiting for long periods before being given proper treatment. This resulted in avoidable deaths and disability (28). In Mexico, verbal autopsies of 132 children who died revealed that the majority had been seen by a physician within three days of death. Poor selection of medications and late referral to tertiary care were judged to be important contributory factors in more than half the deaths (29). A qualitative study of 21 hospitals in seven developing countries found that poor triage of incoming patients and inadequate provision of emergency care jeopar- dized the lives of arriving patients (30). Fourteen of the facilities (including 10 of 13 district hospitals) did not have an adequate triage system. A comprehensive review of the management of 131 children treated at these facilities found evidenceofinappropriateordelayedtriagein8%ofcases,poor clinical assessments in 41%, and potentially harmful delays in treatment in 19%. Several international health projects aimed at improving initial triage and treatment have been instituted at district health care facilities. Most focus on the strengthening of maternal and child health. One such project produced guidelines for emergency triage and treatment (28). An evaluation of these guidelines demonstrated that they significantly decreased the time required to assess children in need of urgent medical attention (31). In Sierra Leone a health care facility was upgraded in order to enhance its ability to provide prompt medical and surgicaltreatmenttowomenwithcomplicationsofpregnancy. The annual number of obstetric procedures rose from 2 to 38 over a period of five years. During the same period the
President Obama has recently expressed a strong conviction that “Science offers great potential for improving health”. The President has announced a research initiative that aims to accelerate progress toward a new era of precision medicine. The time is accurate for this idealistic initiative, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other partners will work to attain this vision [7]. The concept of precision medicine speaks of prevention and treatment strategies that take individual variability into account. Even though it is not new, the impact of practicality is still deprived. If one considers blood typing, for instance, has been used to guide blood transfusions for more than a century. But the vision of applying this concept broadly has been intensely improved by the latest development of large-scale biologic databases (such as the human genome sequence), powerful methods for typifying patients (such as proteomics, metabolomics, genomics, diverse cellular assays, and even mobile health technology), and computational tools for analyzing large sets of data. Francis S.Collins et al. stated that, “What is necessary now is a broad

The structural design of cavity walls should follow either rational or empirical methods. The rational design method is based on the properties of the wall materials and engineering analysis. This method may be used for any structure where high loads are likely or where tall walls are a necessity. The empirical method is generally satisfactory for one and two-story buildings consisting of light construction with limited floor spans and wall heights; and for multistory buildings where unsupported wall heights are not excessive.

Objectives of Phase 3. In Phase 3 the working group integrated the findings of the first 2 phases, refined the scoring system, and determined the optimal cut point to define “definite RA.” The goal of this final phase was to utilize the results of Phases 1 and 2 to develop a scoring system that would be applicable to newly presenting patients with undifferentiated inflam- matory arthritis to permit identification of those with a high probability of developing persistent and/or erosive RA. Being intended for use with newly presenting patients, the scoring system should be robust enough that it could be applied repeatedly during the early course of disease, such that a patient identified as not classifiable as having definite RA at initial presentation might be classified as having definite RA at a subsequent time point. The work was not aimed at classifying subjects with established disease, either active or inac- tive. However, the working group recognized that pa- tients may present for the first time with disease that is at a later stage and being treated. Thus, although it was not the explicit charge of the working group to provide

The key idea is that you should read the paper in up to three passes, instead of starting at the beginning and plow- ing your way to the end. Each pass accomplishes specific goals and builds upon the previous pass: The first pass gives you a general idea about the paper. The second pass lets you grasp the paper’s content, but not its details. The third pass helps you understand the paper in depth.

• Mood disturbances and cognitive difficulties. Complaints of irritability, loss of interest, mild depression and anxi- ety are common among insomnia patients. Patients with chronic insomnia often complain of mental inefficiency, difficulty remembering, difficulty focusing attention, and difficulty with complex mental tasks. • Quality of life: The irritability and fatigue associated with insomnia may cause interpersonal difficulties for insomnia patients, or avoidance of such activities. Conversely, in- terpersonal difficulties may be an important contributor to insomnia problems for some individuals. Sleep and wak- ing problems may lead to restriction of daytime activities, including social events, exercise, or work. Lack of regular daytime activities and exercise may in turn contribute to insomnia. • Exacerbation of comorbid conditions. Comorbid condi- tions may cause or increase sleep difficulties. Likewise, poor sleep may exacerbate symptomatology of comorbid conditions. Sleep complaints may herald the onset of mood disorders or exacerbation of comorbid conditions. VI.

The strength and moisture penetration resistance of a brick masonry cavity wall are affected by the mortar selection and compatibility with the brick units. Portland cement-lime, mortar cement, or masonry cement mortars can be used. However, mortars with an air content less than 12 percent are recommended for their superior bond strength and resistance to moisture penetration. The MSJC Code requires that the allowable flexural tensile stresses be reduced by approximately 50 percent for assemblies constructed with masonry cement mortars or portland cement-lime mortars that have air entrainment. In addition, some building codes prohibit the use of masonry cement mortars and all Type N mortars in Seismic Performance Categories D and E (formerly Seismic Zones 3 and 4). Mortar should meet the proportion requirements of ASTM C 270 Specification for Mortar for Unit Masonry as shown in Table 1. Mortar type selection should be based on project requirements, such as strength and compatibility with a particular brick unit. Types N or S mortars are typically used in brick masonry cavity walls. See Technical Notes 8 Series for more detailed information on mortar types and selection.

• Fatigue and sleepiness. Feelings of fatigue (low energy, physical tiredness, weariness) are more common than symptoms of sleepiness (actual tendency to fall asleep) in patients with chronic insomnia. The presence of significant sleepiness should prompt a search for other potential sleep disorders. The number, duration, and timing of naps should be thoroughly investigated, as both a consequence of in- somnia and a potential contributing factor.

The temperature change used for estimating thermal movements should be based on mean temperatures in the component. For solid masonry walls, tempera- tures at the center of the wall should be used. In cav- ity walls and veneers, the temperature at the center of each wythe or component should be used. In dis- continuous construction, the wythes will have different temperatures due to the separation of the wythes by an air space and perhaps insulation.

the fact that 11 of the 12 medicines approved by the United States Food &amp; Drug Administration (US FDA) in 2012 for various cancer indications were priced above US$ 100 000 per year. The experts asserted that the prices of these medicines were too high, unsustainable, might compromise access of needy patients to highly effective therapy, and harmful to the sustainability of national health care systems (30). Similarly, in 2015, yet another group of cancer experts have petitioned for lower medicine prices (31).

With some variation over time and across cancer types, care for the cancer population involves the six categories of services analyzed. The bars in Figures 2a-2c indicate that some patients had significant use of facility services in the year preceding the cancer diagnosis. For both colorectal and lung cancers, total spending on hospital inpatient increased as a percentage of total immediately following diagnosis. In all three cancers, the chemotherapy share of total spending increased rapidly in the first few months after diagnosis and, with the exception of breast cancer, continued at a fairly consistent level of around 20% of spending in subsequent years. Radiation therapy represented a small share of total spending except for breast cancer patients in the year following diagnosis.

medically related text and metadata features, such as “pa- tients,” “alzheimer,” “health information management,” and “medicine” are also important and of mostly positive polar- ity, since medical articles attract greater news coverage than, say, a recently published computer science paper. As we dis- cuss later, the presence of “alzheimer” as an important, neg- ative feature is more an artifact of the dataset than an iden- tification of trends in popularity. We also find an artifact of year (2016) of the dataset with the feature “zika virus,” due to the 2015-2016 zika epidemic in North and South Amer- ica.

6. Evaluating – can include commenting on the degrees of success and failure of something, or the value of something The ability to analyze and creatively adapt to new situations is at the heart of critical thinking. Paul and Elder (2008, 2014b) asserted that critical thinking provides a vehicle for educating the mind. John Dewey would agree, as from his early work, we have increased our sense of the pragmatic basis of human thought (its instrumental nature), and especially its grounding in actual human purposes, goals, and objectives. Dewey (1910) also discussed critical thinking in terms of reflective thinking, which is an uneasiness in accepting the status quo and that critical thinking is both an emotional and intellectual component. Students must, therefore, be taught to examine, poke, question, and reflect on what they have learned. Scepticism, questioning, and reflection is essential. Dewey also stated that schools should have an intimate relationship with the community it serves. From the review of the research concerning critical thinking and what components are considered important in high school education and later a life-long learning skill, the authors developed a 5-step, critical thinking teaching process as outlined in Table 2. Input from the study’s nine experts who reviewed the model and from suggestions from other model developers, led to the selection of easy to remember letters that describe each step’s process.

Sleep-inducing drugs (hypnotics) are medications specif- ically designed to induce sleepiness directly after intake. Optimal agents affect cognitive performance during this period while inducing minimal sleepiness in the waking day after use. An optimal hypnotic would have low tox- icity and addictive potential, as well a minimal side effect profile (Oswald 1970). Among the first hypnotics, and an agent still in use is chloral hydrate - the original “Mickey Finn” - slipped into the drinks of unsuspecting marks for the purposes of criminal activity. Unfortu- nately, this medication is difficult to use since the LD-50 (potentially fatal dose) is quite close to the therapeutic dose. In the years leading up to the 1970’s, rapidly acting barbiturates were commonly utilized for their hypnotic effects. Unfortunately, these medications, also drugs of abuse, had a significant danger of overdose and contrib- uted to an era that was characterized in part by deaths due to overdoses of sleeping pills. These medications and similar barbiturate-like medications [Methaqualone (Quaalude, Sopor) Glutethimide (Doriden), Ethchlor- vynol (Placidyl), Methyprylon (Nodudar)] have limited availability and are rarely used due to limited efficacy, cognitive effects, the potential for abuse and lethal tox- icity associated with overdose (Oswald 1970). Today their primary therapeutic uses include executions and fa- cilitated euthanasia (Lossignol 2008). Most currently utilized hypnotics affect the widely dis- persed negative neurotransmitter GABA. In the 1970’s benzodiazepines (GABA agonists) were first marketed as hypnotics. Some of these agents had an extremely short duration of action [Triazolam (Halcion)]. While this agent-induced minimal next day somnolence, use was as- sociated with daytime memory impairment, particularly at higher dosages (Roehrs et al. 2000; Adam and Oswald

President Obama has recently expressed a strong conviction that “Science offers great potential for improving health”. The President has announced a research initiative that aims to accelerate progress toward a new era of precision medicine. The time is accurate for this idealistic initiative, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other partners will work to attain this vision [7]. The concept of precision medicine speaks of prevention and treatment strategies that take individual variability into account. Even though it is not new, the impact of practicality is still deprived. If one considers blood typing, for instance, has been used to guide blood transfusions for more than a century. But the vision of applying this concept broadly has been intensely improved by the latest development of large-scale biologic databases (such as the human genome sequence), powerful methods for typifying patients (such as proteomics, metabolomics, genomics, diverse cellular assays, and even mobile health technology), and computational tools for analyzing large sets of data. Francis S.Collins et al. stated that, “What is necessary now is a broad

In the absence of financial support from governments, the treatment costs presented in Table 4.3 would not be affordable to individual patients. For example, a course of standard (adjuvant) treatment for early stage HER2 positive breast cancer (Adjuvant AC-TH) would cost about 10 years of average annual wages in India and South Africa, and 1.7 years in the USAxx. Patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in India, South Africa and the USA would require, respectively, 3.7 years, 5.6 years and 1.1 years of wages to cover for the costs of a

Reembolso é o ressarcimento das despesas decorrentes dos atendimentos ocorridos na área de abrangência geográfica da cobertura contratual sempre que não for possível a utilização dos serviços de prestadores da rede credenciada de cada plano. Para os planos que não possuem Livre Escolha (reembolso), os beneficiários deverão entrar em contato com o SAC buscando uma alternativa de atendimento no município onde o serviço ou o procedimento for demandado, desde que dentro da área de abrangência do Plano. O prazo para resposta é de até 7 (sete) dias úteis após a solicitação, caso não haja solução a Operadora concederá autorização de reembolso, sendo necessário apresentar o número de protocolo disponibilizado pela Central de Atendimento no contato inicial. Os beneficiários dos produtos 160 PLUS, 180 PLUS, 318 EXECUTIVO I e 318 EXECUTIVO II, poderão escolher qualquer prestador de serviços legalmente habilitado, que não sejam integrantes da rede credenciada para a realização dos procedimentos cobertos, ao qual pagará diretamente pelo serviço, solicitando posteriormente o reembolso, sendo que o ressarcimento dos valores obedecerá ao limite do plano contratado. O beneficiário titular declara que as informações constantes no pedido de reembolso são verdadeiras, estando ciente de que a não autenticidade dos documentos ou a omissão de qualquer informação, na tentativa de obter vantagem indevida, constitui fraude contra a Operadora, sujeito a perda do direito ao reembolso, cancelamento do plano de saúde e implicações judiciais, além de que o fato será imediatamente comunicado ao empregador (RH) e/ou representante legal da Pessoa Jurídica contratante do plano de saúde. As principais irregularidades não admitidas são: desdobramento de recibos; recibos de atendimento de pessoas diversas (não beneficiários do plano); recibos de atendimento de terceiros (ainda que conste o beneficiário como pagador); recibos falsos, adul- terados ou rasurados. Lembramos ainda que este rol não é taxativo, mas sim exemplificativo. A Operadora reserva-se no direito de contatar o prestador de serviços, emitente do recibo, sempre que julgar necessário, para comprovar e atestar a veracidade das informações. Para receber o reembolso é obrigatória a apresentação deste formulário devidamente preenchido, assim como a documentação exigida (check-list no verso) para cada tipo de serviço. A análise da solicitação e o reembolso serão efetuados no prazo de 30 dias a partir da data do recebimento da docu- mentação na Life Empresarial Saúde.

prices of pharmaceuticals grew faster than the collective prices of all goods and services (Fig. 4.6a, p.61). However, the trends in the two countries began to diverge in the late 1980s where the price level of medicines continued to rise faster in the USA, while the growth rate of pharmaceutical prices in Australia seemed to have been stabilized at around 10% higher than the consumer price index. This could possibly be due to the introduction of “cost effectiveness” as a requirement before listing a medicine on the national pharmaceutical insurance scheme, so as to ensure the benefits of a given medicine were high enough to justify the price requested by the manufacturer (246). The divergence became more prominent when the Australian Government undertook further reforms of its national scheme after 2005 (247), which was implemented in response to a report that warned “in 40 years’ time, the PBS could account for 3.4% of GDP, making it the largest part of the Government’s spending on health” (248). The reforms seem to have resulted in gradual normalization of the growth rate of medicine prices in Australia to a level in line with the overall inflation rate of other consumer goods (Fig. 4.6a). In contrast, medicine prices continued to grow considerably in the USA, with the cumulative growth reaching 2.4 times the overall inflation rate of other consumer goods in 2017. Of note, the price level of prescription medicines in the USA rose in parallel with Pricing and reimbursement policies in Australia over four decades have controlled the growth rate of medicine prices.

These assignment guidelines pertain exclusively to Commercial Mobile Radio Service providers (CMRS). The IMSI Administrator directly administers only the Home Network Identity (HNI) segment of the resource. The HNI uniquely identifies the home wireless network of a FCC- licensed two-way CMRS subscriber and contains the Mobile Country Code (MCC) and the Mobile Network Code (MNC). The remaining segment of the IMSI, the Mobile Station Identification Number (MSIN), is directly administered by the wireless network licensee to which the HNI is assigned. Issue: In 1998, ITU Recommendation E.212 was modified allowing IMSI assignments to those Wireline Service Providers offering limited mobility services. As a result, HNI assignments are no longer available exclusively to CMRS providers. The current IMSI assignment and administrative guidelines do not however reflect these modifications.

In the late 1800s, Andrew Taylor Still identified the neuromusculoskeletal system as the key element in health maintenance and stressed preventive aspects of medi- cine in place of drug therapy. During that time, osteop- athy was truly separate and distinct from the world of allo- pathic medicine. Since then, as medicine in general has become more evidence-based and supported by research, osteopathic philosophy has evolved into a more complete and robust osteopathic medicine. The phrase “osteopathic medicine” is now the accepted term for the profession over “osteopathy,” a now-antiquated term that represents a period when Still championed a near-drugless form of manual medicine. Since its conception, osteopathic med- icine has adapted its body of knowledge to incorporate contemporary scientific thought, including germ theory, pharmacology, and other “allopathic” teachings. The cen- tral tenets of osteopathic thought, however, have been maintained and continue to guide DOs in their practice of medicine. Though interprofessional relations between MDs and DOs are better than they have ever been before, challenges still exist in terms of keeping the osteopathic tradition intact, improving the evidence basis of OMM via clinical research, and advocating for widespread recogni- tion of DOs.

The naïve interpretation of this is that no more than 13 candidate compounds would be needed for a reasonable chance of launching one new medicine, and 25 for a com- bination with two NCEs (new chemical entities). How- ever, if one aims for a 90% overall chance of success (P), the number of candidates n, each with a success probabil- ity s (8%) is described by the negative binomial distribu- tion in Eq. 1.

Osteopathic medical schools also use differing cri- teria when selecting candidates to interview and/or extending offers of admission. For example, in the eval- uation of applicants, osteopathic medical schools place more emphasis on candidates’ interest in and knowledge of osteopathic philosophy. They also are more likely to seek out students who are interested in pursuing careers in primary care and in rural or underserved areas.3 Osteo- pathic admissions programs often view the candidate as a

Participants agreed that some RA, even with good data and interesting results, will be rejected if the style and format of the paper are not tailored for the audience. This agrees with the results of investigations among 116 editors (Gosden, 1992; Fig. 1), who identified following most frequent causes to reject an L2 author: unclear text, incoherent development of the topic in paragraphs and incorrect use of grammar. In addition, the participants analysed an exemplary flawed paper by unknown author and decided to reject it after some discussion. The list of reasons for rejection can be seen in Table 1.

The key idea is that you should read the paper in up to three passes, instead of starting at the beginning and plow- ing your way to the end. Each pass accomplishes specific goals and builds upon the previous pass: The first pass gives you a general idea about the paper. The second pass lets you grasp the paper’s content, but not its details. The third pass helps you understand the paper in depth.

Readership analysis was conducted on the 20 science journals in our data set (n(cid:1)2903). Articles published in the social sciences and humanities journals (n(cid:1)350) were omitted from the readership analysis, as many did not include abstract or full-text versions of their articles, and, in some cases, refer- ence views were added to full-text views, resulting in indeter- minate and incomparable results. Citation analyses were conducted on the entire article data set (n(cid:1)3245). A logistic regression model was used to estimate the likelihood of articles in each experimental group being cited within the first year after publication, controlling for journal and journal category effects.

The analysis found that low-income countries could spend on average up to US$ 3800 per cancer patient annually on cancer medicines for all newly-diagnosed cancer patients, and the total expenditure on these medicines would be within the generously assumed 5% of the total health expenditure (Table 4.2). In high- income countries, the analysis found that a budget threshold of 5% of the total health expenditure would allow a spending of up to US$ 40 600 on cancer medicines per patient per year, with a view to providing universal coverage.

The temperature change used for estimating thermal movements should be based on mean temperatures in the component. For solid masonry walls, tempera- tures at the center of the wall should be used. In cav- ity walls and veneers, the temperature at the center of each wythe or component should be used. In dis- continuous construction, the wythes will have different temperatures due to the separation of the wythes by an air space and perhaps insulation.

IC 50 values are determined by linear regression analyses on the linear segments of the curves (IC 90 values can also be determined by curve-fitting and can provide an useful measure of variation between experiments). Assays are typically repeated on two or three separate occasions. Within each experiment, standard deviations are typically less than 10% of the mean. Differences in parasite stages of development can lead to up to two-fold shifts in the IC 50 values between experiments; however, these differences rarely affect the overall relationships between the parasite lines in terms of their differences in drug response 4-11 .

Of note, mice under single or combined metformin treatments showed an extended survival, whereas 84% of the nontreat- ed mice succumbed within 1 week after infection (Table 1). In conclusion, metformin treatment in combi- nation with suboptimal dosage of conventional antimalarials is more efficacious in reducing parasite load.

The inclusion of SPX Weeklys in the VIX Index calculation means that the near-term options will always have more than 23 days to expiration and the next-term options always have less than 37 days to expiration, so the resulting VIX Index value will always reflect an interpolation of σ2 1 and σ2 2 ; i.e., each individual weight is less than or equal to 1 and the sum of the weights equals 1.

medicine (NMM) and OMM obtain many more hundreds of hours of manual medicine training in a wider variety of clinical settings than DCs and other DOs. This section was meant to give you a better sense of what “osteopathic manipulative medicine” entails, and hopefully it answered most of your questions regarding OMM. The effectiveness of OMM remains a topic of ongoing debate and research despite past and current efforts to lay these arguments to rest. Whether an osteo- pathic physician uses OMM in his or her practice is based entirely on preference. With that said, it is an important core discipline and primary distinction of the osteopathic profession.
ability to sleep and the daytime consequences of poor sleep, dis- torted beliefs and attitudes about the origins and meaning of the insomnia, maladaptive efforts to accommodate to the condition (e.g., schedule or lifestyle changes), and excessive time spent awake in bed. The latter behavior is of particular significance in that it often is associated with “trying hard” to fall asleep and growing frustration and tension in the face of wakefulness. Thus, the bed becomes associated with a state of waking arousal as this conditioning paradigm repeats itself night after night.

In this paper, we describe a novel feature space designed to effectively classify the polarity and strength of relationships extracted from biomedical abstracts. In addition to the conventional syntactic features such as unigrams and bigrams, we have also explored and constructed semantics-based sequential features. These features are constructed at three different levels: entity, phrase, and sentence. A wrapper-based method is then used to select the optimal feature sets for both polarity and strength prediction. Specifically, a multi-stage SVM classifier and an SVR predictor are built for polarity and strength prediction, respectively. Two different schemas, namely, (1 vs. all) and (2 vs. 2), are employed to build the multi-stage SVM. Finally, three different kernel functions are considered at different stage of this SVM classifier. Our intensive evaluations have shown that for polarity prediction, the (2 vs. 2) schema in general works better than the (1 vs. all). It produces the highest polarity accuracy of 0.91 when both unigrams and semantics-based sequential structures (KSS) are used, with a standard error ranging between 0.01~0.02. On the other hand, we find that for strength prediction, unigrams solely can produce satisfying results. We obtain a high accuracy of 0.96, with the standard error ranging between 0.61%~0.63% for the strength analysis. We are currently expanding our annotated corpus to facilitate further validation of the findings reported in this work. We are also integrating this module with other modules as shown in Figure 1 towards building a quantitative food-disease-gene network. Finally, we are creating an interactive user interface to visually present this network.

Phase 1. The aim of Phase 1 was to identify the contributions of clinical and laboratory variables that in practice were the most predictive of the decision to initiate DMARD therapy in a population of patients with early undifferentiated synovitis. Initiation of DMARD therapy was used as an indicator of the physician’s opinion that the patient was at risk of developing persistent and/or erosive arthritis that we would currently consider to be RA. Data on 3,115 patients from 9 early arthritis cohorts who were consid- ered not to have evidence of another possible diagnosis explaining their presentation were obtained. Between July 2007 and November 2008 an expert working group developed an analysis strategy that related an agreed- upon list of standardized clinical and laboratory vari- ables collected at baseline to the initiation of DMARD treatment within the next 12 months. MTX initiation was used as the gold standard for this purpose. The analytical process aimed to identify the independent contribution of each variable on this list and included univariate regression modeling, a subsequent principal components analysis, and a multivariate regression model that included all identified components (25). The resulting list of informative variables identified during that process and the weights based on the odds ratios are shown in Table 1. Phase 2. Phase 2 consisted of a consensus-based, decision science–informed approach, which took place between November 2008 and June 2009. The purpose of this phase was to derive a clinician-based judgment on

of the weakest links in the system. A study in Malawi revealed that the condition of many seriously ill children arriving at clinicshadnotpreviouslybeenrecognized.Insteadofreceiving immediate emergency care they were kept waiting for long periods before being given proper treatment. This resulted in avoidable deaths and disability (28). In Mexico, verbal autopsies of 132 children who died revealed that the majority had been seen by a physician within three days of death. Poor selection of medications and late referral to tertiary care were judged to be important contributory factors in more than half the deaths (29). A qualitative study of 21 hospitals in seven developing countries found that poor triage of incoming patients and inadequate provision of emergency care jeopar- dized the lives of arriving patients (30). Fourteen of the facilities (including 10 of 13 district hospitals) did not have an adequate triage system. A comprehensive review of the management of 131 children treated at these facilities found evidenceofinappropriateordelayedtriagein8%ofcases,poor clinical assessments in 41%, and potentially harmful delays in treatment in 19%. Several international health projects aimed at improving initial triage and treatment have been instituted at district health care facilities. Most focus on the strengthening of maternal and child health. One such project produced guidelines for emergency triage and treatment (28). An evaluation of these guidelines demonstrated that they significantly decreased the time required to assess children in need of urgent medical attention (31).

Sport-specific rules may not allow adequate time for evaluation, and modifying these rules remains an area for improvement within the governing bodies of some sports. (C) When the sports medicine clinician becomes aware of a poten- tial injury, the athlete is approached and a brief history of the event is obtained from the athlete and those who witnessed the event or athlete behaviour.

veys, and frequent teleconference discussions, the expert panel identified consensus areas and recommendations for those areas not covered by AASM practice parameters. Recommendations were generated by panel members and discussed by all. To min- imize individual expert bias, the group anonymously voted and rated consensus recommendations from 1: strongly disagree to 9: strongly agree. Consensus was defined when all experts rated a recommendation 8 or 9. If consensus was not evident after the first vote, the consensus recommendations were discussed again, amended as appropriate, and a second anonymous vote was conducted. If consensus was not evident after the second vote, the process was repeated until consensus was attained to include or exclude a recommendation.

The temperature change used for estimating thermal movements should be based on mean temperatures in the component. For solid masonry walls, tempera- tures at the center of the wall should be used. In cav- ity walls and veneers, the temperature at the center of each wythe or component should be used. In dis- continuous construction, the wythes will have different temperatures due to the separation of the wythes by an air space and perhaps insulation.

istic option. Clinical diagnosis offers the advantages of ease, speed, and low cost. In areas where malaria is prevalent, clinical diagnosis usually results in all patients with fever and no apparent other cause being treated for malaria. This approach can iden- tify most patients who truly need antimalarial treat- ment, but it is also likely to misclassify many who do not (15). Over-diagnosis can be considerable and contributes to misuse of antimalarial drugs. Considerable overlap exists between the signs and

Medical misdiagnosis, in the form of inaccurate, late, and delayed diagnoses, is an ongoing problem in the U.S. Not only do these diagnostic errors present an ongoing risk to the health and safety of patients, but they also cost the economy billions of dollars.
Properties of insulation materials vary widely. Table 3 shows various properties of insulation materials used in brick masonry cavity walls. The thermal conductivity (k) and thermal resistance (R) provide a means of comparing the insulating properties of insulation materials. These are determined in accordance with ASTM C 177 Test Method for Steady-State Heat Flux Measurements and Thermal Transmission Properties by Means of the Guarded-Hot-Plate Apparatus measured at various temperatures. Due to the large number of types of insulation, and even larger number of manufacturers, Table 3 lists only a few representative values of physical properties. For some materials, an aged or stabilized value is given. In all cases, the aged or stabilized value is the one that should be used in design. Individual manufacturers should be consulted for design values and other properties of their specific materials and their applications.

Proper Sizing-Firebox dimensions should be selected so that the fire fills the combustion chamber during operation. This provides greater heating efficiency. Careful consideration should be given to size of the fireplace opening best suited for the room in which it is to be located. Location and size are important not only from the standpoint of appearance, but also of operation. If the fireplace opening is too small, it may function properly but will not produce enough heat to warm the room. If the opening is too large, a fire that would fill the combustion chamber may overwhelm the room. In such a case, the firebox opening would require a larger flue area and consume larger amounts of interior air even if exterior combustion air is provided. Table 2 provides suggested widths of conventional fireplace openings appropriate for various room sizes. For example, a room with 300 ft2 (28 m2) of floor area is best served by a fireplace with an opening 30 in. (750 mm) to 36 in. (900 mm) wide.

President Obama has recently expressed a strong conviction that “Science offers great potential for improving health”. The President has announced a research initiative that aims to accelerate progress toward a new era of precision medicine. The time is accurate for this idealistic initiative, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other partners will work to attain this vision [7]. The concept of precision medicine speaks of prevention and treatment strategies that take individual variability into account. Even though it is not new, the impact of practicality is still deprived. If one considers blood typing, for instance, has been used to guide blood transfusions for more than a century. But the vision of applying this concept broadly has been intensely improved by the latest development of large-scale biologic databases (such as the human genome sequence), powerful methods for typifying patients (such as proteomics, metabolomics, genomics, diverse cellular assays, and even mobile health technology), and computational tools for analyzing large sets of data. Francis S.Collins et al. stated that, “What is necessary now is a broad

In addition to return to learning and sporting environments, older athletes may need to return to driving, where subtle defi- cits could compromise safety. Most sports medicine physicians do not counsel athletes with SRC about driving.90 Driving is a complex process involving coordination of cognitive, visual and motor skills, as well as concentration, attention, visual percep- tion, insight and memory, which can all be affected by SRC.90 Little is known about the risk of driving after SRC, but prelim- inary data suggest some impairment exists when patients with concussion report they are asymptomatic.91 Currently, no widely

Insomnia occurs in individuals of all ages and races, and has been observed across all cultures and countries.8,9 The actual prevalence of insomnia varies according to the stringency of the definition used. Insomnia symptoms occur in approximately 33% to 50% of the adult population; insomnia symptoms with dis- tress or impairment (i.e., general insomnia disorder) in 10% to 15%; and specific insomnia disorders in 5% to 10%.10 Consis- tent risk factors for insomnia include increasing age, female sex, comorbid (medical, psychiatric, sleep, and substance use) disor- ders, shift work, and possibly unemployment and lower socio- economic status. Patients with comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions are at particularly increased risk, with psychiatric and chronic pain disorders having insomnia rates as high as 50% to 75%.11-13 The risk relationship between insomnia and psychiatric disorders appears to be bidirectional; several studies have also

For newer targeted cancer medicines, there are two additional areas of uncertainty. Firstly, despite their established mechanisms of action, targeted cancer medicines may not have clinically-meaningful activities against all tumours with a matching genetic mutation. To this point, a clinical trial has found that the progression-free survival of patients with metastatic solid tumour refractory to standard of care did not improve with the use of targeted therapies that matched with the tumour’s molecular profile but outside their approved indications, compared to patients who received treatment at the choice of their treating physicians (79). This means that targeted therapies should only be used according to approved indications and not based on identified molecular alternations or the general type of cancer.

With some variation over time and across cancer types, care for the cancer population involves the six categories of services analyzed. The bars in Figures 2a-2c indicate that some patients had significant use of facility services in the year preceding the cancer diagnosis. For both colorectal and lung cancers, total spending on hospital inpatient increased as a percentage of total immediately following diagnosis. In all three cancers, the chemotherapy share of total spending increased rapidly in the first few months after diagnosis and, with the exception of breast cancer, continued at a fairly consistent level of around 20% of spending in subsequent years. Radiation therapy represented a small share of total spending except for breast cancer patients in the year following diagnosis.

Reassessments might be per- formed less frequently for patients with more stable pain (eg, patients who have exhibited good pain con- trol without side effects after 24 hours of stable ther- apy). Pain reassessments might be useful at the time of nursing shift changes or with new caregivers to establish a baseline and promote continuity of care, although evidence showing that routine reassessment of pain at nursing shift changes is associated with improved clinical outcomes is not available.

Profit control is an effective measure to manage medicine prices insofar as the regulators have control over the supply of medicines at certain points along the supply chain. Typically, this means that the regulator needs to have full visibility of the supply and distribution chains. The regulator also needs to have the capacity and ability to enforce non-compliance. Profit control is most effective when there is a publicly- funded universal programme for the provision of medicines. In contrast, it may be much less effective in health care settings where the private sector plays a significant role in the delivery of medicines, or where the structure of supply chain is complex or under-developed (183).

The prevailing models of emergency medical transport used in North America and Western Europe are quite costly and would be impractical for most low-income countries. Severe resource constraints, the poor condition of roads or trails, and a lack of fuel may dictate the utilization of a wider range of options. In the United Republic of Tanzania, for example, modes of emergency transportation include motor- boats, canoes, bicycles with trailers, tricycles with platforms, tractors with trailers, reconditioned vehicles, and ox carts (22).

IC 50 values are determined by linear regression analyses on the linear segments of the curves (IC 90 values can also be determined by curve-fitting and can provide an useful measure of variation between experiments). Assays are typically repeated on two or three separate occasions. Within each experiment, standard deviations are typically less than 10% of the mean. Differences in parasite stages of development can lead to up to two-fold shifts in the IC 50 values between experiments; however, these differences rarely affect the overall relationships between the parasite lines in terms of their differences in drug response 4-11 .

In summary, public and non-profit-making sectors, and by extension tax-payers and philanthropists, have provided considerable financial and non-financial contributions towards the R&amp;D of cancer medicines. This means that in many cases, pharmaceutical companies have not incurred the full costs of R&amp;D. The pharmaceutical industry has also benefited greatly from the knowledge generated by public-sector investments in R&amp;D, and by having access to research supported by public funding at costs, if any, lower than the market value.
Recent analyses of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)- Medicare database tracked healthcare use and costs (projected to 2004 levels) from diagnosis and initial treatment [ 15 ] , in addition to a 4-year follow-up [ 17 ] , for a cohort of 81 659 elderly patients with prostate cancer who had Medicare claims from 1991 to 2003 [ 15 ] , and 1991 to 2004 [ 17 ] , respectively. Treatment in the fi rst year after diagnosis was calculated to incur costs of $21 040 per patient; $13 091 for prostate cancer-related costs and $7949 for medical costs unrelated to prostate cancer [ 15 ] . In terms of cost at each stage, as expected, there was an increase in costs from stage I to IV [ 15,17 ] . Prostate cancer-related costs over 4 years from diagnosis averaged $18 168 per patient [ 17 ] . The annual healthcare cost burden estimated in 2009 is &gt; $2.5 billion annually for initial care alone [ 17 ] .

Incidentally, when you write a paper, you can expect most reviewers (and readers) to make only one pass over it. Take care to choose coherent section and sub-section titles and to write concise and comprehensive abstracts. If a reviewer cannot understand the gist after one pass, the paper will likely be rejected; if a reader cannot understand the high- lights of the paper after five minutes, the paper will likely never be read.

under mefloquine or metformin single-drug treatments (P = 0.013 and P = 0.041; Figure 3C). Of note, mice under single or combined metformin treatments showed an extended survival, whereas 84% of the nontreat- ed mice succumbed within 1 week after infection (Table 1). In conclusion, metformin treatment in combi- nation with suboptimal dosage of conventional antimalarials is more efficacious in reducing parasite load.

The prevailing models of emergency medical transport used in North America and Western Europe are quite costly and would be impractical for most low-income countries. Severe resource constraints, the poor condition of roads or trails, and a lack of fuel may dictate the utilization of a wider range of options. In the United Republic of Tanzania, for example, modes of emergency transportation include motor- boats, canoes, bicycles with trailers, tricycles with platforms, tractors with trailers, reconditioned vehicles, and ox carts (22).

industry for anti-infectives overall, and significantly better than for other therapeutic areas, such as neurol- ogy and oncology. One difficulty with such an analysis is that new chemotypes have an inherently higher risk than additional members of established chemical classes, other than the risks of failure due to resistance (which are higher for drugs that have been used for many years). For this review’s new analysis (Table 8), new chemotypes are separated from life-cycle management projects. The overall success rates have not changed significantly in the last 3 years, either for MMV or for the CMR benchmark, which is reassuring. The data shows that a new molecule in formal preclinical evaluation has an 8% chance of becoming part of a product.

6. Evaluating – can include commenting on the degrees of success and failure of something, or the value of something The ability to analyze and creatively adapt to new situations is at the heart of critical thinking. Paul and Elder (2008, 2014b) asserted that critical thinking provides a vehicle for educating the mind. John Dewey would agree, as from his early work, we have increased our sense of the pragmatic basis of human thought (its instrumental nature), and especially its grounding in actual human purposes, goals, and objectives. Dewey (1910) also discussed critical thinking in terms of reflective thinking, which is an uneasiness in accepting the status quo and that critical thinking is both an emotional and intellectual component. Students must, therefore, be taught to examine, poke, question, and reflect on what they have learned. Scepticism, questioning, and reflection is essential. Dewey also stated that schools should have an intimate relationship with the community it serves. From the review of the research concerning critical thinking and what components are considered important in high school education and later a life-long learning skill, the authors developed a 5-step, critical thinking teaching process as outlined in Table 2. Input from the study’s nine experts who reviewed the model and from suggestions from other model developers, led to the selection of easy to remember letters that describe each step’s process.

The analysis found that low-income countries could spend on average up to US$ 3800 per cancer patient annually on cancer medicines for all newly-diagnosed cancer patients, and the total expenditure on these medicines would be within the generously assumed 5% of the total health expenditure (Table 4.2). In high- income countries, the analysis found that a budget threshold of 5% of the total health expenditure would allow a spending of up to US$ 40 600 on cancer medicines per patient per year, with a view to providing universal coverage.

Non load- bearing concrete masonry units are usually specified for the interior wythe when the brick and block cavity wall is used as infill walls for concrete or steel frame structural systems if shear loads are not transmitted to that wythe.

Based on the size of the flue selected, a preliminary damper size must be assumed. At this point in the design process, it is only necessary to decide if the damper throat area to be used will be equal to or twice the flue area. Once this decision has been made the Inlet Loss Coefficient, K 2, may be determined. If the damper throat area is equal to the flue area, K 2 is equal to 2.5. If the damper throat is twice the flue area, K 2 is equal to 1.0.

The statewide assessments in mathematics, reading, and science are used to measure whether students, and their school and district, are meeting the academic standards. Statewide assessments are one measure of how well students are doing on the content that is part of their daily instruction. It is also a measure of how well schools and districts are doing in aligning their curriculum and teaching the standards.

The key idea is that you should read the paper in up to three passes, instead of starting at the beginning and plow- ing your way to the end. Each pass accomplishes specific goals and builds upon the previous pass: The first pass gives you a general idea about the paper. The second pass lets you grasp the paper’s content, but not its details. The third pass helps you understand the paper in depth.
Many complicated and expensive techniques have been applied extensively in literature to extract relationships and dependencies from data. These techniques generally rely on a deep parse results that gives a rich representation which is used for applications in knowledge extraction and semantics. The problem with biomedical data parsing is that there is no exhaustive tagged training corpus available to build models for efficient parsing on test data. Also, deep parsing is computationally very expensive compared to shallow parsing that uses the finite state automaton techniques. UMLS graciously provides such a shallow parser[7] that is trained on entire Medline corpus and claims to achieve over 97% accuracy.
the context description CUI→ST obtains the high- est overall accuracy. On the con(cid:3)ated dataset, the pseudowords a a, a o, d d and e e have a corresponding CUI de(cid:2)ni- tion for each of their possible concepts therefore the accuracy for CUI and CUI→ would be the same for these datasets and is not reported. The pseudowords a a i, x p p and d a m e do not have a CUI de(cid:2)ni- tions for each of their possible concepts. The results show that CUI obtained the highest accuracy for six out of the seven datasets and CUI→ST obtained the highest accuracy for one. These experiments were run using the unigram feature.

Incidentally, when you write a paper, you can expect most reviewers (and readers) to make only one pass over it. Take care to choose coherent section and sub-section titles and to write concise and comprehensive abstracts. If a reviewer cannot understand the gist after one pass, the paper will likely be rejected; if a reader cannot understand the high- lights of the paper after five minutes, the paper will likely never be read.

samples)) / (geometric mean cpm of no drug samples). Percentage reductions are used to plot percentage inhibition of growth as a function of drug concentrations. IC 50 values are determined by linear regression analyses on the linear segments of the curves (IC 90 values can also be determined by curve-fitting and can provide an useful measure of variation between experiments). Assays are typically repeated on two or three separate occasions. Within each experiment, standard deviations are typically less than 10% of the mean. Differences in parasite stages of development can lead to up to two-fold shifts in the IC 50 values between experiments; however, these differences rarely affect the overall relationships between the parasite lines in terms of their differences in drug response 4-11 .
Phase 1. The aim of Phase 1 was to identify the contributions of clinical and laboratory variables that in practice were the most predictive of the decision to initiate DMARD therapy in a population of patients with early undifferentiated synovitis. Initiation of DMARD therapy was used as an indicator of the physician’s opinion that the patient was at risk of developing persistent and/or erosive arthritis that we would currently consider to be RA. Data on 3,115 patients from 9 early arthritis cohorts who were consid- ered not to have evidence of another possible diagnosis explaining their presentation were obtained. Between July 2007 and November 2008 an expert working group developed an analysis strategy that related an agreed- upon list of standardized clinical and laboratory vari- ables collected at baseline to the initiation of DMARD treatment within the next 12 months. MTX initiation was used as the gold standard for this purpose. The analytical process aimed to identify the independent contribution of each variable on this list and included univariate regression modeling, a subsequent principal components analysis, and a multivariate regression model that included all identified components (25). The resulting list of informative variables identified during that process and the weights based on the odds ratios are shown in Table 1. Phase 2. Phase 2 consisted of a consensus-based, decision science–informed approach, which took place between November 2008 and June 2009. The purpose of this phase was to derive a clinician-based judgment on

We used an expert provided list of 42 relevant domain terms for the Myocardial Perfusion Imaging domain (a sub-domain of nuclear cardiology) to heuristically test the coverage of our ontology terms. Of these, we found 31 exactly matching terms, 2 morphological variants and 8 phrases that contained the terms from the expert list. Out of this 42 domain terms, 1 term, ‘dyperidamole’, was not found in our ontology (dyperidamole is a drug given during pregnancy). We found that this term didn’t exist in the 618 JNC abstracts we were using. Instead, another term, diperidamole (spelling variant) existed in our term list. To do away with noise in our data, we selected terms with greater than average frequency (2.9) of the 10191 retrieved terms and set that as our threshold. We pruned the list to

Readership analysis was conducted on the 20 science journals in our data set (n(cid:1)2903). Articles published in the social sciences and humanities journals (n(cid:1)350) were omitted from the readership analysis, as many did not include abstract or full-text versions of their articles, and, in some cases, refer- ence views were added to full-text views, resulting in indeter- minate and incomparable results. Citation analyses were conducted on the entire article data set (n(cid:1)3245). A logistic regression model was used to estimate the likelihood of articles in each experimental group being cited within the first year after publication, controlling for journal and journal category effects.
A similar calculation is performed for each option. The resulting values for the near-term options are then summed and multiplied by 2/T 1. Likewise, the resulting values for the next-term options are summed and multiplied by 2/T 2. The table below summarizes the results for each strip of options.

What is the purpose of a RA and what makes it a good one, and who decides that it is a good RA? Are there rules for easier writing? If the main function of a RA is to transfer a new knowledge on a research topic, then a good paper is the one that is clear, coherent, focused, well argued and uses language that does not have ambiguous or equivoque meaning. However, it is not only the message that is important. The RA must have a well-defined structure and function in serve like a cook-book, so the others can reproduce and repeat explained experiments. Answer research questions Give summary conclusions There are some rules that can make the writing and publishing of RAs 'easier'. Here, we summarised some 'golden' rules that should always be in the mind of an inexperienced researcher (Table 3). We put all these together to make a final list of some 40 logical steps, which can be find in the Appendix.

There are debates about whether the returns generated from the sales of medicines, including cancer medicines, are sufficient for pharmaceutical companies to cover their past R&amp;D expenses, maintain their operations and engage in future drug discovery research. For example, some commentators have observed that the revenue generated from the sales of imatinib had exceeded the costs of R&amp;D within two years and “the revenues over the subsequent years of the patent would represent generous profits to the company” (30). Another study found that total revenue from the sales of 10 cancer medicines since approval over a median of four years (US$ 67.0 billion) was 9.3 times the total R&amp;D spending of US$ 7.2 billion (or 7.4 times using an estimated risk-adjusted R&amp;D costs of US$ 9.1 billion) (94).
If you are declining enrollment for yourself or your dependents (including your spouse) because of other health insurance coverage, you may in the future be able to enroll yourself or your dependents in this health plan, provided that you request enrollment within 30 days after your other coverage ends.

a) The regulation gives data subjects the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, where there is a legal or similarly significant effect on the person (the regulation prohibits automated processing where there is no meaningful human involvement in the decision and where the decision either impacts one’s legal rights, or the decision has the potential to significantly influence the circumstances, behavior, or choices of the individuals concerned). b) Other considerations: i) Research affecting the healthcare a person receives, where there is no human involvement in the decision, would be considered covered under the regulation (i.e., assigning trial subjects to receive an intervention or placebo, based solely on the individual’s personal data, i.e., test results)
Incidentally, when you write a paper, you can expect most reviewers (and readers) to make only one pass over it. Take care to choose coherent section and sub-section titles and to write concise and comprehensive abstracts. If a reviewer cannot understand the gist after one pass, the paper will likely be rejected; if a reader cannot understand the high- lights of the paper after five minutes, the paper will likely never be read.

There are many, often complicated, mechanisms of efflorescence. Simply stated, efflorescence occurs when water containing dissolved salts is brought to the surface of masonry, the water evaporates and the salts are left on the surface of the masonry. The salt solutions may migrate across surfaces of masonry units, between the mortar and units, or through the pores of the mortar or units.

The structural design of cavity walls should follow either rational or empirical methods. The rational design method is based on the properties of the wall materials and engineering analysis. This method may be used for any structure where high loads are likely or where tall walls are a necessity. The empirical method is generally satisfactory for one and two-story buildings consisting of light construction with limited floor spans and wall heights; and for multistory buildings where unsupported wall heights are not excessive.

(cid:2) The panel recommends that clinicians offer multi- modal analgesia, or the use of a variety of analgesic medications and techniques combined with non- pharmacological interventions, for the treatment of postoperative pain in children and adults (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Multimodal analgesia, defined as the use of a variety of analgesic medication and techniques that target different mechanisms of action in the peripheral and/or central nervous system (which might also be combined with nonpharmacological interventions) might have ad- ditiveorsynergisticeffectsandmoreeffectivepainrelief compared with single-modality interventions. For example, clinicians might offer local anesthetic-based regional (peripheral and neuraxial) analgesic techniques in combination with systemic opioids and other analge- sics as part of a multimodal approach to perioperative pain. Because of the availability of effective nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies for postop- erative pain management, the panel suggests that clini- cians routinely incorporate around the clock nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies into multi- modal analgesia regimens. Systemic opioids might not be required in all patients. One study suggests that it shouldbeavoidedwhennotneeded,becauselimitedev- idence suggests that perioperative opioid therapy might be associated with increased likelihood of long-term opioid use, with its attendant risks.4

The statewide assessments in mathematics, reading, and science are used to measure whether students, and their school and district, are meeting the academic standards. Statewide assessments are one measure of how well students are doing on the content that is part of their daily instruction. It is also a measure of how well schools and districts are doing in aligning their curriculum and teaching the standards.
6. Evaluating – can include commenting on the degrees of success and failure of something, or the value of something The ability to analyze and creatively adapt to new situations is at the heart of critical thinking. Paul and Elder (2008, 2014b) asserted that critical thinking provides a vehicle for educating the mind. John Dewey would agree, as from his early work, we have increased our sense of the pragmatic basis of human thought (its instrumental nature), and especially its grounding in actual human purposes, goals, and objectives. Dewey (1910) also discussed critical thinking in terms of reflective thinking, which is an uneasiness in accepting the status quo and that critical thinking is both an emotional and intellectual component. Students must, therefore, be taught to examine, poke, question, and reflect on what they have learned. Scepticism, questioning, and reflection is essential. Dewey also stated that schools should have an intimate relationship with the community it serves. From the review of the research concerning critical thinking and what components are considered important in high school education and later a life-long learning skill, the authors developed a 5-step, critical thinking teaching process as outlined in Table 2. Input from the study’s nine experts who reviewed the model and from suggestions from other model developers, led to the selection of easy to remember letters that describe each step’s process.

Of note, mice under single or combined metformin treatments showed an extended survival, whereas 84% of the nontreat- ed mice succumbed within 1 week after infection (Table 1). In conclusion, metformin treatment in combi- nation with suboptimal dosage of conventional antimalarials is more efficacious in reducing parasite load.

of the weakest links in the system. A study in Malawi revealed that the condition of many seriously ill children arriving at clinicshadnotpreviouslybeenrecognized.Insteadofreceiving immediate emergency care they were kept waiting for long periods before being given proper treatment. This resulted in avoidable deaths and disability (28). In Mexico, verbal autopsies of 132 children who died revealed that the majority had been seen by a physician within three days of death. Poor selection of medications and late referral to tertiary care were judged to be important contributory factors in more than half the deaths (29). A qualitative study of 21 hospitals in seven developing countries found that poor triage of incoming patients and inadequate provision of emergency care jeopar- dized the lives of arriving patients (30). Fourteen of the facilities (including 10 of 13 district hospitals) did not have an adequate triage system. A comprehensive review of the management of 131 children treated at these facilities found evidenceofinappropriateordelayedtriagein8%ofcases,poor clinical assessments in 41%, and potentially harmful delays in treatment in 19%. Several international health projects aimed at improving initial triage and treatment have been instituted at district health care facilities. Most focus on the strengthening of maternal and child health. One such project produced guidelines for emergency triage and treatment (28). An evaluation of these guidelines demonstrated that they significantly decreased the time required to assess children in need of urgent medical attention (31). In Sierra Leone a health care facility was upgraded in order to enhance its ability to provide prompt medical and surgicaltreatmenttowomenwithcomplicationsofpregnancy.

Participants agreed that some RA, even with good data and interesting results, will be rejected if the style and format of the paper are not tailored for the audience. This agrees with the results of investigations among 116 editors (Gosden, 1992; Fig. 1), who identified following most frequent causes to reject an L2 author: unclear text, incoherent development of the topic in paragraphs and incorrect use of grammar. In addition, the participants analysed an exemplary flawed paper by unknown author and decided to reject it after some discussion. The list of reasons for rejection can be seen in Table 1.

industry for anti-infectives overall, and significantly better than for other therapeutic areas, such as neurol- ogy and oncology. One difficulty with such an analysis is that new chemotypes have an inherently higher risk than additional members of established chemical classes, other than the risks of failure due to resistance (which are higher for drugs that have been used for many years). For this review’s new analysis (Table 8), new chemotypes are separated from life-cycle management projects. The overall success rates have not changed significantly in the last 3 years, either for MMV or for the CMR benchmark, which is reassuring. The data shows that a new molecule in formal preclinical evaluation has an 8% chance of becoming part of a product.

In this paper, we describe a novel feature space designed to effectively classify the polarity and strength of relationships extracted from biomedical abstracts. In addition to the conventional syntactic features such as unigrams and bigrams, we have also explored and constructed semantics-based sequential features. These features are constructed at three different levels: entity, phrase, and sentence. A wrapper-based method is then used to select the optimal feature sets for both polarity and strength prediction. Specifically, a multi-stage SVM classifier and an SVR predictor are built for polarity and strength prediction, respectively. Two different schemas, namely, (1 vs. all) and (2 vs. 2), are employed to build the multi-stage SVM. Finally, three different kernel functions are considered at different stage of this SVM classifier. Our intensive evaluations have shown that for polarity prediction, the (2 vs. 2) schema in general works better than the (1 vs. all). It produces the highest polarity accuracy of 0.91 when both unigrams and semantics-based sequential structures (KSS) are used, with a standard error ranging between 0.01~0.02. On the other hand, we find that for strength prediction, unigrams solely can produce satisfying results. We obtain a high accuracy of 0.96, with the standard error ranging between 0.61%~0.63% for the strength analysis. We are currently expanding our annotated corpus to facilitate further validation of the findings reported in this work. We are also integrating this module with other modules as shown in Figure 1 towards building a quantitative food-disease-gene network. Finally, we are creating an interactive user interface to visually present this network.

of care data [ 12 ] . The NCI estimate for expenditure on prostate cancer treatment in 2006 was $9.862 billion, and average Medicare payments per patient in the fi rst year after diagnosis were $11 000. It should be noted when interpreting this data that use of PSA testing for prostate cancer is more widespread in the USA than in many other countries, thus increasing the number of cases identifi ed. In addition, Medicare did not cover certain cancer care expenses such as oral medicines, commonly used to treat prostate cancer until January 2006. These out-of-pocket costs may comprise 10% of the $11 000 estimate. Direct medical expenditures are only one part of the total economic burden of cancer, as cancer- related illnesses and death lead to losses in economic productivity.

• Mood disturbances and cognitive difficulties. Complaints of irritability, loss of interest, mild depression and anxi- ety are common among insomnia patients. Patients with chronic insomnia often complain of mental inefficiency, difficulty remembering, difficulty focusing attention, and difficulty with complex mental tasks. • Quality of life: The irritability and fatigue associated with insomnia may cause interpersonal difficulties for insomnia patients, or avoidance of such activities. Conversely, in- terpersonal difficulties may be an important contributor to insomnia problems for some individuals. Sleep and wak- ing problems may lead to restriction of daytime activities, including social events, exercise, or work. Lack of regular daytime activities and exercise may in turn contribute to insomnia. • Exacerbation of comorbid conditions. Comorbid condi- tions may cause or increase sleep difficulties. Likewise, poor sleep may exacerbate symptomatology of comorbid conditions. Sleep complaints may herald the onset of mood disorders or exacerbation of comorbid conditions. VI. Other History: A complete insomnia history also in- cludes medical, psychiatric, medication/substance, and family/ social/occupational histories. A wide range of medical (Table 5) and psychiatric (Table 6) conditions can be comorbid with
changes in clinical status. Reassessments might be per- formed less frequently for patients with more stable pain (eg, patients who have exhibited good pain con- trol without side effects after 24 hours of stable ther- apy). Pain reassessments might be useful at the time of nursing shift changes or with new caregivers to establish a baseline and promote continuity of care, although evidence showing that routine reassessment of pain at nursing shift changes is associated with improved clinical outcomes is not available.

Proper Sizing-Firebox dimensions should be selected so that the fire fills the combustion chamber during operation. This provides greater heating efficiency. Careful consideration should be given to size of the fireplace opening best suited for the room in which it is to be located. Location and size are important not only from the standpoint of appearance, but also of operation. If the fireplace opening is too small, it may function properly but will not produce enough heat to warm the room. If the opening is too large, a fire that would fill the combustion chamber may overwhelm the room. In such a case, the firebox opening would require a larger flue area and consume larger amounts of interior air even if exterior combustion air is provided. Table 2 provides suggested widths of conventional fireplace openings appropriate for various room sizes. For example, a room with 300 ft2 (28 m2) of floor area is best served by a fireplace with an opening 30 in. (750 mm) to 36 in. (900 mm) wide.

The IOM report supports these findings, stating that diagnostic errors contribute to 10% of patient deaths and 6-17% of hospital adverse events. Other researchers quantify the human cost of diagnostic errors at between 40,000 and 80,000 deaths per year.9 These troubling findings make developing effective methods to prevent diagnostic errors an urgent priority.

In the absence of financial support from governments, the treatment costs presented in Table 4.3 would not be affordable to individual patients. For example, a course of standard (adjuvant) treatment for early stage HER2 positive breast cancer (Adjuvant AC-TH) would cost about 10 years of average annual wages in India and South Africa, and 1.7 years in the USAxx. Patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in India, South Africa and the USA would require, respectively, 3.7 years, 5.6 years and 1.1 years of wages to cover for the costs of a
The increase in full-text downloads for open access articles during their first year after publication suggests that the primary benefit to the nonsubscriber commu- nity is in browsing, as opposed to printing or saving, which would have been indicated by a commensurate increase in PDF downloads. The decrease in abstract views suggests a reader preference for the full docu- ment when available.
The naïve interpretation of this is that no more than 13 candidate compounds would be needed for a reasonable chance of launching one new medicine, and 25 for a com- bination with two NCEs (new chemical entities). How- ever, if one aims for a 90% overall chance of success (P), the number of candidates n, each with a success probabil- ity s (8%) is described by the negative binomial distribu- tion in Eq. 1.

Parasitemia is determined microscopically by counting 4 fields of approximately 100 erythrocytes per field. For low parasitemias (&lt;1%), up to 4000 erythrocytes have to be counted. Alternatively the parasitemia can also be determined by FACS analysis, which works particularly well for parasitemias &gt;1%.

What is the purpose of a RA and what makes it a good one, and who decides that it is a good RA? Are there rules for easier writing? If the main function of a RA is to transfer a new knowledge on a research topic, then a good paper is the one that is clear, coherent, focused, well argued and uses language that does not have ambiguous or equivoque meaning. However, it is not only the message that is important. The RA must have a well-defined structure and function in serve like a cook-book, so the others can reproduce and repeat explained experiments. Answer research questions Give summary conclusions There are some rules that can make the writing and publishing of RAs 'easier'. Here, we summarised some 'golden' rules that should always be in the mind of an inexperienced researcher (Table 3). We put all these together to make a final list of some 40 logical steps, which can be find in the Appendix.

Sleep-inducing drugs (hypnotics) are medications specif- ically designed to induce sleepiness directly after intake. Optimal agents affect cognitive performance during this period while inducing minimal sleepiness in the waking day after use. An optimal hypnotic would have low tox- icity and addictive potential, as well a minimal side effect profile (Oswald 1970). Among the first hypnotics, and an agent still in use is chloral hydrate - the original “Mickey Finn” - slipped into the drinks of unsuspecting marks for the purposes of criminal activity. Unfortu- nately, this medication is difficult to use since the LD-50 (potentially fatal dose) is quite close to the therapeutic dose. In the years leading up to the 1970’s, rapidly acting barbiturates were commonly utilized for their hypnotic effects. Unfortunately, these medications, also drugs of abuse, had a significant danger of overdose and contrib- uted to an era that was characterized in part by deaths due to overdoses of sleeping pills. These medications and similar barbiturate-like medications [Methaqualone (Quaalude, Sopor) Glutethimide (Doriden), Ethchlor- vynol (Placidyl), Methyprylon (Nodudar)] have limited availability and are rarely used due to limited efficacy, cognitive effects, the potential for abuse and lethal tox- icity associated with overdose (Oswald 1970). Today their primary therapeutic uses include executions and fa- cilitated euthanasia (Lossignol 2008). Most currently utilized hypnotics affect the widely dis- persed negative neurotransmitter GABA. In the 1970’s benzodiazepines (GABA agonists) were first marketed as hypnotics. Some of these agents had an extremely short duration of action [Triazolam (Halcion)]. While this agent-induced minimal next day somnolence, use was as- sociated with daytime memory impairment, particularly at higher dosages (Roehrs et al. 2000; Adam and Oswald

The IOM report supports these findings, stating that diagnostic errors contribute to 10% of patient deaths and 6-17% of hospital adverse events. Other researchers quantify the human cost of diagnostic errors at between 40,000 and 80,000 deaths per year.9 These troubling findings make developing effective methods to prevent diagnostic errors an urgent priority.

Participants agreed that some RA, even with good data and interesting results, will be rejected if the style and format of the paper are not tailored for the audience. This agrees with the results of investigations among 116 editors (Gosden, 1992; Fig. 1), who identified following most frequent causes to reject an L2 author: unclear text, incoherent development of the topic in paragraphs and incorrect use of grammar. In addition, the participants analysed an exemplary flawed paper by unknown author and decided to reject it after some discussion. The list of reasons for rejection can be seen in Table 1.

Phase 1. The aim of Phase 1 was to identify the contributions of clinical and laboratory variables that in practice were the most predictive of the decision to initiate DMARD therapy in a population of patients with early undifferentiated synovitis. Initiation of DMARD therapy was used as an indicator of the physician’s opinion that the patient was at risk of developing persistent and/or erosive arthritis that we would currently consider to be RA. Data on 3,115 patients from 9 early arthritis cohorts who were consid- ered not to have evidence of another possible diagnosis explaining their presentation were obtained. Between July 2007 and November 2008 an expert working group developed an analysis strategy that related an agreed- upon list of standardized clinical and laboratory vari- ables collected at baseline to the initiation of DMARD treatment within the next 12 months. MTX initiation was used as the gold standard for this purpose. The analytical process aimed to identify the independent contribution of each variable on this list and included univariate regression modeling, a subsequent principal components analysis, and a multivariate regression model that included all identified components (25). The resulting list of informative variables identified during that process and the weights based on the odds ratios are shown in Table 1. Phase 2. Phase 2 consisted of a consensus-based, decision science–informed approach, which took place between November 2008 and June 2009. The purpose of this phase was to derive a clinician-based judgment on

ability to sleep and the daytime consequences of poor sleep, dis- torted beliefs and attitudes about the origins and meaning of the insomnia, maladaptive efforts to accommodate to the condition (e.g., schedule or lifestyle changes), and excessive time spent awake in bed. The latter behavior is of particular significance in that it often is associated with “trying hard” to fall asleep and growing frustration and tension in the face of wakefulness. Thus, the bed becomes associated with a state of waking arousal as this conditioning paradigm repeats itself night after night.

Based on the size of the flue selected, a preliminary damper size must be assumed. At this point in the design process, it is only necessary to decide if the damper throat area to be used will be equal to or twice the flue area. Once this decision has been made the Inlet Loss Coefficient, K 2, may be determined. If the damper throat area is equal to the flue area, K 2 is equal to 2.5. If the damper throat is twice the flue area, K 2 is equal to 1.0.

In areas where malaria is prevalent, clinical diagnosis usually results in all patients with fever and no apparent other cause being treated for malaria. This approach can iden- tify most patients who truly need antimalarial treat- ment, but it is also likely to misclassify many who do not (15). Over-diagnosis can be considerable and contributes to misuse of antimalarial drugs. Considerable overlap exists between the signs and

We used an expert provided list of 42 relevant domain terms for the Myocardial Perfusion Imaging domain (a sub-domain of nuclear cardiology) to heuristically test the coverage of our ontology terms. Of these, we found 31 exactly matching terms, 2 morphological variants and 8 phrases that contained the terms from the expert list. Out of this 42 domain terms, 1 term, ‘dyperidamole’, was not found in our ontology (dyperidamole is a drug given during pregnancy). We found that this term didn’t exist in the 618 JNC abstracts we were using. Instead, another term, diperidamole (spelling variant) existed in our term list. To do away with noise in our data, we selected terms with greater than average frequency (2.9) of the 10191 retrieved terms and set that as our threshold. We pruned the list to

(cid:2) The panel recommends that clinicians offer multi- modal analgesia, or the use of a variety of analgesic medications and techniques combined with non- pharmacological interventions, for the treatment of postoperative pain in children and adults (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Multimodal analgesia, defined as the use of a variety of analgesic medication and techniques that target different mechanisms of action in the peripheral and/or central nervous system (which might also be combined with nonpharmacological interventions) might have ad- ditiveorsynergisticeffectsandmoreeffectivepainrelief compared with single-modality interventions. For example, clinicians might offer local anesthetic-based regional (peripheral and neuraxial) analgesic techniques in combination with systemic opioids and other analge- sics as part of a multimodal approach to perioperative pain. Because of the availability of effective nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies for postop- erative pain management, the panel suggests that clini- cians routinely incorporate around the clock nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies into multi- modal analgesia regimens. Systemic opioids might not be required in all patients. One study suggests that it shouldbeavoidedwhennotneeded,becauselimitedev- idence suggests that perioperative opioid therapy might be associated with increased likelihood of long-term opioid use, with its attendant risks.4

•Representante Legal: É aquele que por lei ou declaração judicial está autorizado a contrair direitos e obrigações em nome de um terceiro. De acordo com o Código Civil Brasileiro Art. 1.690, compete aos pais, e na falta de um deles ao outro, com exclusividade, representar os filhos menores de dezesseis anos, bem como assis�-los até a maioridade (com o falecimento dos pais, ou sendo estes julgados ausentes, ou em caso de os pais decaírem do poder familiar, compe�rá ao tutor legal representar o menor até os dezesseis anos e assis�-lo após essa idade - Código Civil Brasileiro Art. 1.747). Dessa maneira, no caso de um paciente menor, caso este seja menor de 16 anos, apenas o representante deverá assinar este termo (“representação”). Já, caso o paciente seja maior de 16 e menor de 18, tanto o representante legal, quanto o paciente, deverão assinar este termo (“assistência”).

Recent analyses of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)- Medicare database tracked healthcare use and costs (projected to 2004 levels) from diagnosis and initial treatment [ 15 ] , in addition to a 4-year follow-up [ 17 ] , for a cohort of 81 659 elderly patients with prostate cancer who had Medicare claims from 1991 to 2003 [ 15 ] , and 1991 to 2004 [ 17 ] , respectively. Treatment in the fi rst year after diagnosis was calculated to incur costs of $21 040 per patient; $13 091 for prostate cancer-related costs and $7949 for medical costs unrelated to prostate cancer [ 15 ] . In terms of cost at each stage, as expected, there was an increase in costs from stage I to IV [ 15,17 ] . Prostate cancer-related costs over 4 years from diagnosis averaged $18 168 per patient [ 17 ] . The annual healthcare cost burden estimated in 2009 is &gt; $2.5 billion annually for initial care alone [ 17 ] .

Insomnia occurs in individuals of all ages and races, and has been observed across all cultures and countries.8,9 The actual prevalence of insomnia varies according to the stringency of the definition used. Insomnia symptoms occur in approximately 33% to 50% of the adult population; insomnia symptoms with dis- tress or impairment (i.e., general insomnia disorder) in 10% to 15%; and specific insomnia disorders in 5% to 10%.10 Consis- tent risk factors for insomnia include increasing age, female sex, comorbid (medical, psychiatric, sleep, and substance use) disor- ders, shift work, and possibly unemployment and lower socio- economic status. Patients with comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions are at particularly increased risk, with psychiatric and chronic pain disorders having insomnia rates as high as 50% to 75%.11-13 The risk relationship between insomnia and psychiatric disorders appears to be bidirectional; several studies have also

The strength and moisture penetration resistance of a brick masonry cavity wall are affected by the mortar selection and compatibility with the brick units. Portland cement-lime, mortar cement, or masonry cement mortars can be used. However, mortars with an air content less than 12 percent are recommended for their superior bond strength and resistance to moisture penetration. The MSJC Code requires that the allowable flexural tensile stresses be reduced by approximately 50 percent for assemblies constructed with masonry cement mortars or portland cement-lime mortars that have air entrainment. In addition, some building codes prohibit the use of masonry cement mortars and all Type N mortars in Seismic Performance Categories D and E (formerly Seismic Zones 3 and 4). Mortar should meet the proportion requirements of ASTM C 270 Specification for Mortar for Unit Masonry as shown in Table 1. Mortar type selection should be based on project requirements, such as strength and compatibility with a particular brick unit. Types N or S mortars are typically used in brick masonry cavity walls. See Technical Notes 8 Series for more detailed information on mortar types and selection.

With some variation over time and across cancer types, care for the cancer population involves the six categories of services analyzed. The bars in Figures 2a-2c indicate that some patients had significant use of facility services in the year preceding the cancer diagnosis. For both colorectal and lung cancers, total spending on hospital inpatient increased as a percentage of total immediately following diagnosis. In all three cancers, the chemotherapy share of total spending increased rapidly in the first few months after diagnosis and, with the exception of breast cancer, continued at a fairly consistent level of around 20% of spending in subsequent years. Radiation therapy represented a small share of total spending except for breast cancer patients in the year following diagnosis.

6. Identify the efflorescence. Knowing the composition of efflorescing salts is sometimes of use. Table 1, taken from Brownell’s report lists the most probable sources of efflorescing salts. Commercial testing laboratories can use X-ray diffraction, petrographic analysis or chemical analysis can, in some instances, determine both the type of salts present and their relative quantity. 7. Consider miscellaneous sources of water when all obvious sources have been eliminated. Some of these sources are: condensation within the wall, poorly directed landscape sprinklers, leaky pipes, faulty drains and condensation on heating or plumbing pipes. If necessary, condensation analysis methods are described in Technical Note 47.

of care data [ 12 ] . The NCI estimate for expenditure on prostate cancer treatment in 2006 was $9.862 billion, and average Medicare payments per patient in the fi rst year after diagnosis were $11 000. It should be noted when interpreting this data that use of PSA testing for prostate cancer is more widespread in the USA than in many other countries, thus increasing the number of cases identifi ed. In addition, Medicare did not cover certain cancer care expenses such as oral medicines, commonly used to treat prostate cancer until January 2006. These out-of-pocket costs may comprise 10% of the $11 000 estimate. Direct medical expenditures are only one part of the total economic burden of cancer, as cancer- related illnesses and death lead to losses in economic productivity.

Insomnia occurs in individuals of all ages and races, and has been observed across all cultures and countries.8,9 The actual prevalence of insomnia varies according to the stringency of the definition used. Insomnia symptoms occur in approximately 33% to 50% of the adult population; insomnia symptoms with dis- tress or impairment (i.e., general insomnia disorder) in 10% to 15%; and specific insomnia disorders in 5% to 10%.10 Consis- tent risk factors for insomnia include increasing age, female sex, comorbid (medical, psychiatric, sleep, and substance use) disor- ders, shift work, and possibly unemployment and lower socio- economic status. Patients with comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions are at particularly increased risk, with psychiatric and chronic pain disorders having insomnia rates as high as 50% to 75%.11-13 The risk relationship between insomnia and psychiatric disorders appears to be bidirectional; several studies have also
In addition to return to learning and sporting environments, older athletes may need to return to driving, where subtle defi- cits could compromise safety. Most sports medicine physicians do not counsel athletes with SRC about driving.90 Driving is a complex process involving coordination of cognitive, visual and motor skills, as well as concentration, attention, visual percep- tion, insight and memory, which can all be affected by SRC.90 Little is known about the risk of driving after SRC, but prelim- inary data suggest some impairment exists when patients with concussion report they are asymptomatic.91 Currently, no widely
return-to-sport progression is individualised and is a function of the injury, the athlete’s age, prior SRC and level of play, and the ability to provide close supervision during the return to activity. The return-to-sport progression presented by the CISG is widely accepted but empiric, without evidence to support either the progression sequence or the time spent in each stage. In general, for young athletes, each stage of the progression should be at least 24 hours without return of symptoms before progressing to the next stage. (C)
Dose ranging test: Here, compounds are tested at a minimum of 4 different doses (the “dose ranging, full 4-day test”, typically 100, 30, 10 and 3 mg/kg, by both s.c. and p.o. routes of administration). ED 50 and ED 90 values are calculated by plotting the log dose against probit activity (for example, using Microcal “Origin”). These reflect the drug concentrations at which 50% and 90% of suppression of parasitemia is achieved. Note that with short half-life drugs it may be necessary to dose multiple times per day. Two other parameters measured in this study are relative potency compared to an appropriate standard drug, and oral bioavailability (assessed by comparison of oral and parenteral administration).

O ceratocone, a degeneração marginal pelúcida e ectasia pós-cirurgia refrativa são doenças que causam afilamento e abaulamento da córnea (estrutura transparente que forma a parede anterior do globo ocular). Estas alterações provocam astigmatismo irregular com distorção visual importante. O grau de embaçamento visual vai depender do grau de astigmatismo produzido e da existência de outras alterações oculares associadas. Astigmatismo pós-transplante de córnea é um grau residual que ocorre dependendo da intera- ção entre córnea doada e receptor (coaptação, cicatrização, abertura e frouxidão de pontos no decorrer da cicatrização e sua retirada).

Incidence numbers (column 2 = total, columns 3-7 = stages 0-IV, column 8 = stage unknown or “?”, for each row columns 3 through 8 add up to column 2), incidence rates in % for stages 0-IV and stage unknown (columns 9-13 = stages 0-IV, column 14 = stage unknown, for each row columns 9 through 14 add up to 100% up to rounding to 2 digits), and incidence rates for stages I-IV only with stage 0 and stage unknown specifically excluded (columns 15-18 = stages I-IV, for each row columns 15 through 18 add up to 100% up to rounding to 2 digits). The incidence numbers are based on the data for California adults aged 20 and older diagnosed with the cancers listed in column 1 during 2005-2009 as reported in [Morris et al, 2013]. Some cancer sites in column 1 are abbreviated as follows: Breast = female breast, Cervix = cervix uteri, Rectum = rectum and rectosigmoid junction, Kidney = kidney and renal pelvis, liver = liver and intrahepatic bile ducts, Lung = lung and bronchus, Melanoma = melanoma of the skin, Oral = oral cavity and pharynx, Bladder = urinary bladder, Uterine = uterine corpus. For Bladder, stage I includes stage 0 (stage I = stage 0/I).

Objectives of Phase 3. In Phase 3 the working group integrated the findings of the first 2 phases, refined the scoring system, and determined the optimal cut point to define “definite RA.” The goal of this final phase was to utilize the results of Phases 1 and 2 to develop a scoring system that would be applicable to newly presenting patients with undifferentiated inflam- matory arthritis to permit identification of those with a high probability of developing persistent and/or erosive RA. Being intended for use with newly presenting patients, the scoring system should be robust enough that it could be applied repeatedly during the early course of disease, such that a patient identified as not classifiable as having definite RA at initial presentation might be classified as having definite RA at a subsequent time point. The work was not aimed at classifying subjects with established disease, either active or inac- tive. However, the working group recognized that pa- tients may present for the first time with disease that is at a later stage and being treated. Thus, although it was not the explicit charge of the working group to provide

Reassessments might be per- formed less frequently for patients with more stable pain (eg, patients who have exhibited good pain con- trol without side effects after 24 hours of stable ther- apy). Pain reassessments might be useful at the time of nursing shift changes or with new caregivers to establish a baseline and promote continuity of care, although evidence showing that routine reassessment of pain at nursing shift changes is associated with improved clinical outcomes is not available.

•Representante Legal: É aquele que por lei ou declaração judicial está autorizado a contrair direitos e obrigações em nome de um terceiro. De acordo com o Código Civil Brasileiro Art. 1.690, compete aos pais, e na falta de um deles ao outro, com exclusividade, representar os filhos menores de dezesseis anos, bem como assis�-los até a maioridade (com o falecimento dos pais, ou sendo estes julgados ausentes, ou em caso de os pais decaírem do poder familiar, compe�rá ao tutor legal representar o menor até os dezesseis anos e assis�-lo após essa idade - Código Civil Brasileiro Art. 1.747). Dessa maneira, no caso de um paciente menor, caso este seja menor de 16 anos, apenas o representante deverá assinar este termo (“representação”). Já, caso o paciente seja maior de 16 e menor de 18, tanto o representante legal, quanto o paciente, deverão assinar este termo (“assistência”).
The analysis found that low-income countries could spend on average up to US$ 3800 per cancer patient annually on cancer medicines for all newly-diagnosed cancer patients, and the total expenditure on these medicines would be within the generously assumed 5% of the total health expenditure (Table 4.2). In high- income countries, the analysis found that a budget threshold of 5% of the total health expenditure would allow a spending of up to US$ 40 600 on cancer medicines per patient per year, with a view to providing universal coverage.

ability to sleep and the daytime consequences of poor sleep, dis- torted beliefs and attitudes about the origins and meaning of the insomnia, maladaptive efforts to accommodate to the condition (e.g., schedule or lifestyle changes), and excessive time spent awake in bed. The latter behavior is of particular significance in that it often is associated with “trying hard” to fall asleep and growing frustration and tension in the face of wakefulness. Thus, the bed becomes associated with a state of waking arousal as this conditioning paradigm repeats itself night after night.

Participants also discovered that all RAS's can be separated in subsections or signposts, which can be arbitrary, but improve the structure of a RA. The recognized subsections were: research topic and definitions, research objectives (questions), methodological techniques, experimental set-up, object of the study (e.g. study area), main discoveries (analysed data), answers on research questions, explanation of the conclusions and further research and implications. The main RAS's are listed in a flow chart, showing main relations between different sections (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 shows the substructure of Introduction and Discussion RAS as the most important RAS's.

Numerous alternative beta blockers are available in lieu of propranolol. Notable among these is the common drug, atenolol, that is available in oral solid dose forms ranging from 25 to 100 mg for the treatment of hypertension. Multiple doses per day may be permitted. It has been used to suppress stage fright in performers when administered orally in advance [45]. Atenolol is a beta-1 selective peripheral-acting agent without CNS effects, which should reduce the risk for asthmatic subjects [46]. Thus, atenolol might be preferred over the nonselective beta blockers for patients affected by asthma or COPD [47]. Oral atenolol at 50 - 200 mg doses suppressed heart rate by ~ 23 - 24 beats per minute (bpm) vs. ~ 10 bpm on placebo [46]. Also,

There are debates about whether the returns generated from the sales of medicines, including cancer medicines, are sufficient for pharmaceutical companies to cover their past R&amp;D expenses, maintain their operations and engage in future drug discovery research. For example, some commentators have observed that the revenue generated from the sales of imatinib had exceeded the costs of R&amp;D within two years and “the revenues over the subsequent years of the patent would represent generous profits to the company” (30). Another study found that total revenue from the sales of 10 cancer medicines since approval over a median of four years (US$ 67.0 billion) was 9.3 times the total R&amp;D spending of US$ 7.2 billion (or 7.4 times using an estimated risk-adjusted R&amp;D costs of US$ 9.1 billion) (94).

(cid:2) The panel recommends that clinicians offer multi- modal analgesia, or the use of a variety of analgesic medications and techniques combined with non- pharmacological interventions, for the treatment of postoperative pain in children and adults (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Multimodal analgesia, defined as the use of a variety of analgesic medication and techniques that target different mechanisms of action in the peripheral and/or central nervous system (which might also be combined with nonpharmacological interventions) might have ad- ditiveorsynergisticeffectsandmoreeffectivepainrelief compared with single-modality interventions. For example, clinicians might offer local anesthetic-based regional (peripheral and neuraxial) analgesic techniques in combination with systemic opioids and other analge- sics as part of a multimodal approach to perioperative pain. Because of the availability of effective nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies for postop- erative pain management, the panel suggests that clini- cians routinely incorporate around the clock nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies into multi- modal analgesia regimens. Systemic opioids might not be required in all patients. One study suggests that it shouldbeavoidedwhennotneeded,becauselimitedev- idence suggests that perioperative opioid therapy might be associated with increased likelihood of long-term opioid use, with its attendant risks.4
Summary of C57BL/6 mice infected with GFP-expressing P. berghei sporozoites and treated with metformin, primaquine, and mefloquine, alone or in combination as described in Figures 1 and 3. Prepatency was determined by detecting the presence of GFP+ red blood cells via flow cytometry analysis. The number of mice carrying parasites on days 3 (72 hours) and 5 after sporozoite injection is shown. The total number of infected mice is given in parentheses. The number of mice alive on day 10 is also shown.

AASM practice parameter papers are based on evidence- based review and grading of literature, often addressing a spe- cific issue or topic. Clinical guidelines provide clinicians with a working overview for disease or disorder evaluation and man- agement. These guidelines include practice parameter papers and also include areas with limited evidence in order to provide a comprehensive practice guideline. Both practice parameters and clinical guidelines define principles of practice that should meet the needs of most patients. They should not, however, be considered exhaustive, inclusive of all available methods of care, or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably expected to obtain the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding appropriateness of any specific therapy must be made by the clinician and patient in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible

1989). In the 1990’s newer agents were developed and marketed that had selective effects on GABA receptors in- cluding Zolpidem (Ambien), Zaleplon (Sonata), Eszopi- clone (Estorra) and Indiplon. While all hypnotics have abuse potential for individuals with addictive histories and personalities, these agents have been noted to have min- imal additive potential (Hajak et al. 2003). These agents are less likely to have deleterious side effects than most OTC treatments for insomnia, however, with increased use, more side effects including next effects on driving have been reported. This effect as well as next day re- bound insomnia has particularly been reported for higher doses of zolpidem (Verster et al. 2002). In many cases, MVA’s occurred in the period of somnolence and cogni- tive impairment during the first few hours after ingestion. Comparatively normal results on psychomotor tests can be obtained 3.25 h. after zaleplon ingestion and 6.25 h. after zopiclone ingestion (Paul et al. 2003). While these agents have excellent efficacy with minimal side effects, at higher doses these agents can exhibit benzodiazepine-like effects. Idiosyncratic reactions of persistent daytime som- nolence and/or memory loss have been reported. Some patients will report next day sedation after the nighttime use of these agents, as well as demonstrate an increased error rate in driving tests (Verster et al. 2007). Such infor- mation was forthcoming only after these drugs became generic and widely utilized in clinical practice. Most sedat- ing drugs if adopted into such widespread use would also be at least as likely to demonstrate epidemiological effects on MVA’s and MVA associated deaths. In the elderly, chronic use of sedating drugs (particularly those with anti-cholinergic side effects) can be associated with an increased risk for falls, and confusion (American Geriatrics Society 2015). Reported next day sleepiness and other side effects associated with hypnotic use are summarized in Table 3. The newer GABA-effective hypnotics are the only medications with demonstrated effectiveness in treating chronic insomnia (NIH State of the Science Conference

Dose ranging test: Here, compounds are tested at a minimum of 4 different doses (the “dose ranging, full 4-day test”, typically 100, 30, 10 and 3 mg/kg, by both s.c. and p.o. routes of administration). ED 50 and ED 90 values are calculated by plotting the log dose against probit activity (for example, using Microcal “Origin”). These reflect the drug concentrations at which 50% and 90% of suppression of parasitemia is achieved. Note that with short half-life drugs it may be necessary to dose multiple times per day. Two other parameters measured in this study are relative potency compared to an appropriate standard drug, and oral bioavailability (assessed by comparison of oral and parenteral administration).

Readership analysis was conducted on the 20 science journals in our data set (n(cid:1)2903). Articles published in the social sciences and humanities journals (n(cid:1)350) were omitted from the readership analysis, as many did not include abstract or full-text versions of their articles, and, in some cases, refer- ence views were added to full-text views, resulting in indeter- minate and incomparable results. Citation analyses were conducted on the entire article data set (n(cid:1)3245). A logistic regression model was used to estimate the likelihood of articles in each experimental group being cited within the first year after publication, controlling for journal and journal category effects.
During data extraction, interventions/exposures will be labelled using the exposure codes listed in the Guidelines for the search literature reviews of the 2007 WCRF/AICR expert Report1 . The interventions/exposures are allocated under the main headings and subheadings listed in Appendix 4. For example, diet modifications –e.g. diets rich in fruit and vegetables and low in fats- will be coded under “Dietary patterns” and combinations of micronutrients in supplements will be coded under “Dietary Constituents”.
medicine (NMM) and OMM obtain many more hundreds of hours of manual medicine training in a wider variety of clinical settings than DCs and other DOs. This section was meant to give you a better sense of what “osteopathic manipulative medicine” entails, and hopefully it answered most of your questions regarding OMM. The effectiveness of OMM remains a topic of ongoing debate and research despite past and current efforts to lay these arguments to rest. Whether an osteo- pathic physician uses OMM in his or her practice is based entirely on preference. With that said, it is an important core discipline and primary distinction of the osteopathic profession.

In summary, public and non-profit-making sectors, and by extension tax-payers and philanthropists, have provided considerable financial and non-financial contributions towards the R&amp;D of cancer medicines. This means that in many cases, pharmaceutical companies have not incurred the full costs of R&amp;D. The pharmaceutical industry has also benefited greatly from the knowledge generated by public-sector investments in R&amp;D, and by having access to research supported by public funding at costs, if any, lower than the market value.
somnolence as a side effect is reproducible in susceptible individuals (White and Rumbold 1988). Sedation is a com- mon side effect of the traditional antipsychotics, with chlorpromazine and thioridazine somewhat more sedating than haloperidol. Clinical studies have shown a high inci- dence of persistent sedation with clozapine (46%) with less frequent reports of sedation with risperidone, olanzapine, sertindole and quetiapine (Monti et al. 2016). The sed- ation associated with these agents is most likely associated with their known effects on histaminic receptors. Doxepin, a sedating psychotropic agent with pro- nounced histamine (H-1) receptor antagonism exerts at least part of its effects by antagonizing orexin (Krystal et al. 2013). Suvorexant, is an orexin antagonist designed to lower waking arousal (Norman and Anderson 2016). Currently, it is being heavily marketed as a hypnotic (Rhyne and Anderson 2015). As based on performance and driving tests, this agent is known to produce a dose-related next day increase in somnolence for all age groupings tested (Farkus 2013). Sedative drug effects on daytime sleepiness are summarized in Table 4.

Recent analyses of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)- Medicare database tracked healthcare use and costs (projected to 2004 levels) from diagnosis and initial treatment [ 15 ] , in addition to a 4-year follow-up [ 17 ] , for a cohort of 81 659 elderly patients with prostate cancer who had Medicare claims from 1991 to 2003 [ 15 ] , and 1991 to 2004 [ 17 ] , respectively. Treatment in the fi rst year after diagnosis was calculated to incur costs of $21 040 per patient; $13 091 for prostate cancer-related costs and $7949 for medical costs unrelated to prostate cancer [ 15 ] . In terms of cost at each stage, as expected, there was an increase in costs from stage I to IV [ 15,17 ] . Prostate cancer-related costs over 4 years from diagnosis averaged $18 168 per patient [ 17 ] . The annual healthcare cost burden estimated in 2009 is &gt; $2.5 billion annually for initial care alone [ 17 ] .

samples)) / (geometric mean cpm of no drug samples). Percentage reductions are used to plot percentage inhibition of growth as a function of drug concentrations. IC 50 values are determined by linear regression analyses on the linear segments of the curves (IC 90 values can also be determined by curve-fitting and can provide an useful measure of variation between experiments). Assays are typically repeated on two or three separate occasions. Within each experiment, standard deviations are typically less than 10% of the mean. Differences in parasite stages of development can lead to up to two-fold shifts in the IC 50 values between experiments; however, these differences rarely affect the overall relationships between the parasite lines in terms of their differences in drug response 4-11 .

We used an expert provided list of 42 relevant domain terms for the Myocardial Perfusion Imaging domain (a sub-domain of nuclear cardiology) to heuristically test the coverage of our ontology terms. Of these, we found 31 exactly matching terms, 2 morphological variants and 8 phrases that contained the terms from the expert list. Out of this 42 domain terms, 1 term, ‘dyperidamole’, was not found in our ontology (dyperidamole is a drug given during pregnancy). We found that this term didn’t exist in the 618 JNC abstracts we were using. Instead, another term, diperidamole (spelling variant) existed in our term list. To do away with noise in our data, we selected terms with greater than average frequency (2.9) of the 10191 retrieved terms and set that as our threshold. We pruned the list to

These assignment guidelines pertain exclusively to Commercial Mobile Radio Service providers (CMRS). The IMSI Administrator directly administers only the Home Network Identity (HNI) segment of the resource. The HNI uniquely identifies the home wireless network of a FCC- licensed two-way CMRS subscriber and contains the Mobile Country Code (MCC) and the Mobile Network Code (MNC). The remaining segment of the IMSI, the Mobile Station Identification Number (MSIN), is directly administered by the wireless network licensee to which the HNI is assigned. Issue: In 1998, ITU Recommendation E.212 was modified allowing IMSI assignments to those Wireline Service Providers offering limited mobility services. As a result, HNI assignments are no longer available exclusively to CMRS providers. The current IMSI assignment and administrative guidelines do not however reflect these modifications.

The IOM report supports these findings, stating that diagnostic errors contribute to 10% of patient deaths and 6-17% of hospital adverse events. Other researchers quantify the human cost of diagnostic errors at between 40,000 and 80,000 deaths per year.9 These troubling findings make developing effective methods to prevent diagnostic errors an urgent priority.

Profit control is an effective measure to manage medicine prices insofar as the regulators have control over the supply of medicines at certain points along the supply chain. Typically, this means that the regulator needs to have full visibility of the supply and distribution chains. The regulator also needs to have the capacity and ability to enforce non-compliance. Profit control is most effective when there is a publicly- funded universal programme for the provision of medicines. In contrast, it may be much less effective in health care settings where the private sector plays a significant role in the delivery of medicines, or where the structure of supply chain is complex or under-developed (183).

Numerous alternative beta blockers are available in lieu of propranolol. Notable among these is the common drug, atenolol, that is available in oral solid dose forms ranging from 25 to 100 mg for the treatment of hypertension. Multiple doses per day may be permitted. It has been used to suppress stage fright in performers when administered orally in advance [45]. Atenolol is a beta-1 selective peripheral-acting agent without CNS effects, which should reduce the risk for asthmatic subjects [46]. Thus, atenolol might be preferred over the nonselective beta blockers for patients affected by asthma or COPD [47]. Oral atenolol at 50 - 200 mg doses suppressed heart rate by ~ 23 - 24 beats per minute (bpm) vs. ~ 10 bpm on placebo [46]. Also,
O ceratocone, a degeneração marginal pelúcida e ectasia pós-cirurgia refrativa são doenças que causam afilamento e abaulamento da córnea (estrutura transparente que forma a parede anterior do globo ocular). Estas alterações provocam astigmatismo irregular com distorção visual importante. O grau de embaçamento visual vai depender do grau de astigmatismo produzido e da existência de outras alterações oculares associadas. Astigmatismo pós-transplante de córnea é um grau residual que ocorre dependendo da intera- ção entre córnea doada e receptor (coaptação, cicatrização, abertura e frouxidão de pontos no decorrer da cicatrização e sua retirada).

• Fatigue and sleepiness. Feelings of fatigue (low energy, physical tiredness, weariness) are more common than symptoms of sleepiness (actual tendency to fall asleep) in patients with chronic insomnia. The presence of significant sleepiness should prompt a search for other potential sleep disorders. The number, duration, and timing of naps should be thoroughly investigated, as both a consequence of in- somnia and a potential contributing factor.

The TSST method has been used to study the effects of oral propranolol in volunteer subjects [25-28]. The assessments of psychic anxiety can be assessed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) or other similar tools [29,30]. The somatic and psychic effects of oral propranolol were tested using the TSST method in healthy adult volunteers. Propranolol (40 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, reduced systolic blood pressure, and enhanced cognitive flexibility during stress. In another study propranolol (80 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, but paradoxically increased salivary cortisol, and did not significantly affect BP or subjective stress [25]. But, in another TSST study daily oral propranolol (80 mg) did not affect the salivary cortisol response [27].

A similar calculation is performed for each option. The resulting values for the near-term options are then summed and multiplied by 2/T 1. Likewise, the resulting values for the next-term options are summed and multiplied by 2/T 2. The table below summarizes the results for each strip of options.
1. Decide when to clean. Mortar must harden prior to cleaning. It is generally best to schedule cleaning at least seven days after brickwork is completed. In some cases it may be possible to clean earlier; how- ever, effects on the masonry and influencing factors such as weather conditions and the type of brick and mortar should be carefully considered. Prolonged time periods between the completion of the masonry and cleaning should be avoided. After one month, mortar smears and splatters left on brickwork become increasingly difficult to remove. 2. Remove larger clumps of mortar using wooden paddles or nonmetallic tools. Metal tools may damage the brickwork or leave behind fragments that oxidize and cause rust stains. 3. Select the proper cleaning solution. There are many types of proprietary cleaners available that are for- mulated to remove specific stains or for use with a particular type of brick. Be careful to select cleaning products suitable for the brick, mortar and adjacent materials and follow the cleaner manufacturer’s rec- ommended instructions. Each product being considered should be evaluated as discussed previously in Trial Cleaning.

Brick has been used to create beautiful buildings for centuries. Most of these structures have a substantial history of outstanding performance. In some instances the appearance is affected by the development of efflorescence or stains. These may originate from materials in the brick or mortar, from adjacent materials, and from outside sourc- es such as cleaning agents. Each has a particular chemical composition and a unique means of removal.
There are many, often complicated, mechanisms of efflorescence. Simply stated, efflorescence occurs when water containing dissolved salts is brought to the surface of masonry, the water evaporates and the salts are left on the surface of the masonry. The salt solutions may migrate across surfaces of masonry units, between the mortar and units, or through the pores of the mortar or units.

Insomnia occurs in individuals of all ages and races, and has been observed across all cultures and countries.8,9 The actual prevalence of insomnia varies according to the stringency of the definition used. Insomnia symptoms occur in approximately 33% to 50% of the adult population; insomnia symptoms with dis- tress or impairment (i.e., general insomnia disorder) in 10% to 15%; and specific insomnia disorders in 5% to 10%.10 Consis- tent risk factors for insomnia include increasing age, female sex, comorbid (medical, psychiatric, sleep, and substance use) disor- ders, shift work, and possibly unemployment and lower socio- economic status. Patients with comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions are at particularly increased risk, with psychiatric and chronic pain disorders having insomnia rates as high as 50% to 75%.11-13 The risk relationship between insomnia and psychiatric disorders appears to be bidirectional; several studies have also

Results from the tests showed that the average value of critical thinking ability to the average achievement after the testing ended, showed the relationship was statistically significant (.05). As a result, the researchers compared the results of Table 4 and determined that after the posttest, data showed the average of critical thinking ability and post-learning achievement were higher than before the study.
Wind turbines will be used to harness the kinetic energy of the moving air over the oceans on the OCS and convert it to electricity. Offshore winds are less turbulent (because the ocean is flat relative to onshore topography), and they tend to flow at higher speeds than onshore winds, thus allowing turbines to produce more electricity. Because the potential energy produced from the wind is directly proportional to the cube of the wind speed, increased wind speeds of only a few miles per hour can produce a significantly larger amount of electricity. For instance, a turbine at a site with an average wind speed of 16 mph would produce 50% more electricity than at a site with the same turbine and average wind speeds of 14 mph (Offshore Wind 2006).
1989). In the 1990’s newer agents were developed and marketed that had selective effects on GABA receptors in- cluding Zolpidem (Ambien), Zaleplon (Sonata), Eszopi- clone (Estorra) and Indiplon. While all hypnotics have abuse potential for individuals with addictive histories and personalities, these agents have been noted to have min- imal additive potential (Hajak et al. 2003). These agents are less likely to have deleterious side effects than most OTC treatments for insomnia, however, with increased use, more side effects including next effects on driving have been reported. This effect as well as next day re- bound insomnia has particularly been reported for higher doses of zolpidem (Verster et al. 2002). In many cases, MVA’s occurred in the period of somnolence and cogni- tive impairment during the first few hours after ingestion. Comparatively normal results on psychomotor tests can be obtained 3.25 h. after zaleplon ingestion and 6.25 h. after zopiclone ingestion (Paul et al. 2003). While these agents have excellent efficacy with minimal side effects, at higher doses these agents can exhibit benzodiazepine-like effects. Idiosyncratic reactions of persistent daytime som- nolence and/or memory loss have been reported. Some patients will report next day sedation after the nighttime use of these agents, as well as demonstrate an increased error rate in driving tests (Verster et al. 2007). Such infor- mation was forthcoming only after these drugs became generic and widely utilized in clinical practice. Most sedat- ing drugs if adopted into such widespread use would also be at least as likely to demonstrate epidemiological effects on MVA’s and MVA associated deaths. In the elderly, chronic use of sedating drugs (particularly those with anti-cholinergic side effects) can be associated with an increased risk for falls, and confusion (American Geriatrics Society 2015). Reported next day sleepiness and other side effects associated with hypnotic use are summarized in Table 3. The newer GABA-effective hypnotics are the only medications with demonstrated effectiveness in treating chronic insomnia (NIH State of the Science Conference

Composite or combination flashings are typically less expensive than sheet metal and are easier to install. The most predominant type is a thin layer of metal sandwiched between one or two layers of another material. The metal layer is usually of aluminum, copper or lead. It is covered on one or both sides with various materials, such as asphalt coatings, kraft paper, fiberglass fabric or plastic films. Product literature should be reviewed to determine whether these materials are appropriate for use in brick masonry cavity walls. Consideration should be given to compatibility with adjacent sealants, delamination due to moisture penetration and movement of the wall system.

Efflorescence is normally a harmless deposit of water- soluble, white salt crystals, as shown in Photo 1. In some instances efflorescence may appear on mortar joints as shown in Photo 2. Efflorescence may appear in limited areas on the surface of brickwork as shown in Photo 3 or, in extreme cases, cover the entire brickwork surface.

6. Evaluating – can include commenting on the degrees of success and failure of something, or the value of something The ability to analyze and creatively adapt to new situations is at the heart of critical thinking. Paul and Elder (2008, 2014b) asserted that critical thinking provides a vehicle for educating the mind. John Dewey would agree, as from his early work, we have increased our sense of the pragmatic basis of human thought (its instrumental nature), and especially its grounding in actual human purposes, goals, and objectives. Dewey (1910) also discussed critical thinking in terms of reflective thinking, which is an uneasiness in accepting the status quo and that critical thinking is both an emotional and intellectual component. Students must, therefore, be taught to examine, poke, question, and reflect on what they have learned. Scepticism, questioning, and reflection is essential. Dewey also stated that schools should have an intimate relationship with the community it serves. From the review of the research concerning critical thinking and what components are considered important in high school education and later a life-long learning skill, the authors developed a 5-step, critical thinking teaching process as outlined in Table 2. Input from the study’s nine experts who reviewed the model and from suggestions from other model developers, led to the selection of easy to remember letters that describe each step’s process.

The structural design of cavity walls should follow either rational or empirical methods. The rational design method is based on the properties of the wall materials and engineering analysis. This method may be used for any structure where high loads are likely or where tall walls are a necessity. The empirical method is generally satisfactory for one and two-story buildings consisting of light construction with limited floor spans and wall heights; and for multistory buildings where unsupported wall heights are not excessive.

the fact that 11 of the 12 medicines approved by the United States Food &amp; Drug Administration (US FDA) in 2012 for various cancer indications were priced above US$ 100 000 per year. The experts asserted that the prices of these medicines were too high, unsustainable, might compromise access of needy patients to highly effective therapy, and harmful to the sustainability of national health care systems (30). Similarly, in 2015, yet another group of cancer experts have petitioned for lower medicine prices (31).

considerable challenge in assessing, measuring and translating the value of a medicine to a price. In particular, there is no universally accepted view on what dimensions of value should be considered for the purpose of determining medicine prices. Fig. 3.8 (p.34) shows the various dimensions of value noted in the literature and government guidelines, summarized into eight themes. Common dimensions considered in health technology assessments are: clinical and public health needs for the proposed medicine, clinical evidence, economic and financial public health considerations.

Biomarkers of exposure will be extracted under the heading of the corresponding exposure, Biomarkers for which there is no evidence on appropriate validity and repeatability will not be included in the review (List of biomarkers is in Appendix 5).

For the (2 vs. 2) SVM schema, one can observe from Table 6 that the highest overall accuracy is 0.91 and generated by a feature combination of POS-based unigrams and K-array semantics-based sequential features, regardless of whether WordNet is used to correct the POS of a unigram or not. In terms of the kernel functions, a linear kernel is used at the first level of the SVM model and a polynomial kernel at the second level. In addition, we notice that the inclusion of bigrams (the last four rows in Table 6) does not improve accuracy but rather reduce the accuracy. This agrees with results reported in previous studies. Tables 7 and 8 present the confusion matrices resulted from the two best feature sets using the (2 vs. 2) SVM schema. These two tables elaborate the two optimal feature sets as highlighted in Table 6. Results are obtained by using a linear and a polynomial kernel at the two levels respectively and averaged over 10-fold cross validation. Notice that in certain cases, the model cannot ditinguish between positive and neutral polarities due to the reasons discussed above; while negative and no-relationship can often be correctly identified.

Participants agreed that some RA, even with good data and interesting results, will be rejected if the style and format of the paper are not tailored for the audience. This agrees with the results of investigations among 116 editors (Gosden, 1992; Fig. 1), who identified following most frequent causes to reject an L2 author: unclear text, incoherent development of the topic in paragraphs and incorrect use of grammar. In addition, the participants analysed an exemplary flawed paper by unknown author and decided to reject it after some discussion. The list of reasons for rejection can be seen in Table 1.

The use of two antimalarials simultaneously, especially when the antimalarials have different mechanisms of action, has the potential for inhib- iting the development of resistance to either of the components. The efficacy of a combination of a 4-aminoquinoline drug (either chloroquine or amo- diaquine) with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine has been reviewed (43). The results of this review sug- gested that the addition of either chloroquine or amodiaquine to SP marginally improved parasitological clearance (compared with SP alone). The studies reviewed were mostly done in areas and at times when both SP and chloroquine/amodi- aquine retained a fair amount of efficacy, and it is not clear from these studies how well such a combination would act in areas where one of the components was significantly compromised. Additionally, to date, there are no data to suggest whether this slightly improved clearance would

Your child has been identified as needing services for English Language Learners (ELL). Your child will be placed in the ESL/Bilingual Education dual language immersion program, as outlined in the attached document. We believe that this program will help meet your child’s educational needs and enhance his/her academic success in school. Your child will be assessed twice yearly, or as needed, to determine progress toward individual ELL goals. When your child scores in the acceptable range (4.5 Literacy/5.0 Overall) on all areas of the W-APT or ACCESS assessment they will be exited from the program. If your student currently has an Individualized Education Program (IEP), their needs will continue to be met through their current accommodations.
somnolence as a side effect is reproducible in susceptible individuals (White and Rumbold 1988). Sedation is a com- mon side effect of the traditional antipsychotics, with chlorpromazine and thioridazine somewhat more sedating than haloperidol. Clinical studies have shown a high inci- dence of persistent sedation with clozapine (46%) with less frequent reports of sedation with risperidone, olanzapine, sertindole and quetiapine (Monti et al. 2016). The sed- ation associated with these agents is most likely associated with their known effects on histaminic receptors. Doxepin, a sedating psychotropic agent with pro- nounced histamine (H-1) receptor antagonism exerts at least part of its effects by antagonizing orexin (Krystal et al. 2013). Suvorexant, is an orexin antagonist designed to lower waking arousal (Norman and Anderson 2016). Currently, it is being heavily marketed as a hypnotic (Rhyne and Anderson 2015). As based on performance and driving tests, this agent is known to produce a dose-related next day increase in somnolence for all age groupings tested (Farkus 2013). Sedative drug effects on daytime sleepiness are summarized in Table 4.

medicine (NMM) and OMM obtain many more hundreds of hours of manual medicine training in a wider variety of clinical settings than DCs and other DOs. This section was meant to give you a better sense of what “osteopathic manipulative medicine” entails, and hopefully it answered most of your questions regarding OMM. The effectiveness of OMM remains a topic of ongoing debate and research despite past and current efforts to lay these arguments to rest. Whether an osteo- pathic physician uses OMM in his or her practice is based entirely on preference. With that said, it is an important core discipline and primary distinction of the osteopathic profession.
the top 10. We also extract and treat as binary features four different types of subjects from Altmetric and CrossRef: Medline subject codes for journal (Altmetric), subjects as indexed by SCOPUS (Altmetric), publisher subjects (Altmetric), and CrossRef subjects. Subjects are mostly at the granularity of the journal or higher. Similar journals have subjects in com- mon, with, for instance, the journals Nature Conservation, Conservation Biology, Ecology and Evolution, and many more sharing the CrossRef subject “nature and landscape conservation.”Multidisciplinaryjournals,suchasPNASand Nature, are often tagged with more general subjects such as “science” or “multidisciplinary.” Table 2 displays the top 10 CrossRef subjects describing at least 100 articles by aver- age news coverage. As expected, health related subjects top the list, along with those related to the environment. Unfor- tunately, but as expected, “general computer science” and “computational mathematics” secured the last places, at 0.5 and 0.3 news articles on average, respectively. We also extract textual features, when available, for each document: Title, Abstract, Press Release. For scientific ar- ticles with more than one press release, we randomly select one. For each type of text document, we preprocess using a standard English stop word list, extracting counts of un- igrams and bigrams, keeping tokens which appear in more than one document and no more than 80% of documents of the same type in the training set. We keep the 30,000 most frequently occurring features in the training set. We then scale the vectors of counts by tfidf weights fit on the training set. Finally, we create a boolean feature hasPR indicating whether the scientific article received coverage on one of the two prominent press release aggregation websites, Eu- rekAlert! or Science Daily. We hypothesize that mention on one of these would expose the scientific article to more jour- nalists and thus garner more coverage.

In the late 1800s, Andrew Taylor Still identified the neuromusculoskeletal system as the key element in health maintenance and stressed preventive aspects of medi- cine in place of drug therapy. During that time, osteop- athy was truly separate and distinct from the world of allo- pathic medicine. Since then, as medicine in general has become more evidence-based and supported by research, osteopathic philosophy has evolved into a more complete and robust osteopathic medicine. The phrase “osteopathic medicine” is now the accepted term for the profession over “osteopathy,” a now-antiquated term that represents a period when Still championed a near-drugless form of manual medicine. Since its conception, osteopathic med- icine has adapted its body of knowledge to incorporate contemporary scientific thought, including germ theory, pharmacology, and other “allopathic” teachings. The cen- tral tenets of osteopathic thought, however, have been maintained and continue to guide DOs in their practice of medicine. Though interprofessional relations between MDs and DOs are better than they have ever been before, challenges still exist in terms of keeping the osteopathic tradition intact, improving the evidence basis of OMM via clinical research, and advocating for widespread recogni- tion of DOs.

The structural design of cavity walls should follow either rational or empirical methods. The rational design method is based on the properties of the wall materials and engineering analysis. This method may be used for any structure where high loads are likely or where tall walls are a necessity. The empirical method is generally satisfactory for one and two-story buildings consisting of light construction with limited floor spans and wall heights; and for multistory buildings where unsupported wall heights are not excessive.

Dose ranging test: Here, compounds are tested at a minimum of 4 different doses (the “dose ranging, full 4-day test”, typically 100, 30, 10 and 3 mg/kg, by both s.c. and p.o. routes of administration). ED 50 and ED 90 values are calculated by plotting the log dose against probit activity (for example, using Microcal “Origin”). These reflect the drug concentrations at which 50% and 90% of suppression of parasitemia is achieved. Note that with short half-life drugs it may be necessary to dose multiple times per day. Two other parameters measured in this study are relative potency compared to an appropriate standard drug, and oral bioavailability (assessed by comparison of oral and parenteral administration). However,
current PSG   and  self-reports, it can be presumptively diagnosed  on  clinical grounds alone.
• Mood disturbances and cognitive difficulties. Complaints of irritability, loss of interest, mild depression and anxi- ety are common among insomnia patients. Patients with chronic insomnia often complain of mental inefficiency, difficulty remembering, difficulty focusing attention, and difficulty with complex mental tasks. • Quality of life: The irritability and fatigue associated with insomnia may cause interpersonal difficulties for insomnia patients, or avoidance of such activities. Conversely, in- terpersonal difficulties may be an important contributor to insomnia problems for some individuals. Sleep and wak- ing problems may lead to restriction of daytime activities, including social events, exercise, or work. Lack of regular daytime activities and exercise may in turn contribute to insomnia. • Exacerbation of comorbid conditions. Comorbid condi- tions may cause or increase sleep difficulties. Likewise, poor sleep may exacerbate symptomatology of comorbid conditions. Sleep complaints may herald the onset of mood disorders or exacerbation of comorbid conditions. VI. Other History: A complete insomnia history also in- cludes medical, psychiatric, medication/substance, and family/ social/occupational histories. A wide range of medical (Table 5) and psychiatric (Table 6) conditions can be comorbid with

Profit control is an effective measure to manage medicine prices insofar as the regulators have control over the supply of medicines at certain points along the supply chain. Typically, this means that the regulator needs to have full visibility of the supply and distribution chains. The regulator also needs to have the capacity and ability to enforce non-compliance. Profit control is most effective when there is a publicly- funded universal programme for the provision of medicines. In contrast, it may be much less effective in health care settings where the private sector plays a significant role in the delivery of medicines, or where the structure of supply chain is complex or under-developed (183).

1989). In the 1990’s newer agents were developed and marketed that had selective effects on GABA receptors in- cluding Zolpidem (Ambien), Zaleplon (Sonata), Eszopi- clone (Estorra) and Indiplon. While all hypnotics have abuse potential for individuals with addictive histories and personalities, these agents have been noted to have min- imal additive potential (Hajak et al. 2003). These agents are less likely to have deleterious side effects than most OTC treatments for insomnia, however, with increased use, more side effects including next effects on driving have been reported. This effect as well as next day re- bound insomnia has particularly been reported for higher doses of zolpidem (Verster et al. 2002). In many cases, MVA’s occurred in the period of somnolence and cogni- tive impairment during the first few hours after ingestion. Comparatively normal results on psychomotor tests can be obtained 3.25 h. after zaleplon ingestion and 6.25 h. after zopiclone ingestion (Paul et al. 2003). While these agents have excellent efficacy with minimal side effects, at higher doses these agents can exhibit benzodiazepine-like effects. Idiosyncratic reactions of persistent daytime som- nolence and/or memory loss have been reported. Some patients will report next day sedation after the nighttime use of these agents, as well as demonstrate an increased error rate in driving tests (Verster et al. 2007). Such infor- mation was forthcoming only after these drugs became generic and widely utilized in clinical practice. Most sedat- ing drugs if adopted into such widespread use would also be at least as likely to demonstrate epidemiological effects on MVA’s and MVA associated deaths. In the elderly, chronic use of sedating drugs (particularly those with anti-cholinergic side effects) can be associated with an increased risk for falls, and confusion (American Geriatrics Society 2015). Reported next day sleepiness and other side effects associated with hypnotic use are summarized in Table 3. The newer GABA-effective hypnotics are the only medications with demonstrated effectiveness in treating chronic insomnia (NIH State of the Science Conference
Sleep-inducing drugs (hypnotics) are medications specif- ically designed to induce sleepiness directly after intake. Optimal agents affect cognitive performance during this period while inducing minimal sleepiness in the waking day after use. An optimal hypnotic would have low tox- icity and addictive potential, as well a minimal side effect profile (Oswald 1970). Among the first hypnotics, and an agent still in use is chloral hydrate - the original “Mickey Finn” - slipped into the drinks of unsuspecting marks for the purposes of criminal activity. Unfortu- nately, this medication is difficult to use since the LD-50 (potentially fatal dose) is quite close to the therapeutic dose. In the years leading up to the 1970’s, rapidly acting barbiturates were commonly utilized for their hypnotic effects. Unfortunately, these medications, also drugs of abuse, had a significant danger of overdose and contrib- uted to an era that was characterized in part by deaths due to overdoses of sleeping pills. These medications and similar barbiturate-like medications [Methaqualone (Quaalude, Sopor) Glutethimide (Doriden), Ethchlor- vynol (Placidyl), Methyprylon (Nodudar)] have limited availability and are rarely used due to limited efficacy, cognitive effects, the potential for abuse and lethal tox- icity associated with overdose (Oswald 1970). Today their primary therapeutic uses include executions and fa- cilitated euthanasia (Lossignol 2008). Most currently utilized hypnotics affect the widely dis- persed negative neurotransmitter GABA. In the 1970’s benzodiazepines (GABA agonists) were first marketed as hypnotics. Some of these agents had an extremely short duration of action [Triazolam (Halcion)]. While this agent-induced minimal next day somnolence, use was as- sociated with daytime memory impairment, particularly at higher dosages (Roehrs et al. 2000; Adam and Oswald

The inclusion of SPX Weeklys in the VIX Index calculation means that the near-term options will always have more than 23 days to expiration and the next-term options always have less than 37 days to expiration, so the resulting VIX Index value will always reflect an interpolation of σ2 1 and σ2 2 ; i.e., each individual weight is less than or equal to 1 and the sum of the weights equals 1.

With some variation over time and across cancer types, care for the cancer population involves the six categories of services analyzed. The bars in Figures 2a-2c indicate that some patients had significant use of facility services in the year preceding the cancer diagnosis. For both colorectal and lung cancers, total spending on hospital inpatient increased as a percentage of total immediately following diagnosis. In all three cancers, the chemotherapy share of total spending increased rapidly in the first few months after diagnosis and, with the exception of breast cancer, continued at a fairly consistent level of around 20% of spending in subsequent years. Radiation therapy represented a small share of total spending except for breast cancer patients in the year following diagnosis.

(cid:2) The panel recommends that clinicians offer multi- modal analgesia, or the use of a variety of analgesic medications and techniques combined with non- pharmacological interventions, for the treatment of postoperative pain in children and adults (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Multimodal analgesia, defined as the use of a variety of analgesic medication and techniques that target different mechanisms of action in the peripheral and/or central nervous system (which might also be combined with nonpharmacological interventions) might have ad- ditiveorsynergisticeffectsandmoreeffectivepainrelief compared with single-modality interventions. For example, clinicians might offer local anesthetic-based regional (peripheral and neuraxial) analgesic techniques in combination with systemic opioids and other analge- sics as part of a multimodal approach to perioperative pain. Because of the availability of effective nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies for postop- erative pain management, the panel suggests that clini- cians routinely incorporate around the clock nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies into multi- modal analgesia regimens. Systemic opioids might not be required in all patients. One study suggests that it shouldbeavoidedwhennotneeded,becauselimitedev- idence suggests that perioperative opioid therapy might be associated with increased likelihood of long-term opioid use, with its attendant risks.4

Efflorescence is normally a harmless deposit of water- soluble, white salt crystals, as shown in Photo 1. In some instances efflorescence may appear on mortar joints as shown in Photo 2. Efflorescence may appear in limited areas on the surface of brickwork as shown in Photo 3 or, in extreme cases, cover the entire brickwork surface.

As reflected in the statutory new drug and new animal drug approval standards in sections 505 109 and 512 of the FD&amp;C Act and the standard for licensure under section 351 of the PHS Act, the 110 evidence that is the basis for the risk assessment of a drug differs from the evidence that is the 111 basis for an effectiveness determination. The effectiveness determination is generally intended 112 to evaluate a drug’s positive effect based on adequate and well-controlled trials designed to 113 evaluate a specific efficacy variable (or a discrete number of efficacy variables) for the purpose 114 of distinguishing the effect of the drug from other influences.11 In contrast, FDA’s premarket 115 risk assessment is intended to identify and characterize the nature, frequency, and severity of the 116 usually broad spectrum of adverse events and other risks associated with the use of a product 117 based on a range of data sources. For human drugs, the supporting data are generally not derived 118 from studies designed to test a specific safety hypothesis. The assessment is based largely on 119 observations of adverse events from studies intended to assess effectiveness and includes all 120 patients exposed to the investigational drug during its development. For animal drugs, there are 121 generally data from safety studies in the target animal, in addition to observations of adverse 122 events from studies intended to assess effectiveness.12 For both human and animal drugs, 123 relevant data are weighted and integrated, based on the nature and reliability of the data sources, 124 into a coherent assessment of what adverse reactions are reasonably associated with the use of a 125 product and, to the extent possible, their frequency and severity.13 126

receptor antagonist that affects the autonomic nervous system and reduces cardiovascular symptoms (e.g., tachycardia and hypertension) resulting from epinephrine in the circulation. Beta blockers interfere with receptor binding by catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine, of which epinephrine is the principal catecholamine affecting the cardiovascular symptoms. Propranolol is a lipophilic beta blocker that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, it can affect both somatic and CNS target tissues.
• Mood disturbances and cognitive difficulties. Complaints of irritability, loss of interest, mild depression and anxi- ety are common among insomnia patients. Patients with chronic insomnia often complain of mental inefficiency, difficulty remembering, difficulty focusing attention, and difficulty with complex mental tasks. • Quality of life: The irritability and fatigue associated with insomnia may cause interpersonal difficulties for insomnia patients, or avoidance of such activities. Conversely, in- terpersonal difficulties may be an important contributor to insomnia problems for some individuals. Sleep and wak- ing problems may lead to restriction of daytime activities, including social events, exercise, or work. Lack of regular daytime activities and exercise may in turn contribute to insomnia. • Exacerbation of comorbid conditions. Comorbid condi- tions may cause or increase sleep difficulties. Likewise, poor sleep may exacerbate symptomatology of comorbid conditions. Sleep complaints may herald the onset of mood disorders or exacerbation of comorbid conditions. VI. Other History: A complete insomnia history also in- cludes medical, psychiatric, medication/substance, and family/ social/occupational histories.

Although, it was assumed that the 'thicker' articles with wider range of vocabulary is preferable in the editors hands, the editors (and probably the readers) prefer simple, clear and coherent writing, rather than a fancy or complex, pseudo-scientific style. Also Funkhouser and Maccoby (1971) showed that the information gain is especially enhanced by the “use of examples", i.e. it helps a lot to use some non-science material, such as everyday life parallels, historical points, etc. On the other hand, some sections, such as Introduction and Discussion, have to intrigue readers and attract interest and should therefore not be over-simplified. For example, a mysterious title can catch readers' attention and will be easily remembered (e.g.: T.Y. Li and J. Yorke named their famous paper on chaos: "The period three means chaos"). Some sections require more skill and are more important. It is approximated that from all published journal RAs in the world, only less than 5% are read in detail. However, more than 50% of abstracts are read and so the quality of an abstracts is much more important (Gordon, 1983). Therefore, the abstract should present the 'story' of the RA in miniature and should be readable standalone.

In the late 1800s, Andrew Taylor Still identified the neuromusculoskeletal system as the key element in health maintenance and stressed preventive aspects of medi- cine in place of drug therapy. During that time, osteop- athy was truly separate and distinct from the world of allo- pathic medicine. Since then, as medicine in general has become more evidence-based and supported by research, osteopathic philosophy has evolved into a more complete and robust osteopathic medicine. The phrase “osteopathic medicine” is now the accepted term for the profession over “osteopathy,” a now-antiquated term that represents a period when Still championed a near-drugless form of manual medicine. Since its conception, osteopathic med- icine has adapted its body of knowledge to incorporate contemporary scientific thought, including germ theory, pharmacology, and other “allopathic” teachings. The cen- tral tenets of osteopathic thought, however, have been maintained and continue to guide DOs in their practice of medicine. Though interprofessional relations between MDs and DOs are better than they have ever been before, challenges still exist in terms of keeping the osteopathic tradition intact, improving the evidence basis of OMM via clinical research, and advocating for widespread recogni- tion of DOs.

AASM practice parameter papers are based on evidence- based review and grading of literature, often addressing a spe- cific issue or topic. Clinical guidelines provide clinicians with a working overview for disease or disorder evaluation and man- agement. These guidelines include practice parameter papers and also include areas with limited evidence in order to provide a comprehensive practice guideline. Both practice parameters and clinical guidelines define principles of practice that should meet the needs of most patients. They should not, however, be considered exhaustive, inclusive of all available methods of care, or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably expected to obtain the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding appropriateness of any specific therapy must be made by the clinician and patient in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible

We used an expert provided list of 42 relevant domain terms for the Myocardial Perfusion Imaging domain (a sub-domain of nuclear cardiology) to heuristically test the coverage of our ontology terms. Of these, we found 31 exactly matching terms, 2 morphological variants and 8 phrases that contained the terms from the expert list. Out of this 42 domain terms, 1 term, ‘dyperidamole’, was not found in our ontology (dyperidamole is a drug given during pregnancy). We found that this term didn’t exist in the 618 JNC abstracts we were using. Instead, another term, diperidamole (spelling variant) existed in our term list. To do away with noise in our data, we selected terms with greater than average frequency (2.9) of the 10191 retrieved terms and set that as our threshold. We pruned the list to

veys, and frequent teleconference discussions, the expert panel identified consensus areas and recommendations for those areas not covered by AASM practice parameters. Recommendations were generated by panel members and discussed by all. To min- imize individual expert bias, the group anonymously voted and rated consensus recommendations from 1: strongly disagree to 9: strongly agree. Consensus was defined when all experts rated a recommendation 8 or 9. If consensus was not evident after the first vote, the consensus recommendations were discussed again, amended as appropriate, and a second anonymous vote was conducted. If consensus was not evident after the second vote, the process was repeated until consensus was attained to include or exclude a recommendation.

Insomnia occurs in individuals of all ages and races, and has been observed across all cultures and countries.8,9 The actual prevalence of insomnia varies according to the stringency of the definition used. Insomnia symptoms occur in approximately 33% to 50% of the adult population; insomnia symptoms with dis- tress or impairment (i.e., general insomnia disorder) in 10% to 15%; and specific insomnia disorders in 5% to 10%.10 Consis- tent risk factors for insomnia include increasing age, female sex, comorbid (medical, psychiatric, sleep, and substance use) disor- ders, shift work, and possibly unemployment and lower socio- economic status. Patients with comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions are at particularly increased risk, with psychiatric and chronic pain disorders having insomnia rates as high as 50% to 75%.11-13 The risk relationship between insomnia and psychiatric disorders appears to be bidirectional; several studies have also

The increase in full-text downloads for open access articles during their first year after publication suggests that the primary benefit to the nonsubscriber commu- nity is in browsing, as opposed to printing or saving, which would have been indicated by a commensurate increase in PDF downloads. The decrease in abstract views suggests a reader preference for the full docu- ment when available.

industry for anti-infectives overall, and significantly better than for other therapeutic areas, such as neurol- ogy and oncology. One difficulty with such an analysis is that new chemotypes have an inherently higher risk than additional members of established chemical classes, other than the risks of failure due to resistance (which are higher for drugs that have been used for many years). For this review’s new analysis (Table 8), new chemotypes are separated from life-cycle management projects. The overall success rates have not changed significantly in the last 3 years, either for MMV or for the CMR benchmark, which is reassuring. The data shows that a new molecule in formal preclinical evaluation has an 8% chance of becoming part of a product.

In addition to return to learning and sporting environments, older athletes may need to return to driving, where subtle defi- cits could compromise safety. Most sports medicine physicians do not counsel athletes with SRC about driving.90 Driving is a complex process involving coordination of cognitive, visual and motor skills, as well as concentration, attention, visual percep- tion, insight and memory, which can all be affected by SRC.90 Little is known about the risk of driving after SRC, but prelim- inary data suggest some impairment exists when patients with concussion report they are asymptomatic.91 Currently, no widely

The naïve interpretation of this is that no more than 13 candidate compounds would be needed for a reasonable chance of launching one new medicine, and 25 for a com- bination with two NCEs (new chemical entities). How- ever, if one aims for a 90% overall chance of success (P), the number of candidates n, each with a success probabil- ity s (8%) is described by the negative binomial distribu- tion in Eq. 1.

The strength and moisture penetration resistance of a brick masonry cavity wall are affected by the mortar selection and compatibility with the brick units. Portland cement-lime, mortar cement, or masonry cement mortars can be used. However, mortars with an air content less than 12 percent are recommended for their superior bond strength and resistance to moisture penetration. The MSJC Code requires that the allowable flexural tensile stresses be reduced by approximately 50 percent for assemblies constructed with masonry cement mortars or portland cement-lime mortars that have air entrainment. In addition, some building codes prohibit the use of masonry cement mortars and all Type N mortars in Seismic Performance Categories D and E (formerly Seismic Zones 3 and 4). Mortar should meet the proportion requirements of ASTM C 270 Specification for Mortar for Unit Masonry as shown in Table 1. Mortar type selection should be based on project requirements, such as strength and compatibility with a particular brick unit. Types N or S mortars are typically used in brick masonry cavity walls. See Technical Notes 8 Series for more detailed information on mortar types and selection.

of the weakest links in the system. A study in Malawi revealed that the condition of many seriously ill children arriving at clinicshadnotpreviouslybeenrecognized.Insteadofreceiving immediate emergency care they were kept waiting for long periods before being given proper treatment. This resulted in avoidable deaths and disability (28). In Mexico, verbal autopsies of 132 children who died revealed that the majority had been seen by a physician within three days of death. Poor selection of medications and late referral to tertiary care were judged to be important contributory factors in more than half the deaths (29). A qualitative study of 21 hospitals in seven developing countries found that poor triage of incoming patients and inadequate provision of emergency care jeopar- dized the lives of arriving patients (30). Fourteen of the facilities (including 10 of 13 district hospitals) did not have an adequate triage system. A comprehensive review of the management of 131 children treated at these facilities found evidenceofinappropriateordelayedtriagein8%ofcases,poor clinical assessments in 41%, and potentially harmful delays in treatment in 19%. Several international health projects aimed at improving initial triage and treatment have been instituted at district health care facilities. Most focus on the strengthening of maternal and child health. One such project produced guidelines for emergency triage and treatment (28). An evaluation of these guidelines demonstrated that they significantly decreased the time required to assess children in need of urgent medical attention (31). In Sierra Leone a health care facility was upgraded in order to enhance its ability to provide prompt medical and surgicaltreatmenttowomenwithcomplicationsofpregnancy. The annual number of obstetric procedures rose from 2 to 38 over a period of five years. During the same period the

O ceratocone, a degeneração marginal pelúcida e ectasia pós-cirurgia refrativa são doenças que causam afilamento e abaulamento da córnea (estrutura transparente que forma a parede anterior do globo ocular). Estas alterações provocam astigmatismo irregular com distorção visual importante. O grau de embaçamento visual vai depender do grau de astigmatismo produzido e da existência de outras alterações oculares associadas. Astigmatismo pós-transplante de córnea é um grau residual que ocorre dependendo da intera- ção entre córnea doada e receptor (coaptação, cicatrização, abertura e frouxidão de pontos no decorrer da cicatrização e sua retirada).
Return-to-sport progressions should be individualised based on the injury, athlete’s age, history and level of play, and the ability to provide close supervision during the return to activity, and progressions may vary between athletes. Each stage is generally 24 hours without return of concussion symptoms. Consider written clearance from a healthcare professional before return to sport as directed by local laws and regulations.3

Concrete masonry units are usually used for the interior wythe of a cavity wall in combination with a brick masonry exterior. They may also be used as accent bands in the exterior brick wythe. Hollow or solid concrete masonry units should conform to ASTM C 55 Specification for Concrete Building Brick, ASTM C 90 Specification for Loadbearing Concrete Masonry Units or ASTM C 129 Specification for Non-Loadbearing Concrete Masonry Units. Non load- bearing concrete masonry units are usually specified for the interior wythe when the brick and block cavity wall is used as infill walls for concrete or steel frame structural systems if shear loads are not transmitted to that wythe.

• Fatigue and sleepiness. Feelings of fatigue (low energy, physical tiredness, weariness) are more common than symptoms of sleepiness (actual tendency to fall asleep) in patients with chronic insomnia. The presence of significant sleepiness should prompt a search for other potential sleep disorders. The number, duration, and timing of naps should be thoroughly investigated, as both a consequence of in- somnia and a potential contributing factor.

6. Evaluating – can include commenting on the degrees of success and failure of something, or the value of something The ability to analyze and creatively adapt to new situations is at the heart of critical thinking. Paul and Elder (2008, 2014b) asserted that critical thinking provides a vehicle for educating the mind. John Dewey would agree, as from his early work, we have increased our sense of the pragmatic basis of human thought (its instrumental nature), and especially its grounding in actual human purposes, goals, and objectives. Dewey (1910) also discussed critical thinking in terms of reflective thinking, which is an uneasiness in accepting the status quo and that critical thinking is both an emotional and intellectual component. Students must, therefore, be taught to examine, poke, question, and reflect on what they have learned. Scepticism, questioning, and reflection is essential. Dewey also stated that schools should have an intimate relationship with the community it serves. From the review of the research concerning critical thinking and what components are considered important in high school education and later a life-long learning skill, the authors developed a 5-step, critical thinking teaching process as outlined in Table 2. Input from the study’s nine experts who reviewed the model and from suggestions from other model developers, led to the selection of easy to remember letters that describe each step’s process.

When analyzing the data, we found that there does not exist a CUI de(cid:2)nition for a large number of pos- sible concepts. Table 5 shows the number of words in the CUI and ST de(cid:2)nitions for each concept in the NLM-WSD dataset. Only four target words have a CUI de(cid:2)nition for each possible concept. We also found the concept de(cid:2)nitions vary widely in length. The CUI de(cid:2)nitions in the UMLS come from a va- riety of sources and there may exist more than one de(cid:2)nition per source. Unlike CUI de(cid:2)nitions, there does exist an ST de(cid:2)nition for each possible con- cept. The ST de(cid:2)nitions come from the same source and are approximately the same length but they are a broad categorization. We believe this makes them too coarse grained to provide descriptive enough in- formation about their associated concepts.
Properties of insulation materials vary widely. Table 3 shows various properties of insulation materials used in brick masonry cavity walls. The thermal conductivity (k) and thermal resistance (R) provide a means of comparing the insulating properties of insulation materials. These are determined in accordance with ASTM C 177 Test Method for Steady-State Heat Flux Measurements and Thermal Transmission Properties by Means of the Guarded-Hot-Plate Apparatus measured at various temperatures. Due to the large number of types of insulation, and even larger number of manufacturers, Table 3 lists only a few representative values of physical properties. For some materials, an aged or stabilized value is given. In all cases, the aged or stabilized value is the one that should be used in design. Individual manufacturers should be consulted for design values and other properties of their specific materials and their applications.

considerable challenge in assessing, measuring and translating the value of a medicine to a price. In particular, there is no universally accepted view on what dimensions of value should be considered for the purpose of determining medicine prices. Fig. 3.8 (p.34) shows the various dimensions of value noted in the literature and government guidelines, summarized into eight themes. Common dimensions considered in health technology assessments are: clinical and public health needs for the proposed medicine, clinical evidence, economic and financial public health considerations. More debatable is whether to include as innovativeness of the medicine, and the need to incentivize future

The strength and moisture penetration resistance of a brick masonry cavity wall are affected by the mortar selection and compatibility with the brick units. Portland cement-lime, mortar cement, or masonry cement mortars can be used. However, mortars with an air content less than 12 percent are recommended for their superior bond strength and resistance to moisture penetration. The MSJC Code requires that the allowable flexural tensile stresses be reduced by approximately 50 percent for assemblies constructed with masonry cement mortars or portland cement-lime mortars that have air entrainment. In addition, some building codes prohibit the use of masonry cement mortars and all Type N mortars in Seismic Performance Categories D and E (formerly Seismic Zones 3 and 4). Mortar should meet the proportion requirements of ASTM C 270 Specification for Mortar for Unit Masonry as shown in Table 1. Mortar type selection should be based on project requirements, such as strength and compatibility with a particular brick unit. Types N or S mortars are typically used in brick masonry cavity walls. See Technical Notes 8 Series for more detailed information on mortar types and selection.

What is the purpose of a RA and what makes it a good one, and who decides that it is a good RA? Are there rules for easier writing? If the main function of a RA is to transfer a new knowledge on a research topic, then a good paper is the one that is clear, coherent, focused, well argued and uses language that does not have ambiguous or equivoque meaning. However, it is not only the message that is important. The RA must have a well-defined structure and function in serve like a cook-book, so the others can reproduce and repeat explained experiments. Answer research questions Give summary conclusions There are some rules that can make the writing and publishing of RAs 'easier'. Here, we summarised some 'golden' rules that should always be in the mind of an inexperienced researcher (Table 3). We put all these together to make a final list of some 40 logical steps, which can be find in the Appendix.

The numbers in each block are codes for the treatment given to each animal. The purpose of such a design is to reduce heterogeneity associated with time, space and some physical varia- tion. The five animals in Block 1 would be chosen to be as similar as possible with respect to age, weight, genotype and any other variable which might influence the outcome. They would then be assigned at random to one of the five treatments. The animals would be housed in close proximity, and possibly even in the same cage, if the different treatments can be given in such a situation. When measurements are to be made on the animals, those in Block 1 would be treated as a group, with all measurements being made within a short period by the same per- son. Animals in the other blocks would likewise be selected to be as uniform as possible, but might differ in body weight or age, etc. from those in Block 1. They could be measured at a dif- ferent time, if necessary by a different person. Thus, within each block any comparison among treatments would be made on animals which are in all possible ways as similar as possible. The unwanted variation shows up as differences between blocks. This is then removed mathe- matically in the statistical analysis.

Recent analyses of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)- Medicare database tracked healthcare use and costs (projected to 2004 levels) from diagnosis and initial treatment [ 15 ] , in addition to a 4-year follow-up [ 17 ] , for a cohort of 81 659 elderly patients with prostate cancer who had Medicare claims from 1991 to 2003 [ 15 ] , and 1991 to 2004 [ 17 ] , respectively. Treatment in the fi rst year after diagnosis was calculated to incur costs of $21 040 per patient; $13 091 for prostate cancer-related costs and $7949 for medical costs unrelated to prostate cancer [ 15 ] . In terms of cost at each stage, as expected, there was an increase in costs from stage I to IV [ 15,17 ] . Prostate cancer-related costs over 4 years from diagnosis averaged $18 168 per patient [ 17 ] . The annual healthcare cost burden estimated in 2009 is &gt; $2.5 billion annually for initial care alone [ 17 ] .

Objectives of Phase 3. In Phase 3 the working group integrated the findings of the first 2 phases, refined the scoring system, and determined the optimal cut point to define “definite RA.” The goal of this final phase was to utilize the results of Phases 1 and 2 to develop a scoring system that would be applicable to newly presenting patients with undifferentiated inflam- matory arthritis to permit identification of those with a high probability of developing persistent and/or erosive RA. Being intended for use with newly presenting patients, the scoring system should be robust enough that it could be applied repeatedly during the early course of disease, such that a patient identified as not classifiable as having definite RA at initial presentation might be classified as having definite RA at a subsequent time point. The work was not aimed at classifying subjects with established disease, either active or inac- tive. However, the working group recognized that pa- tients may present for the first time with disease that is at a later stage and being treated. Thus, although it was not the explicit charge of the working group to provide
A patient’s decision to use an OON provider selection may be intentional or accidental. Reasons patients may incur OON costs include patient preference for a particular provider or specialty care center that may be out of network, the lack of network providers with appropriate specialists, and the lack of awareness or transparency about which providers are in the patient’s plan network. Common scenarios for accidental use of OON providers are emergency care or care from an OON provider working at an in-network hospital (e.g., radiologist, assistant surgeon, anesthesiologist).22 23 Figure 9 suggests that there might be significant financial consequences to the patient going out of network, which could be exacerbated if health plans remove popular cancer providers from their networks. Figure 9 also provides information on the relationship between the OON percentage (right vertical axis--relative to total spending) and total patient cost-sharing (left vertical axis). While most patients in our study reported under 10% of all OOP cost in the year of diagnosis is spent on out-of- network providers, those in the highest percentile of OOP spending incurred as much as 40% of those costs out-of-network.

The statewide assessments in mathematics, reading, and science are used to measure whether students, and their school and district, are meeting the academic standards. Statewide assessments are one measure of how well students are doing on the content that is part of their daily instruction. It is also a measure of how well schools and districts are doing in aligning their curriculum and teaching the standards.
One can reasonably assert that this beneficial anxiolytic effect might have been enhanced even further under three study design conditions. First, if the inclusion criteria had required each patient to have a high anxiety score prior to the procedure, for instance a minimum of 7 points (with 10 as the maximum), there would have been a greater potential for a difference pre-treatment vs. during the procedure. The six responders had a baseline average of 6.3 points, so there was room for improvement. Of the six responders, two subjects had low baseline anxiety scores (i.e., patient F at 4 points and patient I at 2 points). A higher baseline inclusion parameter could have increased the differential prior to vs. during the EMG procedure. Second, there might not have been a sufficiently long waiting period between the drug administration and the procedure. One can reasonably assert that if the time interval between dosing and the procedure was increased to a minimum of 30 minutes or more (from the 10 – 20 minutes), the percentage of responders and the magnitude of the response could have been greater. However, it should be noted that often in a clinic time-is-of-the-essence between the patient’s initial assessment by the medical provider and the subsequent medical procedure. Some medical providers are willing to pre-treat an anxious patient, typically with an oral benzodiazepine either swallowed intact or pre-dissolved in water, and then have him/her wait (e.g., 30 + min.) for an anxiolytic effect to be acknowledged by the patient. But, some physicians and dentists might be under time constraints or might not be willing to oblige the patient this waiting period. This would not be an obstacle if either the drug has a rapid onset of effect or the patient were to pre-treat themselves immediately prior to arrival at the physician’s office, for instance 30-60 minutes in advance. Even under the conditions of this study that the authors consider might have been sub-optimal, this drug combo delivered by the oral mucosal route provided a rapid onset effect as a PRN medication. This anxiolytic benefit may be useful in treating anticipatory anxiety either in-office or prior to arrival. There is a third limitation to this study to consider. The compounded medicine contained 25 mg of atenolol and 0.2 mg of scopolamine HBr.

In the absence of financial support from governments, the treatment costs presented in Table 4.3 would not be affordable to individual patients. For example, a course of standard (adjuvant) treatment for early stage HER2 positive breast cancer (Adjuvant AC-TH) would cost about 10 years of average annual wages in India and South Africa, and 1.7 years in the USAxx. Patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in India, South Africa and the USA would require, respectively, 3.7 years, 5.6 years and 1.1 years of wages to cover for the costs of a

Phase 1. The aim of Phase 1 was to identify the contributions of clinical and laboratory variables that in practice were the most predictive of the decision to initiate DMARD therapy in a population of patients with early undifferentiated synovitis. Initiation of DMARD therapy was used as an indicator of the physician’s opinion that the patient was at risk of developing persistent and/or erosive arthritis that we would currently consider to be RA. Data on 3,115 patients from 9 early arthritis cohorts who were consid- ered not to have evidence of another possible diagnosis explaining their presentation were obtained. Between July 2007 and November 2008 an expert working group developed an analysis strategy that related an agreed- upon list of standardized clinical and laboratory vari- ables collected at baseline to the initiation of DMARD treatment within the next 12 months. MTX initiation was used as the gold standard for this purpose. The analytical process aimed to identify the independent contribution of each variable on this list and included univariate regression modeling, a subsequent principal components analysis, and a multivariate regression model that included all identified components (25). The resulting list of informative variables identified during that process and the weights based on the odds ratios are shown in Table 1. Phase 2. Phase 2 consisted of a consensus-based, decision science–informed approach, which took place between November 2008 and June 2009. The purpose of this phase was to derive a clinician-based judgment on

Many complicated and expensive techniques have been applied extensively in literature to extract relationships and dependencies from data. These techniques generally rely on a deep parse results that gives a rich representation which is used for applications in knowledge extraction and semantics. The problem with biomedical data parsing is that there is no exhaustive tagged training corpus available to build models for efficient parsing on test data. Also, deep parsing is computationally very expensive compared to shallow parsing that uses the finite state automaton techniques. UMLS graciously provides such a shallow parser[7] that is trained on entire Medline corpus and claims to achieve over 97% accuracy.

The structural design of cavity walls should follow either rational or empirical methods. The rational design method is based on the properties of the wall materials and engineering analysis. This method may be used for any structure where high loads are likely or where tall walls are a necessity. The empirical method is generally satisfactory for one and two-story buildings consisting of light construction with limited floor spans and wall heights; and for multistory buildings where unsupported wall heights are not excessive.

In summary, public and non-profit-making sectors, and by extension tax-payers and philanthropists, have provided considerable financial and non-financial contributions towards the R&amp;D of cancer medicines. This means that in many cases, pharmaceutical companies have not incurred the full costs of R&amp;D. The pharmaceutical industry has also benefited greatly from the knowledge generated by public-sector investments in R&amp;D, and by having access to research supported by public funding at costs, if any, lower than the market value.

Although, it was assumed that the 'thicker' articles with wider range of vocabulary is preferable in the editors hands, the editors (and probably the readers) prefer simple, clear and coherent writing, rather than a fancy or complex, pseudo-scientific style. Also Funkhouser and Maccoby (1971) showed that the information gain is especially enhanced by the “use of examples", i.e. it helps a lot to use some non-science material, such as everyday life parallels, historical points, etc. On the other hand, some sections, such as Introduction and Discussion, have to intrigue readers and attract interest and should therefore not be over-simplified. For example, a mysterious title can catch readers' attention and will be easily remembered (e.g.: T.Y. Li and J. Yorke named their famous paper on chaos: "The period three means chaos"). Some sections require more skill and are more important. It is approximated that from all published journal RAs in the world, only less than 5% are read in detail. However, more than 50% of abstracts are read and so the quality of an abstracts is much more important (Gordon, 1983). Therefore, the abstract should present the 'story' of the RA in miniature and should be readable standalone.

The IOM report supports these findings, stating that diagnostic errors contribute to 10% of patient deaths and 6-17% of hospital adverse events. Other researchers quantify the human cost of diagnostic errors at between 40,000 and 80,000 deaths per year.9 These troubling findings make developing effective methods to prevent diagnostic errors an urgent priority.

ability to sleep and the daytime consequences of poor sleep, dis- torted beliefs and attitudes about the origins and meaning of the insomnia, maladaptive efforts to accommodate to the condition (e.g., schedule or lifestyle changes), and excessive time spent awake in bed. The latter behavior is of particular significance in that it often is associated with “trying hard” to fall asleep and growing frustration and tension in the face of wakefulness. Thus, the bed becomes associated with a state of waking arousal as this conditioning paradigm repeats itself night after night.

The numbers in each block are codes for the treatment given to each animal. The purpose of such a design is to reduce heterogeneity associated with time, space and some physical varia- tion. The five animals in Block 1 would be chosen to be as similar as possible with respect to age, weight, genotype and any other variable which might influence the outcome. They would then be assigned at random to one of the five treatments. The animals would be housed in close proximity, and possibly even in the same cage, if the different treatments can be given in such a situation. When measurements are to be made on the animals, those in Block 1 would be treated as a group, with all measurements being made within a short period by the same per- son. Animals in the other blocks would likewise be selected to be as uniform as possible, but might differ in body weight or age, etc. from those in Block 1. They could be measured at a dif- ferent time, if necessary by a different person. Thus, within each block any comparison among treatments would be made on animals which are in all possible ways as similar as possible. The unwanted variation shows up as differences between blocks. This is then removed mathe- matically in the statistical analysis.
Proper Sizing-Firebox dimensions should be selected so that the fire fills the combustion chamber during operation. This provides greater heating efficiency. Careful consideration should be given to size of the fireplace opening best suited for the room in which it is to be located. Location and size are important not only from the standpoint of appearance, but also of operation. If the fireplace opening is too small, it may function properly but will not produce enough heat to warm the room. If the opening is too large, a fire that would fill the combustion chamber may overwhelm the room. In such a case, the firebox opening would require a larger flue area and consume larger amounts of interior air even if exterior combustion air is provided. Table 2 provides suggested widths of conventional fireplace openings appropriate for various room sizes. For example, a room with 300 ft2 (28 m2) of floor area is best served by a fireplace with an opening 30 in. (750 mm) to 36 in. (900 mm) wide.
Efflorescence is normally a harmless deposit of water- soluble, white salt crystals, as shown in Photo 1. In some instances efflorescence may appear on mortar joints as shown in Photo 2. Efflorescence may appear in limited areas on the surface of brickwork as shown in Photo 3 or, in extreme cases, cover the entire brickwork surface.

Brick has been used to create beautiful buildings for centuries. Most of these structures have a substantial history of outstanding performance. In some instances the appearance is affected by the development of efflorescence or stains. These may originate from materials in the brick or mortar, from adjacent materials, and from outside sourc- es such as cleaning agents. Each has a particular chemical composition and a unique means of removal.

medically related text and metadata features, such as “pa- tients,” “alzheimer,” “health information management,” and “medicine” are also important and of mostly positive polar- ity, since medical articles attract greater news coverage than, say, a recently published computer science paper. As we dis- cuss later, the presence of “alzheimer” as an important, neg- ative feature is more an artifact of the dataset than an iden- tification of trends in popularity. We also find an artifact of year (2016) of the dataset with the feature “zika virus,” due to the 2015-2016 zika epidemic in North and South Amer- ica.

• Mood disturbances and cognitive difficulties. Complaints of irritability, loss of interest, mild depression and anxi- ety are common among insomnia patients. Patients with chronic insomnia often complain of mental inefficiency, difficulty remembering, difficulty focusing attention, and difficulty with complex mental tasks. • Quality of life: The irritability and fatigue associated with insomnia may cause interpersonal difficulties for insomnia patients, or avoidance of such activities. Conversely, in- terpersonal difficulties may be an important contributor to insomnia problems for some individuals. Sleep and wak- ing problems may lead to restriction of daytime activities, including social events, exercise, or work. Lack of regular daytime activities and exercise may in turn contribute to insomnia. • Exacerbation of comorbid conditions. Comorbid condi- tions may cause or increase sleep difficulties. Likewise, poor sleep may exacerbate symptomatology of comorbid conditions. Sleep complaints may herald the onset of mood disorders or exacerbation of comorbid conditions. VI. Other History: A complete insomnia history also in- cludes medical, psychiatric, medication/substance, and family/ social/occupational histories. A wide range of medical (Table 5) and psychiatric (Table 6) conditions can be comorbid with

AASM practice parameter papers are based on evidence- based review and grading of literature, often addressing a spe- cific issue or topic. Clinical guidelines provide clinicians with a working overview for disease or disorder evaluation and man- agement. These guidelines include practice parameter papers and also include areas with limited evidence in order to provide a comprehensive practice guideline. Both practice parameters and clinical guidelines define principles of practice that should meet the needs of most patients. They should not, however, be considered exhaustive, inclusive of all available methods of care, or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably expected to obtain the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding appropriateness of any specific therapy must be made by the clinician and patient in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible

Proper Sizing-Firebox dimensions should be selected so that the fire fills the combustion chamber during operation. This provides greater heating efficiency. Careful consideration should be given to size of the fireplace opening best suited for the room in which it is to be located. Location and size are important not only from the standpoint of appearance, but also of operation. If the fireplace opening is too small, it may function properly but will not produce enough heat to warm the room. If the opening is too large, a fire that would fill the combustion chamber may overwhelm the room. In such a case, the firebox opening would require a larger flue area and consume larger amounts of interior air even if exterior combustion air is provided. Table 2 provides suggested widths of conventional fireplace openings appropriate for various room sizes. For example, a room with 300 ft2 (28 m2) of floor area is best served by a fireplace with an opening 30 in. (750 mm) to 36 in. (900 mm) wide.

Wind turbines will be used to harness the kinetic energy of the moving air over the oceans on the OCS and convert it to electricity. Offshore winds are less turbulent (because the ocean is flat relative to onshore topography), and they tend to flow at higher speeds than onshore winds, thus allowing turbines to produce more electricity. Because the potential energy produced from the wind is directly proportional to the cube of the wind speed, increased wind speeds of only a few miles per hour can produce a significantly larger amount of electricity. For instance, a turbine at a site with an average wind speed of 16 mph would produce 50% more electricity than at a site with the same turbine and average wind speeds of 14 mph (Offshore Wind 2006).

of the weakest links in the system. A study in Malawi revealed that the condition of many seriously ill children arriving at clinicshadnotpreviouslybeenrecognized.Insteadofreceiving immediate emergency care they were kept waiting for long periods before being given proper treatment. This resulted in avoidable deaths and disability (28). In Mexico, verbal autopsies of 132 children who died revealed that the majority had been seen by a physician within three days of death. Poor selection of medications and late referral to tertiary care were judged to be important contributory factors in more than half the deaths (29). A qualitative study of 21 hospitals in seven developing countries found that poor triage of incoming patients and inadequate provision of emergency care jeopar- dized the lives of arriving patients (30). Fourteen of the facilities (including 10 of 13 district hospitals) did not have an adequate triage system. A comprehensive review of the management of 131 children treated at these facilities found evidenceofinappropriateordelayedtriagein8%ofcases,poor clinical assessments in 41%, and potentially harmful delays in treatment in 19%. Several international health projects aimed at improving initial triage and treatment have been instituted at district health care facilities. Most focus on the strengthening of maternal and child health. One such project produced guidelines for emergency triage and treatment (28). An evaluation of these guidelines demonstrated that they significantly decreased the time required to assess children in need of urgent medical attention (31). In Sierra Leone a health care facility was upgraded in order to enhance its ability to provide prompt medical and surgicaltreatmenttowomenwithcomplicationsofpregnancy. The annual number of obstetric procedures rose from 2 to 38 over a period of five years. During the same period the

In the future, we would also like to increase the size of our con(cid:3)ated dataset and possibly create a biomedical all-words disambiguation test set to test our approach. Unlike SenseClusters, our approach can be used to perform all-words disambiguation. For example, given the sentence: His weight has fluctuated during the past month. We (cid:2)rst create a instance vector containing fluctuated, past and months for the word weight and a concept vector for each of its possible concepts, (cid:147)C0005912: Body Weight(cid:148) and (cid:147)C0699807: Quantitative Concept(cid:148) us- ing their context descriptions. We then calculate the cosine between the instance vector and each of the two concept vectors. The concept whose vector has the smallest cosine score is assigned to weight. We then repeat this process for fluctuated, past and months. We also plan to explore using different contex- tual information to improve the accuracy of our approach. We are currently exploring using co- occurrence and relational information about the pos- sible CUIs in the UMLS. Our IDF stoplist exper-

Rectal cancer patients require a colostomy more often than colon cancer patients (29% versus 12%, respectively).82 A permanent colos- tomy may be required if the anus and the sphincter muscle are removed during surgery.
Objectives of Phase 3. In Phase 3 the working group integrated the findings of the first 2 phases, refined the scoring system, and determined the optimal cut point to define “definite RA.” The goal of this final phase was to utilize the results of Phases 1 and 2 to develop a scoring system that would be applicable to newly presenting patients with undifferentiated inflam- matory arthritis to permit identification of those with a high probability of developing persistent and/or erosive RA. Being intended for use with newly presenting patients, the scoring system should be robust enough that it could be applied repeatedly during the early course of disease, such that a patient identified as not classifiable as having definite RA at initial presentation might be classified as having definite RA at a subsequent time point. The work was not aimed at classifying subjects with established disease, either active or inac- tive. However, the working group recognized that pa- tients may present for the first time with disease that is at a later stage and being treated. Thus, although it was not the explicit charge of the working group to provide

samples)) / (geometric mean cpm of no drug samples). Percentage reductions are used to plot percentage inhibition of growth as a function of drug concentrations. IC 50 values are determined by linear regression analyses on the linear segments of the curves (IC 90 values can also be determined by curve-fitting and can provide an useful measure of variation between experiments). Assays are typically repeated on two or three separate occasions. Within each experiment, standard deviations are typically less than 10% of the mean. Differences in parasite stages of development can lead to up to two-fold shifts in the IC 50 values between experiments; however, these differences rarely affect the overall relationships between the parasite lines in terms of their differences in drug response 4-11 .

The structural design of cavity walls should follow either rational or empirical methods. The rational design method is based on the properties of the wall materials and engineering analysis. This method may be used for any structure where high loads are likely or where tall walls are a necessity. The empirical method is generally satisfactory for one and two-story buildings consisting of light construction with limited floor spans and wall heights; and for multistory buildings where unsupported wall heights are not excessive.

Wind turbines will be used to harness the kinetic energy of the moving air over the oceans on the OCS and convert it to electricity. Offshore winds are less turbulent (because the ocean is flat relative to onshore topography), and they tend to flow at higher speeds than onshore winds, thus allowing turbines to produce more electricity. Because the potential energy produced from the wind is directly proportional to the cube of the wind speed, increased wind speeds of only a few miles per hour can produce a significantly larger amount of electricity. For instance, a turbine at a site with an average wind speed of 16 mph would produce 50% more electricity than at a site with the same turbine and average wind speeds of 14 mph (Offshore Wind 2006).

OOP costs in the year of diagnosis came mostly from professional and non-inpatient facility services. Figure 8 shows the level of OOP costs by percentile for all study cancers combined. In general, patient cost-sharing is higher for out-of-network services than in-network. Not surprisingly, cancer patients in the highest decile of OOP spending also incurred the highest portion of OOP costs for out- of-network providers; conversely, patients in the lowest decile incurred the lowest portion of OOP costs for out-of-network providers.

In the future, we would also like to increase the size of our con(cid:3)ated dataset and possibly create a biomedical all-words disambiguation test set to test our approach. Unlike SenseClusters, our approach can be used to perform all-words disambiguation. For example, given the sentence: His weight has fluctuated during the past month. We (cid:2)rst create a instance vector containing fluctuated, past and months for the word weight and a concept vector for each of its possible concepts, (cid:147)C0005912: Body Weight(cid:148) and (cid:147)C0699807: Quantitative Concept(cid:148) us- ing their context descriptions. We then calculate the cosine between the instance vector and each of the two concept vectors. The concept whose vector has the smallest cosine score is assigned to weight. We then repeat this process for fluctuated, past and months. We also plan to explore using different contex- tual information to improve the accuracy of our approach. We are currently exploring using co- occurrence and relational information about the pos- sible CUIs in the UMLS. Our IDF stoplist exper-

Of note, mice under single or combined metformin treatments showed an extended survival, whereas 84% of the nontreat- ed mice succumbed within 1 week after infection (Table 1). In conclusion, metformin treatment in combi- nation with suboptimal dosage of conventional antimalarials is more efficacious in reducing parasite load.

• Mood disturbances and cognitive difficulties. Complaints of irritability, loss of interest, mild depression and anxi- ety are common among insomnia patients. Patients with chronic insomnia often complain of mental inefficiency, difficulty remembering, difficulty focusing attention, and difficulty with complex mental tasks. • Quality of life: The irritability and fatigue associated with insomnia may cause interpersonal difficulties for insomnia patients, or avoidance of such activities. Conversely, in- terpersonal difficulties may be an important contributor to insomnia problems for some individuals. Sleep and wak- ing problems may lead to restriction of daytime activities, including social events, exercise, or work. Lack of regular daytime activities and exercise may in turn contribute to insomnia. • Exacerbation of comorbid conditions. Comorbid condi- tions may cause or increase sleep difficulties. Likewise, poor sleep may exacerbate symptomatology of comorbid conditions. Sleep complaints may herald the onset of mood disorders or exacerbation of comorbid conditions. VI. Other History: A complete insomnia history also in- cludes medical, psychiatric, medication/substance, and family/ social/occupational histories. A wide range of medical (Table 5) and psychiatric (Table 6) conditions can be comorbid with

Your child has been identified as needing services for English Language Learners (ELL). Your child will be placed in the ESL/Bilingual Education dual language immersion program, as outlined in the attached document. We believe that this program will help meet your child’s educational needs and enhance his/her academic success in school. Your child will be assessed twice yearly, or as needed, to determine progress toward individual ELL goals. When your child scores in the acceptable range (4.5 Literacy/5.0 Overall) on all areas of the W-APT or ACCESS assessment they will be exited from the program. If your student currently has an Individualized Education Program (IEP), their needs will continue to be met through their current accommodations.
In the absence of financial support from governments, the treatment costs presented in Table 4.3 would not be affordable to individual patients. For example, a course of standard (adjuvant) treatment for early stage HER2 positive breast cancer (Adjuvant AC-TH) would cost about 10 years of average annual wages in India and South Africa, and 1.7 years in the USAxx. Patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in India, South Africa and the USA would require, respectively, 3.7 years, 5.6 years and 1.1 years of wages to cover for the costs of a

The FDA recently recommended that a warning be issued regarding adverse effects associated with BzRA hypnotics. These medications have been associated with reports of disruptive sleep related behaviors including sleepwalking, eating, driving, and sexual behavior.

The inclusion of SPX Weeklys in the VIX Index calculation means that the near-term options will always have more than 23 days to expiration and the next-term options always have less than 37 days to expiration, so the resulting VIX Index value will always reflect an interpolation of σ2 1 and σ2 2 ; i.e., each individual weight is less than or equal to 1 and the sum of the weights equals 1.

(cid:2) The panel recommends that clinicians offer multi- modal analgesia, or the use of a variety of analgesic medications and techniques combined with non- pharmacological interventions, for the treatment of postoperative pain in children and adults (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Multimodal analgesia, defined as the use of a variety of analgesic medication and techniques that target different mechanisms of action in the peripheral and/or central nervous system (which might also be combined with nonpharmacological interventions) might have ad- ditiveorsynergisticeffectsandmoreeffectivepainrelief compared with single-modality interventions. For example, clinicians might offer local anesthetic-based regional (peripheral and neuraxial) analgesic techniques in combination with systemic opioids and other analge- sics as part of a multimodal approach to perioperative pain. Because of the availability of effective nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies for postop- erative pain management, the panel suggests that clini- cians routinely incorporate around the clock nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies into multi- modal analgesia regimens. Systemic opioids might not be required in all patients. One study suggests that it shouldbeavoidedwhennotneeded,becauselimitedev- idence suggests that perioperative opioid therapy might be associated with increased likelihood of long-term opioid use, with its attendant risks.4
Objectives of Phase 3. In Phase 3 the working group integrated the findings of the first 2 phases, refined the scoring system, and determined the optimal cut point to define “definite RA.” The goal of this final phase was to utilize the results of Phases 1 and 2 to develop a scoring system that would be applicable to newly presenting patients with undifferentiated inflam- matory arthritis to permit identification of those with a high probability of developing persistent and/or erosive RA. Being intended for use with newly presenting patients, the scoring system should be robust enough that it could be applied repeatedly during the early course of disease, such that a patient identified as not classifiable as having definite RA at initial presentation might be classified as having definite RA at a subsequent time point. The work was not aimed at classifying subjects with established disease, either active or inac- tive. However, the working group recognized that pa- tients may present for the first time with disease that is at a later stage and being treated. Thus, although it was not the explicit charge of the working group to provide

President Obama has recently expressed a strong conviction that “Science offers great potential for improving health”. The President has announced a research initiative that aims to accelerate progress toward a new era of precision medicine. The time is accurate for this idealistic initiative, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other partners will work to attain this vision [7]. The concept of precision medicine speaks of prevention and treatment strategies that take individual variability into account. Even though it is not new, the impact of practicality is still deprived. If one considers blood typing, for instance, has been used to guide blood transfusions for more than a century. But the vision of applying this concept broadly has been intensely improved by the latest development of large-scale biologic databases (such as the human genome sequence), powerful methods for typifying patients (such as proteomics, metabolomics, genomics, diverse cellular assays, and even mobile health technology), and computational tools for analyzing large sets of data. Francis S.Collins et al. stated that, “What is necessary now is a broad
Concrete masonry units are usually used for the interior wythe of a cavity wall in combination with a brick masonry exterior. They may also be used as accent bands in the exterior brick wythe. Hollow or solid concrete masonry units should conform to ASTM C 55 Specification for Concrete Building Brick, ASTM C 90 Specification for Loadbearing Concrete Masonry Units or ASTM C 129 Specification for Non-Loadbearing Concrete Masonry Units. Non load- bearing concrete masonry units are usually specified for the interior wythe when the brick and block cavity wall is used as infill walls for concrete or steel frame structural systems if shear loads are not transmitted to that wythe.

ability to sleep and the daytime consequences of poor sleep, dis- torted beliefs and attitudes about the origins and meaning of the insomnia, maladaptive efforts to accommodate to the condition (e.g., schedule or lifestyle changes), and excessive time spent awake in bed. The latter behavior is of particular significance in that it often is associated with “trying hard” to fall asleep and growing frustration and tension in the face of wakefulness. Thus, the bed becomes associated with a state of waking arousal as this conditioning paradigm repeats itself night after night.
Based on the size of the flue selected, a preliminary damper size must be assumed. At this point in the design process, it is only necessary to decide if the damper throat area to be used will be equal to or twice the flue area. Once this decision has been made the Inlet Loss Coefficient, K 2, may be determined. If the damper throat area is equal to the flue area, K 2 is equal to 2.5. If the damper throat is twice the flue area, K 2 is equal to 1.0.

receptor antagonist that affects the autonomic nervous system and reduces cardiovascular symptoms (e.g., tachycardia and hypertension) resulting from epinephrine in the circulation. Beta blockers interfere with receptor binding by catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine, of which epinephrine is the principal catecholamine affecting the cardiovascular symptoms. Propranolol is a lipophilic beta blocker that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, it can affect both somatic and CNS target tissues.

of care data [ 12 ] . The NCI estimate for expenditure on prostate cancer treatment in 2006 was $9.862 billion, and average Medicare payments per patient in the fi rst year after diagnosis were $11 000. It should be noted when interpreting this data that use of PSA testing for prostate cancer is more widespread in the USA than in many other countries, thus increasing the number of cases identifi ed. In addition, Medicare did not cover certain cancer care expenses such as oral medicines, commonly used to treat prostate cancer until January 2006. These out-of-pocket costs may comprise 10% of the $11 000 estimate. Direct medical expenditures are only one part of the total economic burden of cancer, as cancer- related illnesses and death lead to losses in economic productivity.

Feelings of fatigue (low energy, physical tiredness, weariness) are more common than symptoms of sleepiness (actual tendency to fall asleep) in patients with chronic insomnia. The presence of significant sleepiness should prompt a search for other potential sleep disorders. The number, duration, and timing of naps should be thoroughly investigated, as both a consequence of in- somnia and a potential contributing factor.

The inclusion of SPX Weeklys in the VIX Index calculation means that the near-term options will always have more than 23 days to expiration and the next-term options always have less than 37 days to expiration, so the resulting VIX Index value will always reflect an interpolation of σ2 1 and σ2 2 ; i.e., each individual weight is less than or equal to 1 and the sum of the weights equals 1.

considerable challenge in assessing, measuring and translating the value of a medicine to a price. In particular, there is no universally accepted view on what dimensions of value should be considered for the purpose of determining medicine prices. Fig. 3.8 (p.34) shows the various dimensions of value noted in the literature and government guidelines, summarized into eight themes. Common dimensions considered in health technology assessments are: clinical and public health needs for the proposed medicine, clinical evidence, economic and financial public health considerations. More debatable is whether to include as innovativeness of the medicine, and the need to incentivize future

On the con(cid:3)ated dataset, the pseudowords a a, a o, d d and e e have a corresponding CUI de(cid:2)ni- tion for each of their possible concepts therefore the accuracy for CUI and CUI→ would be the same for these datasets and is not reported. The pseudowords a a i, x p p and d a m e do not have a CUI de(cid:2)ni- tions for each of their possible concepts. The results show that CUI obtained the highest accuracy for six out of the seven datasets and CUI→ST obtained the highest accuracy for one. These experiments were run using the unigram feature.

The strength and moisture penetration resistance of a brick masonry cavity wall are affected by the mortar selection and compatibility with the brick units. Portland cement-lime, mortar cement, or masonry cement mortars can be used. However, mortars with an air content less than 12 percent are recommended for their superior bond strength and resistance to moisture penetration. The MSJC Code requires that the allowable flexural tensile stresses be reduced by approximately 50 percent for assemblies constructed with masonry cement mortars or portland cement-lime mortars that have air entrainment. In addition, some building codes prohibit the use of masonry cement mortars and all Type N mortars in Seismic Performance Categories D and E (formerly Seismic Zones 3 and 4). Mortar should meet the proportion requirements of ASTM C 270 Specification for Mortar for Unit Masonry as shown in Table 1. Mortar type selection should be based on project requirements, such as strength and compatibility with a particular brick unit. Types N or S mortars are typically used in brick masonry cavity walls. See Technical Notes 8 Series for more detailed information on mortar types and selection.

We used an expert provided list of 42 relevant domain terms for the Myocardial Perfusion Imaging domain (a sub-domain of nuclear cardiology) to heuristically test the coverage of our ontology terms. Of these, we found 31 exactly matching terms, 2 morphological variants and 8 phrases that contained the terms from the expert list. Out of this 42 domain terms, 1 term, ‘dyperidamole’, was not found in our ontology (dyperidamole is a drug given during pregnancy). We found that this term didn’t exist in the 618 JNC abstracts we were using. Instead, another term, diperidamole (spelling variant) existed in our term list. To do away with noise in our data, we selected terms with greater than average frequency (2.9) of the 10191 retrieved terms and set that as our threshold. We pruned the list to

Although, it was assumed that the 'thicker' articles with wider range of vocabulary is preferable in the editors hands, the editors (and probably the readers) prefer simple, clear and coherent writing, rather than a fancy or complex, pseudo-scientific style. Also Funkhouser and Maccoby (1971) showed that the information gain is especially enhanced by the “use of examples", i.e. it helps a lot to use some non-science material, such as everyday life parallels, historical points, etc. On the other hand, some sections, such as Introduction and Discussion, have to intrigue readers and attract interest and should therefore not be over-simplified. For example, a mysterious title can catch readers' attention and will be easily remembered (e.g.: T.Y. Li and J. Yorke named their famous paper on chaos: "The period three means chaos"). Some sections require more skill and are more important. It is approximated that from all published journal RAs in the world, only less than 5% are read in detail. However, more than 50% of abstracts are read and so the quality of an abstracts is much more important (Gordon, 1983). Therefore, the abstract should present the 'story' of the RA in miniature and should be readable standalone.

Recent analyses of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)- Medicare database tracked healthcare use and costs (projected to 2004 levels) from diagnosis and initial treatment [ 15 ] , in addition to a 4-year follow-up [ 17 ] , for a cohort of 81 659 elderly patients with prostate cancer who had Medicare claims from 1991 to 2003 [ 15 ] , and 1991 to 2004 [ 17 ] , respectively. Treatment in the fi rst year after diagnosis was calculated to incur costs of $21 040 per patient; $13 091 for prostate cancer-related costs and $7949 for medical costs unrelated to prostate cancer [ 15 ] . In terms of cost at each stage, as expected, there was an increase in costs from stage I to IV [ 15,17 ] . Prostate cancer-related costs over 4 years from diagnosis averaged $18 168 per patient [ 17 ] . The annual healthcare cost burden estimated in 2009 is &gt; $2.5 billion annually for initial care alone [ 17 ] .

The TSST method has been used to study the effects of oral propranolol in volunteer subjects [25-28]. The assessments of psychic anxiety can be assessed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) or other similar tools [29,30]. The somatic and psychic effects of oral propranolol were tested using the TSST method in healthy adult volunteers. Propranolol (40 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, reduced systolic blood pressure, and enhanced cognitive flexibility during stress. In another study propranolol (80 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, but paradoxically increased salivary cortisol, and did not significantly affect BP or subjective stress [25]. But, in another TSST study daily oral propranolol (80 mg) did not affect the salivary cortisol response [27].

Composite or combination flashings are typically less expensive than sheet metal and are easier to install. The most predominant type is a thin layer of metal sandwiched between one or two layers of another material. The metal layer is usually of aluminum, copper or lead. It is covered on one or both sides with various materials, such as asphalt coatings, kraft paper, fiberglass fabric or plastic films. Product literature should be reviewed to determine whether these materials are appropriate for use in brick masonry cavity walls. Consideration should be given to compatibility with adjacent sealants, delamination due to moisture penetration and movement of the wall system.

Many complicated and expensive techniques have been applied extensively in literature to extract relationships and dependencies from data. These techniques generally rely on a deep parse results that gives a rich representation which is used for applications in knowledge extraction and semantics. The problem with biomedical data parsing is that there is no exhaustive tagged training corpus available to build models for efficient parsing on test data. Also, deep parsing is computationally very expensive compared to shallow parsing that uses the finite state automaton techniques. UMLS graciously provides such a shallow parser[7] that is trained on entire Medline corpus and claims to achieve over 97% accuracy.

Phase 1. The aim of Phase 1 was to identify the contributions of clinical and laboratory variables that in practice were the most predictive of the decision to initiate DMARD therapy in a population of patients with early undifferentiated synovitis. Initiation of DMARD therapy was used as an indicator of the physician’s opinion that the patient was at risk of developing persistent and/or erosive arthritis that we would currently consider to be RA. Data on 3,115 patients from 9 early arthritis cohorts who were consid- ered not to have evidence of another possible diagnosis explaining their presentation were obtained. Between July 2007 and November 2008 an expert working group developed an analysis strategy that related an agreed- upon list of standardized clinical and laboratory vari- ables collected at baseline to the initiation of DMARD treatment within the next 12 months. MTX initiation was used as the gold standard for this purpose. The analytical process aimed to identify the independent contribution of each variable on this list and included univariate regression modeling, a subsequent principal components analysis, and a multivariate regression model that included all identified components (25). The resulting list of informative variables identified during that process and the weights based on the odds ratios are shown in Table 1. Phase 2. Phase 2 consisted of a consensus-based, decision science–informed approach, which took place between November 2008 and June 2009. The purpose of this phase was to derive a clinician-based judgment on

• Fatigue and sleepiness. Feelings of fatigue (low energy, physical tiredness, weariness) are more common than symptoms of sleepiness (actual tendency to fall asleep) in patients with chronic insomnia. The presence of significant sleepiness should prompt a search for other potential sleep disorders. The number, duration, and timing of naps should be thoroughly investigated, as both a consequence of in- somnia and a potential contributing factor.

The analysis found that low-income countries could spend on average up to US$ 3800 per cancer patient annually on cancer medicines for all newly-diagnosed cancer patients, and the total expenditure on these medicines would be within the generously assumed 5% of the total health expenditure (Table 4.2). In high- income countries, the analysis found that a budget threshold of 5% of the total health expenditure would allow a spending of up to US$ 40 600 on cancer medicines per patient per year, with a view to providing universal coverage.

What is the purpose of a RA and what makes it a good one, and who decides that it is a good RA? Are there rules for easier writing? If the main function of a RA is to transfer a new knowledge on a research topic, then a good paper is the one that is clear, coherent, focused, well argued and uses language that does not have ambiguous or equivoque meaning. However, it is not only the message that is important. The RA must have a well-defined structure and function in serve like a cook-book, so the others can reproduce and repeat explained experiments. Answer research questions Give summary conclusions There are some rules that can make the writing and publishing of RAs 'easier'. Here, we summarised some 'golden' rules that should always be in the mind of an inexperienced researcher (Table 3). We put all these together to make a final list of some 40 logical steps, which can be find in the Appendix.

Of note, mice under single or combined metformin treatments showed an extended survival, whereas 84% of the nontreat- ed mice succumbed within 1 week after infection (Table 1). In conclusion, metformin treatment in combi- nation with suboptimal dosage of conventional antimalarials is more efficacious in reducing parasite load.

Insomnia occurs in individuals of all ages and races, and has been observed across all cultures and countries.8,9 The actual prevalence of insomnia varies according to the stringency of the definition used. Insomnia symptoms occur in approximately 33% to 50% of the adult population; insomnia symptoms with dis- tress or impairment (i.e., general insomnia disorder) in 10% to 15%; and specific insomnia disorders in 5% to 10%.10 Consis- tent risk factors for insomnia include increasing age, female sex, comorbid (medical, psychiatric, sleep, and substance use) disor- ders, shift work, and possibly unemployment and lower socio- economic status. Patients with comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions are at particularly increased risk, with psychiatric and chronic pain disorders having insomnia rates as high as 50% to 75%.11-13 The risk relationship between insomnia and psychiatric disorders appears to be bidirectional; several studies have also

The increase in full-text downloads for open access articles during their first year after publication suggests that the primary benefit to the nonsubscriber commu- nity is in browsing, as opposed to printing or saving, which would have been indicated by a commensurate increase in PDF downloads. The decrease in abstract views suggests a reader preference for the full docu- ment when available.

While many of these symptoms can be seen with other conditions such as allergies, we ask that you seek medical evaluation if you identify any of these symptoms. Loss of taste or smell is very specific to COVID‐19 and may be described as food tasting bland, rather than not being able to taste.

1. Decide when to clean. Mortar must harden prior to cleaning. It is generally best to schedule cleaning at least seven days after brickwork is completed. In some cases it may be possible to clean earlier; how- ever, effects on the masonry and influencing factors such as weather conditions and the type of brick and mortar should be carefully considered. Prolonged time periods between the completion of the masonry and cleaning should be avoided. After one month, mortar smears and splatters left on brickwork become increasingly difficult to remove. 2. Remove larger clumps of mortar using wooden paddles or nonmetallic tools. Metal tools may damage the brickwork or leave behind fragments that oxidize and cause rust stains. 3. Select the proper cleaning solution. There are many types of proprietary cleaners available that are for- mulated to remove specific stains or for use with a particular type of brick. Be careful to select cleaning products suitable for the brick, mortar and adjacent materials and follow the cleaner manufacturer’s rec- ommended instructions. Each product being considered should be evaluated as discussed previously in Trial Cleaning.

6. Evaluating – can include commenting on the degrees of success and failure of something, or the value of something The ability to analyze and creatively adapt to new situations is at the heart of critical thinking. Paul and Elder (2008, 2014b) asserted that critical thinking provides a vehicle for educating the mind. John Dewey would agree, as from his early work, we have increased our sense of the pragmatic basis of human thought (its instrumental nature), and especially its grounding in actual human purposes, goals, and objectives. Dewey (1910) also discussed critical thinking in terms of reflective thinking, which is an uneasiness in accepting the status quo and that critical thinking is both an emotional and intellectual component. Students must, therefore, be taught to examine, poke, question, and reflect on what they have learned. Scepticism, questioning, and reflection is essential. Dewey also stated that schools should have an intimate relationship with the community it serves. From the review of the research concerning critical thinking and what components are considered important in high school education and later a life-long learning skill, the authors developed a 5-step, critical thinking teaching process as outlined in Table 2. Input from the study’s nine experts who reviewed the model and from suggestions from other model developers, led to the selection of easy to remember letters that describe each step’s process.
The industry also often justifies prices of medicine by stating that return on investment needs to be sufficient to incentivize the discovery of future medicines (109). To this point, the industry noted that 20% of its revenues were re-invested into R&amp;D (87).

For newer targeted cancer medicines, there are two additional areas of uncertainty. Firstly, despite their established mechanisms of action, targeted cancer medicines may not have clinically-meaningful activities against all tumours with a matching genetic mutation. To this point, a clinical trial has found that the progression-free survival of patients with metastatic solid tumour refractory to standard of care did not improve with the use of targeted therapies that matched with the tumour’s molecular profile but outside their approved indications, compared to patients who received treatment at the choice of their treating physicians (79). This means that targeted therapies should only be used according to approved indications and not based on identified molecular alternations or the general type of cancer.

Insomnia occurs in individuals of all ages and races, and has been observed across all cultures and countries.8,9 The actual prevalence of insomnia varies according to the stringency of the definition used. Insomnia symptoms occur in approximately 33% to 50% of the adult population; insomnia symptoms with dis- tress or impairment (i.e., general insomnia disorder) in 10% to 15%; and specific insomnia disorders in 5% to 10%.10 Consis- tent risk factors for insomnia include increasing age, female sex, comorbid (medical, psychiatric, sleep, and substance use) disor- ders, shift work, and possibly unemployment and lower socio- economic status. Patients with comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions are at particularly increased risk, with psychiatric and chronic pain disorders having insomnia rates as high as 50% to 75%.11-13 The risk relationship between insomnia and psychiatric disorders appears to be bidirectional; several studies have also

Osteopathic medical schools also use differing cri- teria when selecting candidates to interview and/or extending offers of admission. For example, in the eval- uation of applicants, osteopathic medical schools place more emphasis on candidates’ interest in and knowledge of osteopathic philosophy. They also are more likely to seek out students who are interested in pursuing careers in primary care and in rural or underserved areas.3 Osteo- pathic admissions programs often view the candidate as a

President Obama has recently expressed a strong conviction that “Science offers great potential for improving health”. The President has announced a research initiative that aims to accelerate progress toward a new era of precision medicine. The time is accurate for this idealistic initiative, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other partners will work to attain this vision [7]. The concept of precision medicine speaks of prevention and treatment strategies that take individual variability into account. Even though it is not new, the impact of practicality is still deprived. If one considers blood typing, for instance, has been used to guide blood transfusions for more than a century. But the vision of applying this concept broadly has been intensely improved by the latest development of large-scale biologic databases (such as the human genome sequence), powerful methods for typifying patients (such as proteomics, metabolomics, genomics, diverse cellular assays, and even mobile health technology), and computational tools for analyzing large sets of data. Francis S.Collins et al. stated that, “What is necessary now is a broad

The IOM report supports these findings, stating that diagnostic errors contribute to 10% of patient deaths and 6-17% of hospital adverse events. Other researchers quantify the human cost of diagnostic errors at between 40,000 and 80,000 deaths per year.9 These troubling findings make developing effective methods to prevent diagnostic errors an urgent priority.

Brick has been used to create beautiful buildings for centuries. Most of these structures have a substantial history of outstanding performance. In some instances the appearance is affected by the development of efflorescence or stains. These may originate from materials in the brick or mortar, from adjacent materials, and from outside sourc- es such as cleaning agents. Each has a particular chemical composition and a unique means of removal.

Some countries may place limits on the frequency and magnitude of price increments, or even impose a price freeze or price reduction (161,184). In the latter, pharmaceutical prices cannot be raised for a predetermined period of time unless there is a justification. For example, since August 2010 (and at least until 2022), Germany has implemented a moratorium to halt price increase for medicines that are not subject to reference pricing, except for inflation (185).

The prevailing models of emergency medical transport used in North America and Western Europe are quite costly and would be impractical for most low-income countries. Severe resource constraints, the poor condition of roads or trails, and a lack of fuel may dictate the utilization of a wider range of options. In the United Republic of Tanzania, for example, modes of emergency transportation include motor- boats, canoes, bicycles with trailers, tricycles with platforms, tractors with trailers, reconditioned vehicles, and ox carts (22).
Efflorescence is normally a harmless deposit of water- soluble, white salt crystals, as shown in Photo 1. In some instances efflorescence may appear on mortar joints as shown in Photo 2. Efflorescence may appear in limited areas on the surface of brickwork as shown in Photo 3 or, in extreme cases, cover the entire brickwork surface.
Proper Sizing-Firebox dimensions should be selected so that the fire fills the combustion chamber during operation. This provides greater heating efficiency. Careful consideration should be given to size of the fireplace opening best suited for the room in which it is to be located. Location and size are important not only from the standpoint of appearance, but also of operation. If the fireplace opening is too small, it may function properly but will not produce enough heat to warm the room. If the opening is too large, a fire that would fill the combustion chamber may overwhelm the room. In such a case, the firebox opening would require a larger flue area and consume larger amounts of interior air even if exterior combustion air is provided. Table 2 provides suggested widths of conventional fireplace openings appropriate for various room sizes. For example, a room with 300 ft2 (28 m2) of floor area is best served by a fireplace with an opening 30 in. (750 mm) to 36 in. (900 mm) wide.

These assignment guidelines pertain exclusively to Commercial Mobile Radio Service providers (CMRS). The IMSI Administrator directly administers only the Home Network Identity (HNI) segment of the resource. The HNI uniquely identifies the home wireless network of a FCC- licensed two-way CMRS subscriber and contains the Mobile Country Code (MCC) and the Mobile Network Code (MNC). The remaining segment of the IMSI, the Mobile Station Identification Number (MSIN), is directly administered by the wireless network licensee to which the HNI is assigned. Issue: In 1998, ITU Recommendation E.212 was modified allowing IMSI assignments to those Wireline Service Providers offering limited mobility services. As a result, HNI assignments are no longer available exclusively to CMRS providers. The current IMSI assignment and administrative guidelines do not however reflect these modifications.

In the future, we would also like to increase the size of our con(cid:3)ated dataset and possibly create a biomedical all-words disambiguation test set to test our approach. Unlike SenseClusters, our approach can be used to perform all-words disambiguation. For example, given the sentence: His weight has fluctuated during the past month. We (cid:2)rst create a instance vector containing fluctuated, past and months for the word weight and a concept vector for each of its possible concepts, (cid:147)C0005912: Body Weight(cid:148) and (cid:147)C0699807: Quantitative Concept(cid:148) us- ing their context descriptions. We then calculate the cosine between the instance vector and each of the two concept vectors. The concept whose vector has the smallest cosine score is assigned to weight. We then repeat this process for fluctuated, past and months. We also plan to explore using different contex- tual information to improve the accuracy of our approach. We are currently exploring using co- occurrence and relational information about the pos- sible CUIs in the UMLS. Our IDF stoplist exper-

receptor antagonist that affects the autonomic nervous system and reduces cardiovascular symptoms (e.g., tachycardia and hypertension) resulting from epinephrine in the circulation. Beta blockers interfere with receptor binding by catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine, of which epinephrine is the principal catecholamine affecting the cardiovascular symptoms. Propranolol is a lipophilic beta blocker that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, it can affect both somatic and CNS target tissues.

return-to-sport progression is individualised and is a function of the injury, the athlete’s age, prior SRC and level of play, and the ability to provide close supervision during the return to activity. The return-to-sport progression presented by the CISG is widely accepted but empiric, without evidence to support either the progression sequence or the time spent in each stage. In general, for young athletes, each stage of the progression should be at least 24 hours without return of symptoms before progressing to the next stage. (C)

There are many, often complicated, mechanisms of efflorescence. Simply stated, efflorescence occurs when water containing dissolved salts is brought to the surface of masonry, the water evaporates and the salts are left on the surface of the masonry. The salt solutions may migrate across surfaces of masonry units, between the mortar and units, or through the pores of the mortar or units.

Insomnia occurs in individuals of all ages and races, and has been observed across all cultures and countries.8,9 The actual prevalence of insomnia varies according to the stringency of the definition used. Insomnia symptoms occur in approximately 33% to 50% of the adult population; insomnia symptoms with dis- tress or impairment (i.e., general insomnia disorder) in 10% to 15%; and specific insomnia disorders in 5% to 10%.10 Consis- tent risk factors for insomnia include increasing age, female sex, comorbid (medical, psychiatric, sleep, and substance use) disor- ders, shift work, and possibly unemployment and lower socio- economic status. Patients with comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions are at particularly increased risk, with psychiatric and chronic pain disorders having insomnia rates as high as 50% to 75%.11-13 The risk relationship between insomnia and psychiatric disorders appears to be bidirectional; several studies have also

the fact that 11 of the 12 medicines approved by the United States Food &amp; Drug Administration (US FDA) in 2012 for various cancer indications were priced above US$ 100 000 per year. The experts asserted that the prices of these medicines were too high, unsustainable, might compromise access of needy patients to highly effective therapy, and harmful to the sustainability of national health care systems (30). Similarly, in 2015, yet another group of cancer experts have petitioned for lower medicine prices (31).

Incidentally, when you write a paper, you can expect most reviewers (and readers) to make only one pass over it. Take care to choose coherent section and sub-section titles and to write concise and comprehensive abstracts. If a reviewer cannot understand the gist after one pass, the paper will likely be rejected; if a reader cannot understand the high- lights of the paper after five minutes, the paper will likely never be read.

Participants also discovered that all RAS's can be separated in subsections or signposts, which can be arbitrary, but improve the structure of a RA. The recognized subsections were: research topic and definitions, research objectives (questions), methodological techniques, experimental set-up, object of the study (e.g. study area), main discoveries (analysed data), answers on research questions, explanation of the conclusions and further research and implications. The main RAS's are listed in a flow chart, showing main relations between different sections (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 shows the substructure of Introduction and Discussion RAS as the most important RAS's.

medicine (NMM) and OMM obtain many more hundreds of hours of manual medicine training in a wider variety of clinical settings than DCs and other DOs. This section was meant to give you a better sense of what “osteopathic manipulative medicine” entails, and hopefully it answered most of your questions regarding OMM. The effectiveness of OMM remains a topic of ongoing debate and research despite past and current efforts to lay these arguments to rest. Whether an osteo- pathic physician uses OMM in his or her practice is based entirely on preference. With that said, it is an important core discipline and primary distinction of the osteopathic profession.

of the weakest links in the system. A study in Malawi revealed that the condition of many seriously ill children arriving at clinicshadnotpreviouslybeenrecognized.Insteadofreceiving immediate emergency care they were kept waiting for long periods before being given proper treatment. This resulted in avoidable deaths and disability (28). In Mexico, verbal autopsies of 132 children who died revealed that the majority had been seen by a physician within three days of death. Poor selection of medications and late referral to tertiary care were judged to be important contributory factors in more than half the deaths (29). A qualitative study of 21 hospitals in seven developing countries found that poor triage of incoming patients and inadequate provision of emergency care jeopar- dized the lives of arriving patients (30). Fourteen of the facilities (including 10 of 13 district hospitals) did not have an adequate triage system. A comprehensive review of the management of 131 children treated at these facilities found evidenceofinappropriateordelayedtriagein8%ofcases,poor clinical assessments in 41%, and potentially harmful delays in treatment in 19%. Several international health projects aimed at improving initial triage and treatment have been instituted at district health care facilities. Most focus on the strengthening of maternal and child health. One such project produced guidelines for emergency triage and treatment (28). An evaluation of these guidelines demonstrated that they significantly decreased the time required to assess children in need of urgent medical attention (31). In Sierra Leone a health care facility was upgraded in order to enhance its ability to provide prompt medical and surgicaltreatmenttowomenwithcomplicationsofpregnancy. The annual number of obstetric procedures rose from 2 to 38 over a period of five years. During the same period the

When analyzing the data, we found that there does not exist a CUI de(cid:2)nition for a large number of pos- sible concepts. Table 5 shows the number of words in the CUI and ST de(cid:2)nitions for each concept in the NLM-WSD dataset. Only four target words have a CUI de(cid:2)nition for each possible concept. We also found the concept de(cid:2)nitions vary widely in length. The CUI de(cid:2)nitions in the UMLS come from a va- riety of sources and there may exist more than one de(cid:2)nition per source. Unlike CUI de(cid:2)nitions, there does exist an ST de(cid:2)nition for each possible con- cept. The ST de(cid:2)nitions come from the same source and are approximately the same length but they are a broad categorization. We believe this makes them too coarse grained to provide descriptive enough in- formation about their associated concepts.

Structural clay tile has been used as a backing material for cavity wall construction. Structural clay tile for this purpose should conform to ASTM C 126, ASTM C 34 Specification for Structural Clay Load-Bearing Wall Tile or ASTM C 212 for Structural Clay Facing Tile. Clay tile units under ASTM C 126 and ASTM C 212 are commonly used for the interior wythe of a cavity wall when left exposed for architectural appearance reasons.
There are many, often complicated, mechanisms of efflorescence. Simply stated, efflorescence occurs when water containing dissolved salts is brought to the surface of masonry, the water evaporates and the salts are left on the surface of the masonry. The salt solutions may migrate across surfaces of masonry units, between the mortar and units, or through the pores of the mortar or units.

The strength and moisture penetration resistance of a brick masonry cavity wall are affected by the mortar selection and compatibility with the brick units. Portland cement-lime, mortar cement, or masonry cement mortars can be used. However, mortars with an air content less than 12 percent are recommended for their superior bond strength and resistance to moisture penetration. The MSJC Code requires that the allowable flexural tensile stresses be reduced by approximately 50 percent for assemblies constructed with masonry cement mortars or portland cement-lime mortars that have air entrainment. In addition, some building codes prohibit the use of masonry cement mortars and all Type N mortars in Seismic Performance Categories D and E (formerly Seismic Zones 3 and 4). Mortar should meet the proportion requirements of ASTM C 270 Specification for Mortar for Unit Masonry as shown in Table 1. Mortar type selection should be based on project requirements, such as strength and compatibility with a particular brick unit. Types N or S mortars are typically used in brick masonry cavity walls. See Technical Notes 8 Series for more detailed information on mortar types and selection.

As reflected in the statutory new drug and new animal drug approval standards in sections 505 109 and 512 of the FD&amp;C Act and the standard for licensure under section 351 of the PHS Act, the 110 evidence that is the basis for the risk assessment of a drug differs from the evidence that is the 111 basis for an effectiveness determination. The effectiveness determination is generally intended 112 to evaluate a drug’s positive effect based on adequate and well-controlled trials designed to 113 evaluate a specific efficacy variable (or a discrete number of efficacy variables) for the purpose 114 of distinguishing the effect of the drug from other influences.11 In contrast, FDA’s premarket 115 risk assessment is intended to identify and characterize the nature, frequency, and severity of the 116 usually broad spectrum of adverse events and other risks associated with the use of a product 117 based on a range of data sources. For human drugs, the supporting data are generally not derived 118 from studies designed to test a specific safety hypothesis. The assessment is based largely on 119 observations of adverse events from studies intended to assess effectiveness and includes all 120 patients exposed to the investigational drug during its development. For animal drugs, there are 121 generally data from safety studies in the target animal, in addition to observations of adverse 122 events from studies intended to assess effectiveness.12 For both human and animal drugs, 123 relevant data are weighted and integrated, based on the nature and reliability of the data sources, 124 into a coherent assessment of what adverse reactions are reasonably associated with the use of a 125 product and, to the extent possible, their frequency and severity.13 126

Many complicated and expensive techniques have been applied extensively in literature to extract relationships and dependencies from data. These techniques generally rely on a deep parse results that gives a rich representation which is used for applications in knowledge extraction and semantics. The problem with biomedical data parsing is that there is no exhaustive tagged training corpus available to build models for efficient parsing on test data. Also, deep parsing is computationally very expensive compared to shallow parsing that uses the finite state automaton techniques. UMLS graciously provides such a shallow parser[7] that is trained on entire Medline corpus and claims to achieve over 97% accuracy.

• Mood disturbances and cognitive difficulties. Complaints of irritability, loss of interest, mild depression and anxi- ety are common among insomnia patients. Patients with chronic insomnia often complain of mental inefficiency, difficulty remembering, difficulty focusing attention, and difficulty with complex mental tasks. • Quality of life: The irritability and fatigue associated with insomnia may cause interpersonal difficulties for insomnia patients, or avoidance of such activities. Conversely, in- terpersonal difficulties may be an important contributor to insomnia problems for some individuals. Sleep and wak- ing problems may lead to restriction of daytime activities, including social events, exercise, or work. Lack of regular daytime activities and exercise may in turn contribute to insomnia. • Exacerbation of comorbid conditions. Comorbid condi- tions may cause or increase sleep difficulties. Likewise, poor sleep may exacerbate symptomatology of comorbid conditions. Sleep complaints may herald the onset of mood disorders or exacerbation of comorbid conditions. VI. Other History: A complete insomnia history also in- cludes medical, psychiatric, medication/substance, and family/ social/occupational histories. A wide range of medical (Table 5) and psychiatric (Table 6) conditions can be comorbid with

the fact that 11 of the 12 medicines approved by the United States Food &amp; Drug Administration (US FDA) in 2012 for various cancer indications were priced above US$ 100 000 per year. The experts asserted that the prices of these medicines were too high, unsustainable, might compromise access of needy patients to highly effective therapy, and harmful to the sustainability of national health care systems (30). Similarly, in 2015, yet another group of cancer experts have petitioned for lower medicine prices (31).
NOTE: Beginning with the 2016-2017 edition, estimates for specific cancer types now take into account the potential for a history of more than one cancer type. Estimates should not be compared to those from previous years. See Sources of Statistics, page 34, for more information.

•Representante Legal: É aquele que por lei ou declaração judicial está autorizado a contrair direitos e obrigações em nome de um terceiro. De acordo com o Código Civil Brasileiro Art. 1.690, compete aos pais, e na falta de um deles ao outro, com exclusividade, representar os filhos menores de dezesseis anos, bem como assis�-los até a maioridade (com o falecimento dos pais, ou sendo estes julgados ausentes, ou em caso de os pais decaírem do poder familiar, compe�rá ao tutor legal representar o menor até os dezesseis anos e assis�-lo após essa idade - Código Civil Brasileiro Art. 1.747). Dessa maneira, no caso de um paciente menor, caso este seja menor de 16 anos, apenas o representante deverá assinar este termo (“representação”). Já, caso o paciente seja maior de 16 e menor de 18, tanto o representante legal, quanto o paciente, deverão assinar este termo (“assistência”).

Sleep-inducing drugs (hypnotics) are medications specif- ically designed to induce sleepiness directly after intake. Optimal agents affect cognitive performance during this period while inducing minimal sleepiness in the waking day after use. An optimal hypnotic would have low tox- icity and addictive potential, as well a minimal side effect profile (Oswald 1970). Among the first hypnotics, and an agent still in use is chloral hydrate - the original “Mickey Finn” - slipped into the drinks of unsuspecting marks for the purposes of criminal activity. Unfortu- nately, this medication is difficult to use since the LD-50 (potentially fatal dose) is quite close to the therapeutic dose. In the years leading up to the 1970’s, rapidly acting barbiturates were commonly utilized for their hypnotic effects. Unfortunately, these medications, also drugs of abuse, had a significant danger of overdose and contrib- uted to an era that was characterized in part by deaths due to overdoses of sleeping pills. These medications and similar barbiturate-like medications [Methaqualone (Quaalude, Sopor) Glutethimide (Doriden), Ethchlor- vynol (Placidyl), Methyprylon (Nodudar)] have limited availability and are rarely used due to limited efficacy, cognitive effects, the potential for abuse and lethal tox- icity associated with overdose (Oswald 1970). Today their primary therapeutic uses include executions and fa- cilitated euthanasia (Lossignol 2008). Most currently utilized hypnotics affect the widely dis- persed negative neurotransmitter GABA. In the 1970’s benzodiazepines (GABA agonists) were first marketed as hypnotics. Some of these agents had an extremely short duration of action [Triazolam (Halcion)]. While this agent-induced minimal next day somnolence, use was as- sociated with daytime memory impairment, particularly at higher dosages (Roehrs et al. 2000; Adam and Oswald

The numbers in each block are codes for the treatment given to each animal. The purpose of such a design is to reduce heterogeneity associated with time, space and some physical varia- tion. The five animals in Block 1 would be chosen to be as similar as possible with respect to age, weight, genotype and any other variable which might influence the outcome. They would then be assigned at random to one of the five treatments. The animals would be housed in close proximity, and possibly even in the same cage, if the different treatments can be given in such a situation. When measurements are to be made on the animals, those in Block 1 would be treated as a group, with all measurements being made within a short period by the same per- son. Animals in the other blocks would likewise be selected to be as uniform as possible, but might differ in body weight or age, etc. from those in Block 1. They could be measured at a dif- ferent time, if necessary by a different person. Thus, within each block any comparison among treatments would be made on animals which are in all possible ways as similar as possible. The unwanted variation shows up as differences between blocks. This is then removed mathe- matically in the statistical analysis.

The IOM report supports these findings, stating that diagnostic errors contribute to 10% of patient deaths and 6-17% of hospital adverse events. Other researchers quantify the human cost of diagnostic errors at between 40,000 and 80,000 deaths per year.9 These troubling findings make developing effective methods to prevent diagnostic errors an urgent priority.

The key idea is that you should read the paper in up to three passes, instead of starting at the beginning and plow- ing your way to the end. Each pass accomplishes specific goals and builds upon the previous pass: The first pass gives you a general idea about the paper. The second pass lets you grasp the paper’s content, but not its details. The third pass helps you understand the paper in depth.

These assignment guidelines pertain exclusively to Commercial Mobile Radio Service providers (CMRS). The IMSI Administrator directly administers only the Home Network Identity (HNI) segment of the resource. The HNI uniquely identifies the home wireless network of a FCC- licensed two-way CMRS subscriber and contains the Mobile Country Code (MCC) and the Mobile Network Code (MNC). The remaining segment of the IMSI, the Mobile Station Identification Number (MSIN), is directly administered by the wireless network licensee to which the HNI is assigned. Issue: In 1998, ITU Recommendation E.212 was modified allowing IMSI assignments to those Wireline Service Providers offering limited mobility services. As a result, HNI assignments are no longer available exclusively to CMRS providers. The current IMSI assignment and administrative guidelines do not however reflect these modifications.

(cid:2) The panel recommends that clinicians offer multi- modal analgesia, or the use of a variety of analgesic medications and techniques combined with non- pharmacological interventions, for the treatment of postoperative pain in children and adults (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Multimodal analgesia, defined as the use of a variety of analgesic medication and techniques that target different mechanisms of action in the peripheral and/or central nervous system (which might also be combined with nonpharmacological interventions) might have ad- ditiveorsynergisticeffectsandmoreeffectivepainrelief compared with single-modality interventions. For example, clinicians might offer local anesthetic-based regional (peripheral and neuraxial) analgesic techniques in combination with systemic opioids and other analge- sics as part of a multimodal approach to perioperative pain. Because of the availability of effective nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies for postop- erative pain management, the panel suggests that clini- cians routinely incorporate around the clock nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies into multi- modal analgesia regimens. Systemic opioids might not be required in all patients. One study suggests that it shouldbeavoidedwhennotneeded,becauselimitedev- idence suggests that perioperative opioid therapy might be associated with increased likelihood of long-term opioid use, with its attendant risks.4

Concrete masonry units are usually used for the interior wythe of a cavity wall in combination with a brick masonry exterior. They may also be used as accent bands in the exterior brick wythe. Hollow or solid concrete masonry units should conform to ASTM C 55 Specification for Concrete Building Brick, ASTM C 90 Specification for Loadbearing Concrete Masonry Units or ASTM C 129 Specification for Non-Loadbearing Concrete Masonry Units. Non load- bearing concrete masonry units are usually specified for the interior wythe when the brick and block cavity wall is used as infill walls for concrete or steel frame structural systems if shear loads are not transmitted to that wythe.

OOP costs in the year of diagnosis came mostly from professional and non-inpatient facility services. Figure 8 shows the level of OOP costs by percentile for all study cancers combined. In general, patient cost-sharing is higher for out-of-network services than in-network. Not surprisingly, cancer patients in the highest decile of OOP spending also incurred the highest portion of OOP costs for out- of-network providers; conversely, patients in the lowest decile incurred the lowest portion of OOP costs for out-of-network providers.

Effective immediately, hospitals shall notify an EMS provider if a patient transported to the hospital by that provider’s EMS crew subsequently tests positive for the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus. Notification must occur within 48 hours of the positive test result. This is a change from the previous 12-hour notification requirement. Notification of a positive test result is required regardless of whether CDC’s recommended use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during transport of any individual with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 was observed. Notification shall not include the name of the patient who tested positive.

• Fatigue and sleepiness. Feelings of fatigue (low energy, physical tiredness, weariness) are more common than symptoms of sleepiness (actual tendency to fall asleep) in patients with chronic insomnia. The presence of significant sleepiness should prompt a search for other potential sleep disorders. The number, duration, and timing of naps should be thoroughly investigated, as both a consequence of in- somnia and a potential contributing factor.

Readership analysis was conducted on the 20 science journals in our data set (n(cid:1)2903). Articles published in the social sciences and humanities journals (n(cid:1)350) were omitted from the readership analysis, as many did not include abstract or full-text versions of their articles, and, in some cases, refer- ence views were added to full-text views, resulting in indeter- minate and incomparable results. Citation analyses were conducted on the entire article data set (n(cid:1)3245). A logistic regression model was used to estimate the likelihood of articles in each experimental group being cited within the first year after publication, controlling for journal and journal category effects.

• Mood disturbances and cognitive difficulties. Complaints of irritability, loss of interest, mild depression and anxi- ety are common among insomnia patients. Patients with chronic insomnia often complain of mental inefficiency, difficulty remembering, difficulty focusing attention, and difficulty with complex mental tasks. • Quality of life: The irritability and fatigue associated with insomnia may cause interpersonal difficulties for insomnia patients, or avoidance of such activities. Conversely, in- terpersonal difficulties may be an important contributor to insomnia problems for some individuals. Sleep and wak- ing problems may lead to restriction of daytime activities, including social events, exercise, or work. Lack of regular daytime activities and exercise may in turn contribute to insomnia. • Exacerbation of comorbid conditions. Comorbid condi- tions may cause or increase sleep difficulties. Likewise, poor sleep may exacerbate symptomatology of comorbid conditions. Sleep complaints may herald the onset of mood disorders or exacerbation of comorbid conditions. VI. Other History: A complete insomnia history also in- cludes medical, psychiatric, medication/substance, and family/ social/occupational histories. A wide range of medical (Table 5) and psychiatric (Table 6) conditions can be comorbid with

In this paper, we describe a novel feature space designed to effectively classify the polarity and strength of relationships extracted from biomedical abstracts. In addition to the conventional syntactic features such as unigrams and bigrams, we have also explored and constructed semantics-based sequential features. These features are constructed at three different levels: entity, phrase, and sentence. A wrapper-based method is then used to select the optimal feature sets for both polarity and strength prediction. Specifically, a multi-stage SVM classifier and an SVR predictor are built for polarity and strength prediction, respectively. Two different schemas, namely, (1 vs. all) and (2 vs. 2), are employed to build the multi-stage SVM. Finally, three different kernel functions are considered at different stage of this SVM classifier. Our intensive evaluations have shown that for polarity prediction, the (2 vs. 2) schema in general works better than the (1 vs. all). It produces the highest polarity accuracy of 0.91 when both unigrams and semantics-based sequential structures (KSS) are used, with a standard error ranging between 0.01~0.02. On the other hand, we find that for strength prediction, unigrams solely can produce satisfying results. We obtain a high accuracy of 0.96, with the standard error ranging between 0.61%~0.63% for the strength analysis. We are currently expanding our annotated corpus to facilitate further validation of the findings reported in this work. We are also integrating this module with other modules as shown in Figure 1 towards building a quantitative food-disease-gene network. Finally, we are creating an interactive user interface to visually present this network.

We used an expert provided list of 42 relevant domain terms for the Myocardial Perfusion Imaging domain (a sub-domain of nuclear cardiology) to heuristically test the coverage of our ontology terms. Of these, we found 31 exactly matching terms, 2 morphological variants and 8 phrases that contained the terms from the expert list. Out of this 42 domain terms, 1 term, ‘dyperidamole’, was not found in our ontology (dyperidamole is a drug given during pregnancy). We found that this term didn’t exist in the 618 JNC abstracts we were using. Instead, another term, diperidamole (spelling variant) existed in our term list. To do away with noise in our data, we selected terms with greater than average frequency (2.9) of the 10191 retrieved terms and set that as our threshold. We pruned the list to

istic option. Clinical diagnosis offers the advantages of ease, speed, and low cost. In areas where malaria is prevalent, clinical diagnosis usually results in all patients with fever and no apparent other cause being treated for malaria. This approach can iden- tify most patients who truly need antimalarial treat- ment, but it is also likely to misclassify many who do not (15). Over-diagnosis can be considerable and contributes to misuse of antimalarial drugs. Considerable overlap exists between the signs and

These assignment guidelines pertain exclusively to Commercial Mobile Radio Service providers (CMRS). The IMSI Administrator directly administers only the Home Network Identity (HNI) segment of the resource. The HNI uniquely identifies the home wireless network of a FCC- licensed two-way CMRS subscriber and contains the Mobile Country Code (MCC) and the Mobile Network Code (MNC). The remaining segment of the IMSI, the Mobile Station Identification Number (MSIN), is directly administered by the wireless network licensee to which the HNI is assigned. Issue: In 1998, ITU Recommendation E.212 was modified allowing IMSI assignments to those Wireline Service Providers offering limited mobility services. As a result, HNI assignments are no longer available exclusively to CMRS providers. The current IMSI assignment and administrative guidelines do not however reflect these modifications.

President Obama has recently expressed a strong conviction that “Science offers great potential for improving health”. The President has announced a research initiative that aims to accelerate progress toward a new era of precision medicine. The time is accurate for this idealistic initiative, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other partners will work to attain this vision [7]. The concept of precision medicine speaks of prevention and treatment strategies that take individual variability into account. Even though it is not new, the impact of practicality is still deprived. If one considers blood typing, for instance, has been used to guide blood transfusions for more than a century. But the vision of applying this concept broadly has been intensely improved by the latest development of large-scale biologic databases (such as the human genome sequence), powerful methods for typifying patients (such as proteomics, metabolomics, genomics, diverse cellular assays, and even mobile health technology), and computational tools for analyzing large sets of data. Francis S.Collins et al. stated that, “What is necessary now is a broad

somnolence as a side effect is reproducible in susceptible individuals (White and Rumbold 1988). Sedation is a com- mon side effect of the traditional antipsychotics, with chlorpromazine and thioridazine somewhat more sedating than haloperidol. Clinical studies have shown a high inci- dence of persistent sedation with clozapine (46%) with less frequent reports of sedation with risperidone, olanzapine, sertindole and quetiapine (Monti et al. 2016). The sed- ation associated with these agents is most likely associated with their known effects on histaminic receptors. Doxepin, a sedating psychotropic agent with pro- nounced histamine (H-1) receptor antagonism exerts at least part of its effects by antagonizing orexin (Krystal et al. 2013). Suvorexant, is an orexin antagonist designed to lower waking arousal (Norman and Anderson 2016). Currently, it is being heavily marketed as a hypnotic (Rhyne and Anderson 2015). As based on performance and driving tests, this agent is known to produce a dose-related next day increase in somnolence for all age groupings tested (Farkus 2013). Sedative drug effects on daytime sleepiness are summarized in Table 4.
During data extraction, interventions/exposures will be labelled using the exposure codes listed in the Guidelines for the search literature reviews of the 2007 WCRF/AICR expert Report1 . The interventions/exposures are allocated under the main headings and subheadings listed in Appendix 4. For example, diet modifications –e.g. diets rich in fruit and vegetables and low in fats- will be coded under “Dietary patterns” and combinations of micronutrients in supplements will be coded under “Dietary Constituents”.

Sleep-inducing drugs (hypnotics) are medications specif- ically designed to induce sleepiness directly after intake. Optimal agents affect cognitive performance during this period while inducing minimal sleepiness in the waking day after use. An optimal hypnotic would have low tox- icity and addictive potential, as well a minimal side effect profile (Oswald 1970). Among the first hypnotics, and an agent still in use is chloral hydrate - the original “Mickey Finn” - slipped into the drinks of unsuspecting marks for the purposes of criminal activity. Unfortu- nately, this medication is difficult to use since the LD-50 (potentially fatal dose) is quite close to the therapeutic dose. In the years leading up to the 1970’s, rapidly acting barbiturates were commonly utilized for their hypnotic effects. Unfortunately, these medications, also drugs of abuse, had a significant danger of overdose and contrib- uted to an era that was characterized in part by deaths due to overdoses of sleeping pills. These medications and similar barbiturate-like medications [Methaqualone (Quaalude, Sopor) Glutethimide (Doriden), Ethchlor- vynol (Placidyl), Methyprylon (Nodudar)] have limited availability and are rarely used due to limited efficacy, cognitive effects, the potential for abuse and lethal tox- icity associated with overdose (Oswald 1970). Today their primary therapeutic uses include executions and fa- cilitated euthanasia (Lossignol 2008). Most currently utilized hypnotics affect the widely dis- persed negative neurotransmitter GABA. In the 1970’s benzodiazepines (GABA agonists) were first marketed as hypnotics. Some of these agents had an extremely short duration of action [Triazolam (Halcion)]. While this agent-induced minimal next day somnolence, use was as- sociated with daytime memory impairment, particularly at higher dosages (Roehrs et al. 2000; Adam and Oswald

In the future, we would also like to increase the size of our con(cid:3)ated dataset and possibly create a biomedical all-words disambiguation test set to test our approach. Unlike SenseClusters, our approach can be used to perform all-words disambiguation. For example, given the sentence: His weight has fluctuated during the past month. We (cid:2)rst create a instance vector containing fluctuated, past and months for the word weight and a concept vector for each of its possible concepts, (cid:147)C0005912: Body Weight(cid:148) and (cid:147)C0699807: Quantitative Concept(cid:148) us- ing their context descriptions. We then calculate the cosine between the instance vector and each of the two concept vectors. The concept whose vector has the smallest cosine score is assigned to weight. We then repeat this process for fluctuated, past and months. We also plan to explore using different contex- tual information to improve the accuracy of our approach. We are currently exploring using co- occurrence and relational information about the pos- sible CUIs in the UMLS. Our IDF stoplist exper-

Based on the size of the flue selected, a preliminary damper size must be assumed. At this point in the design process, it is only necessary to decide if the damper throat area to be used will be equal to or twice the flue area. Once this decision has been made the Inlet Loss Coefficient, K 2, may be determined. If the damper throat area is equal to the flue area, K 2 is equal to 2.5. If the damper throat is twice the flue area, K 2 is equal to 1.0.

Effective immediately, hospitals shall notify an EMS provider if a patient transported to the hospital by that provider’s EMS crew subsequently tests positive for the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus. Notification must occur within 48 hours of the positive test result. This is a change from the previous 12-hour notification requirement. Notification of a positive test result is required regardless of whether CDC’s recommended use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during transport of any individual with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 was observed. Notification shall not include the name of the patient who tested positive.

This section was meant to give you a better sense of what “osteopathic manipulative medicine” entails, and hopefully it answered most of your questions regarding OMM. The effectiveness of OMM remains a topic of ongoing debate and research despite past and current efforts to lay these arguments to rest. Whether an osteo- pathic physician uses OMM in his or her practice is based entirely on preference. With that said, it is an important core discipline and primary distinction of the osteopathic profession.

There are many, often complicated, mechanisms of efflorescence. Simply stated, efflorescence occurs when water containing dissolved salts is brought to the surface of masonry, the water evaporates and the salts are left on the surface of the masonry. The salt solutions may migrate across surfaces of masonry units, between the mortar and units, or through the pores of the mortar or units.

• Mood disturbances and cognitive difficulties. Complaints of irritability, loss of interest, mild depression and anxi- ety are common among insomnia patients. Patients with chronic insomnia often complain of mental inefficiency, difficulty remembering, difficulty focusing attention, and difficulty with complex mental tasks. • Quality of life: The irritability and fatigue associated with insomnia may cause interpersonal difficulties for insomnia patients, or avoidance of such activities. Conversely, in- terpersonal difficulties may be an important contributor to insomnia problems for some individuals. Sleep and wak- ing problems may lead to restriction of daytime activities, including social events, exercise, or work. Lack of regular daytime activities and exercise may in turn contribute to insomnia. • Exacerbation of comorbid conditions. Comorbid condi- tions may cause or increase sleep difficulties. Likewise, poor sleep may exacerbate symptomatology of comorbid conditions. Sleep complaints may herald the onset of mood disorders or exacerbation of comorbid conditions. VI. Other History: A complete insomnia history also in- cludes medical, psychiatric, medication/substance, and family/ social/occupational histories.

The use of two antimalarials simultaneously, especially when the antimalarials have different mechanisms of action, has the potential for inhib- iting the development of resistance to either of the components. The efficacy of a combination of a 4-aminoquinoline drug (either chloroquine or amo- diaquine) with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine has been reviewed (43). The results of this review sug- gested that the addition of either chloroquine or amodiaquine to SP marginally improved parasitological clearance (compared with SP alone). The studies reviewed were mostly done in areas and at times when both SP and chloroquine/amodi- aquine retained a fair amount of efficacy, and it is not clear from these studies how well such a combination would act in areas where one of the components was significantly compromised. Additionally, to date, there are no data to suggest whether this slightly improved clearance would

1. The body is completely united; the person is a fully inte- grated being of body, mind and spirit. No single part of the body functions independently. Each separate part is interconnected with all others and serves to benefit the collective whole of the person. Alterations in any part of the system, including an individual’s mental and spiritual health, affect the function of the body as a whole and all other parts therein.

Antimalarial efficacy screening: in vitro and in vivo protocols. Supplemental file. animals are prepared and stained with Giemsa. Parasitemia is determined microscopically by counting 4 fields of approximately 100 erythrocytes per field. For low parasitemias (&lt;1%), up to 4000 erythrocytes have to be counted. Alternatively the parasitemia can also be determined by FACS analysis, which works particularly well for parasitemias &gt;1%. The difference between the mean value of the control group (taken as 100%) and those of the experimental groups is calculated and expressed as percent reduction (= activity) using the following equation:
The goals of treatment are to “cure” the cancer, if possible; pro- long survival; and provide the highest possible quality of life during and after treatment. A cancer is cured when all traces of the cancer have been removed from the patient’s body. Although it is usually not possible to know if the cancer is completely eradicated, for many patients, the initial course of therapy is successful and the cancer never returns. However, some cancer- free survivors must cope with the long-term effects of treatment, as well as psychological concerns such as fear of recurrence. Cancer patients, caregivers, and survivors must have the infor- mation and support they need to play an active role in decisions that affect treatment and quality of life.
We evaluate four kernel functions when building a SVM or a SVR, including linear, sigmoid, polynomial and radial-bias function (RBF). We explore a variety of kernel combinations for building the multi-stage classifiers for polarity analysis as reported in the next section.
There are many, often complicated, mechanisms of efflorescence. Simply stated, efflorescence occurs when water containing dissolved salts is brought to the surface of masonry, the water evaporates and the salts are left on the surface of the masonry. The salt solutions may migrate across surfaces of masonry units, between the mortar and units, or through the pores of the mortar or units.

The strength and moisture penetration resistance of a brick masonry cavity wall are affected by the mortar selection and compatibility with the brick units. Portland cement-lime, mortar cement, or masonry cement mortars can be used. However, mortars with an air content less than 12 percent are recommended for their superior bond strength and resistance to moisture penetration. The MSJC Code requires that the allowable flexural tensile stresses be reduced by approximately 50 percent for assemblies constructed with masonry cement mortars or portland cement-lime mortars that have air entrainment. In addition, some building codes prohibit the use of masonry cement mortars and all Type N mortars in Seismic Performance Categories D and E (formerly Seismic Zones 3 and 4). Mortar should meet the proportion requirements of ASTM C 270 Specification for Mortar for Unit Masonry as shown in Table 1. Mortar type selection should be based on project requirements, such as strength and compatibility with a particular brick unit. Types N or S mortars are typically used in brick masonry cavity walls. See Technical Notes 8 Series for more detailed information on mortar types and selection.

of the weakest links in the system. A study in Malawi revealed that the condition of many seriously ill children arriving at clinicshadnotpreviouslybeenrecognized.Insteadofreceiving immediate emergency care they were kept waiting for long periods before being given proper treatment. This resulted in avoidable deaths and disability (28). In Mexico, verbal autopsies of 132 children who died revealed that the majority had been seen by a physician within three days of death. Poor selection of medications and late referral to tertiary care were judged to be important contributory factors in more than half the deaths (29). A qualitative study of 21 hospitals in seven developing countries found that poor triage of incoming patients and inadequate provision of emergency care jeopar- dized the lives of arriving patients (30). Fourteen of the facilities (including 10 of 13 district hospitals) did not have an adequate triage system. A comprehensive review of the management of 131 children treated at these facilities found evidenceofinappropriateordelayedtriagein8%ofcases,poor clinical assessments in 41%, and potentially harmful delays in treatment in 19%. Several international health projects aimed at improving initial triage and treatment have been instituted at district health care facilities. Most focus on the strengthening of maternal and child health. One such project produced guidelines for emergency triage and treatment (28). An evaluation of these guidelines demonstrated that they significantly decreased the time required to assess children in need of urgent medical attention (31). In Sierra Leone a health care facility was upgraded in order to enhance its ability to provide prompt medical and surgicaltreatmenttowomenwithcomplicationsofpregnancy. The annual number of obstetric procedures rose from 2 to 38 over a period of five years. During the same period the

medicine when following up n candidate molecules. The numerical solutions for this equation show that at least 48 molecules are to be evaluated for this probability to exceed 90%. The MMV discovery portfolio was built and funded to deliver two new preclinical candidates per year, and allowing for a third molecule coming from else- where, then this would still require some 16 years’ invest- ment per combination, except if there is a considerable increase in success rates going forwards (and a justifica- tion for this), or significantly increased investment. The hope on the horizon is that many of the new molecules are first-in-class, and so should they fail in clinical devel- opment there will be scope for well-defined back-up pro- jects, and these are normally much more cost-effective programmes. The definition of new molecular targets also opens up new possibilities for engaging the wider research community, allowing access to resources such as the EU’s European Lead Factory, which considers molec- ular targets but not phenotypic approaches.

Canada has a national stopgap to protect consumers from price gouging. The Patient Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB), a consumer protection agency, has the authority to impose sanctions and price reductions for patented products deemed excessively priced. However, the PMPRB is hobbled in its ability to keep Canada’s drug spending low.

Some countries may place limits on the frequency and magnitude of price increments, or even impose a price freeze or price reduction (161,184). In the latter, pharmaceutical prices cannot be raised for a predetermined period of time unless there is a justification. For example, since August 2010 (and at least until 2022), Germany has implemented a moratorium to halt price increase for medicines that are not subject to reference pricing, except for inflation (185).

return-to-sport progression is individualised and is a function of the injury, the athlete’s age, prior SRC and level of play, and the ability to provide close supervision during the return to activity. The return-to-sport progression presented by the CISG is widely accepted but empiric, without evidence to support either the progression sequence or the time spent in each stage. In general, for young athletes, each stage of the progression should be at least 24 hours without return of symptoms before progressing to the next stage. (C)

The naïve interpretation of this is that no more than 13 candidate compounds would be needed for a reasonable chance of launching one new medicine, and 25 for a com- bination with two NCEs (new chemical entities). How- ever, if one aims for a 90% overall chance of success (P), the number of candidates n, each with a success probabil- ity s (8%) is described by the negative binomial distribu- tion in Eq. 1.

1. Decide when to clean. Mortar must harden prior to cleaning. It is generally best to schedule cleaning at least seven days after brickwork is completed. In some cases it may be possible to clean earlier; how- ever, effects on the masonry and influencing factors such as weather conditions and the type of brick and mortar should be carefully considered. Prolonged time periods between the completion of the masonry and cleaning should be avoided. After one month, mortar smears and splatters left on brickwork become increasingly difficult to remove. 2. Remove larger clumps of mortar using wooden paddles or nonmetallic tools. Metal tools may damage the brickwork or leave behind fragments that oxidize and cause rust stains. 3. Select the proper cleaning solution. There are many types of proprietary cleaners available that are for- mulated to remove specific stains or for use with a particular type of brick. Be careful to select cleaning products suitable for the brick, mortar and adjacent materials and follow the cleaner manufacturer’s rec- ommended instructions. Each product being considered should be evaluated as discussed previously in Trial Cleaning.

The goals of treatment are to “cure” the cancer, if possible; pro- long survival; and provide the highest possible quality of life during and after treatment. A cancer is cured when all traces of the cancer have been removed from the patient’s body. Although it is usually not possible to know if the cancer is completely eradicated, for many patients, the initial course of therapy is successful and the cancer never returns. However, some cancer- free survivors must cope with the long-term effects of treatment, as well as psychological concerns such as fear of recurrence. Cancer patients, caregivers, and survivors must have the infor- mation and support they need to play an active role in decisions that affect treatment and quality of life.

One can reasonably assert that this beneficial anxiolytic effect might have been enhanced even further under three study design conditions. First, if the inclusion criteria had required each patient to have a high anxiety score prior to the procedure, for instance a minimum of 7 points (with 10 as the maximum), there would have been a greater potential for a difference pre-treatment vs. during the procedure. The six responders had a baseline average of 6.3 points, so there was room for improvement. Of the six responders, two subjects had low baseline anxiety scores (i.e., patient F at 4 points and patient I at 2 points). A higher baseline inclusion parameter could have increased the differential prior to vs. during the EMG procedure. Second, there might not have been a sufficiently long waiting period between the drug administration and the procedure. One can reasonably assert that if the time interval between dosing and the procedure was increased to a minimum of 30 minutes or more (from the 10 – 20 minutes), the percentage of responders and the magnitude of the response could have been greater. However, it should be noted that often in a clinic time-is-of-the-essence between the patient’s initial assessment by the medical provider and the subsequent medical procedure. Some medical providers are willing to pre-treat an anxious patient, typically with an oral benzodiazepine either swallowed intact or pre-dissolved in water, and then have him/her wait (e.g., 30 + min.) for an anxiolytic effect to be acknowledged by the patient. But, some physicians and dentists might be under time constraints or might not be willing to oblige the patient this waiting period. This would not be an obstacle if either the drug has a rapid onset of effect or the patient were to pre-treat themselves immediately prior to arrival at the physician’s office, for instance 30-60 minutes in advance. Even under the conditions of this study that the authors consider might have been sub-optimal, this drug combo delivered by the oral mucosal route provided a rapid onset effect as a PRN medication. This anxiolytic benefit may be useful in treating anticipatory anxiety either in-office or prior to arrival. There is a third limitation to this study to consider. The compounded medicine contained 25 mg of atenolol and 0.2 mg of scopolamine HBr.

Osteopathic medical schools also use differing cri- teria when selecting candidates to interview and/or extending offers of admission. For example, in the eval- uation of applicants, osteopathic medical schools place more emphasis on candidates’ interest in and knowledge of osteopathic philosophy. They also are more likely to seek out students who are interested in pursuing careers in primary care and in rural or underserved areas.3 Osteo- pathic admissions programs often view the candidate as a
These assignment guidelines pertain exclusively to Commercial Mobile Radio Service providers (CMRS). The IMSI Administrator directly administers only the Home Network Identity (HNI) segment of the resource. The HNI uniquely identifies the home wireless network of a FCC- licensed two-way CMRS subscriber and contains the Mobile Country Code (MCC) and the Mobile Network Code (MNC). The remaining segment of the IMSI, the Mobile Station Identification Number (MSIN), is directly administered by the wireless network licensee to which the HNI is assigned. Issue: In 1998, ITU Recommendation E.212 was modified allowing IMSI assignments to those Wireline Service Providers offering limited mobility services. As a result, HNI assignments are no longer available exclusively to CMRS providers. The current IMSI assignment and administrative guidelines do not however reflect these modifications.

This approach can iden- tify most patients who truly need antimalarial treat- ment, but it is also likely to misclassify many who do not (15). Over-diagnosis can be considerable and contributes to misuse of antimalarial drugs. Considerable overlap exists between the signs and

Objectives of Phase 3. In Phase 3 the working group integrated the findings of the first 2 phases, refined the scoring system, and determined the optimal cut point to define “definite RA.” The goal of this final phase was to utilize the results of Phases 1 and 2 to develop a scoring system that would be applicable to newly presenting patients with undifferentiated inflam- matory arthritis to permit identification of those with a high probability of developing persistent and/or erosive RA. Being intended for use with newly presenting patients, the scoring system should be robust enough that it could be applied repeatedly during the early course of disease, such that a patient identified as not classifiable as having definite RA at initial presentation might be classified as having definite RA at a subsequent time point. The work was not aimed at classifying subjects with established disease, either active or inac- tive. However, the working group recognized that pa- tients may present for the first time with disease that is at a later stage and being treated. Thus, although it was not the explicit charge of the working group to provide
With some variation over time and across cancer types, care for the cancer population involves the six categories of services analyzed. The bars in Figures 2a-2c indicate that some patients had significant use of facility services in the year preceding the cancer diagnosis. For both colorectal and lung cancers, total spending on hospital inpatient increased as a percentage of total immediately following diagnosis. In all three cancers, the chemotherapy share of total spending increased rapidly in the first few months after diagnosis and, with the exception of breast cancer, continued at a fairly consistent level of around 20% of spending in subsequent years. Radiation therapy represented a small share of total spending except for breast cancer patients in the year following diagnosis.
should be particularly mindful of risk factors such as high cho- lesterol, high blood pressure, obesity, and smoking. Consultation about fertility risks prior to treatment and referral for sperm banking as appropriate are both important in promoting qual- ity of life outcomes.

the top 10. We also extract and treat as binary features four different types of subjects from Altmetric and CrossRef: Medline subject codes for journal (Altmetric), subjects as indexed by SCOPUS (Altmetric), publisher subjects (Altmetric), and CrossRef subjects. Subjects are mostly at the granularity of the journal or higher. Similar journals have subjects in com- mon, with, for instance, the journals Nature Conservation, Conservation Biology, Ecology and Evolution, and many more sharing the CrossRef subject “nature and landscape conservation.”Multidisciplinaryjournals,suchasPNASand Nature, are often tagged with more general subjects such as “science” or “multidisciplinary.” Table 2 displays the top 10 CrossRef subjects describing at least 100 articles by aver- age news coverage. As expected, health related subjects top the list, along with those related to the environment. Unfor- tunately, but as expected, “general computer science” and “computational mathematics” secured the last places, at 0.5 and 0.3 news articles on average, respectively. We also extract textual features, when available, for each document: Title, Abstract, Press Release. For scientific ar- ticles with more than one press release, we randomly select one. For each type of text document, we preprocess using a standard English stop word list, extracting counts of un- igrams and bigrams, keeping tokens which appear in more than one document and no more than 80% of documents of the same type in the training set. We keep the 30,000 most frequently occurring features in the training set. We then scale the vectors of counts by tfidf weights fit on the training set. Finally, we create a boolean feature hasPR indicating whether the scientific article received coverage on one of the two prominent press release aggregation websites, Eu- rekAlert! or Science Daily. We hypothesize that mention on one of these would expose the scientific article to more jour- nalists and thus garner more coverage.

The goals of treatment are to “cure” the cancer, if possible; pro- long survival; and provide the highest possible quality of life during and after treatment. A cancer is cured when all traces of the cancer have been removed from the patient’s body. Although it is usually not possible to know if the cancer is completely eradicated, for many patients, the initial course of therapy is successful and the cancer never returns. However, some cancer- free survivors must cope with the long-term effects of treatment, as well as psychological concerns such as fear of recurrence. Cancer patients, caregivers, and survivors must have the infor- mation and support they need to play an active role in decisions that affect treatment and quality of life.

In this paper, we describe a novel feature space designed to effectively classify the polarity and strength of relationships extracted from biomedical abstracts. In addition to the conventional syntactic features such as unigrams and bigrams, we have also explored and constructed semantics-based sequential features. These features are constructed at three different levels: entity, phrase, and sentence. A wrapper-based method is then used to select the optimal feature sets for both polarity and strength prediction. Specifically, a multi-stage SVM classifier and an SVR predictor are built for polarity and strength prediction, respectively. Two different schemas, namely, (1 vs. all) and (2 vs. 2), are employed to build the multi-stage SVM. Finally, three different kernel functions are considered at different stage of this SVM classifier. Our intensive evaluations have shown that for polarity prediction, the (2 vs. 2) schema in general works better than the (1 vs. all). It produces the highest polarity accuracy of 0.91 when both unigrams and semantics-based sequential structures (KSS) are used, with a standard error ranging between 0.01~0.02. On the other hand, we find that for strength prediction, unigrams solely can produce satisfying results. We obtain a high accuracy of 0.96, with the standard error ranging between 0.61%~0.63% for the strength analysis. We are currently expanding our annotated corpus to facilitate further validation of the findings reported in this work. We are also integrating this module with other modules as shown in Figure 1 towards building a quantitative food-disease-gene network. Finally, we are creating an interactive user interface to visually present this network.

Results from the tests showed that the average value of critical thinking ability to the average achievement after the testing ended, showed the relationship was statistically significant (.05). As a result, the researchers compared the results of Table 4 and determined that after the posttest, data showed the average of critical thinking ability and post-learning achievement were higher than before the study.
For the (2 vs. 2) SVM schema, one can observe from Table 6 that the highest overall accuracy is 0.91 and generated by a feature combination of POS-based unigrams and K-array semantics-based sequential features, regardless of whether WordNet is used to correct the POS of a unigram or not. In terms of the kernel functions, a linear kernel is used at the first level of the SVM model and a polynomial kernel at the second level. In addition, we notice that the inclusion of bigrams (the last four rows in Table 6) does not improve accuracy but rather reduce the accuracy. This agrees with results reported in previous studies. Tables 7 and 8 present the confusion matrices resulted from the two best feature sets using the (2 vs. 2) SVM schema. These two tables elaborate the two optimal feature sets as highlighted in Table 6. Results are obtained by using a linear and a polynomial kernel at the two levels respectively and averaged over 10-fold cross validation. Notice that in certain cases, the model cannot ditinguish between positive and neutral polarities due to the reasons discussed above; while negative and no-relationship can often be correctly identified.
Readership analysis was conducted on the 20 science journals in our data set (n(cid:1)2903). Articles published in the social sciences and humanities journals (n(cid:1)350) were omitted from the readership analysis, as many did not include abstract or full-text versions of their articles, and, in some cases, refer- ence views were added to full-text views, resulting in indeter- minate and incomparable results. Citation analyses were conducted on the entire article data set (n(cid:1)3245). A logistic regression model was used to estimate the likelihood of articles in each experimental group being cited within the first year after publication, controlling for journal and journal category effects.

The IOM report supports these findings, stating that diagnostic errors contribute to 10% of patient deaths and 6-17% of hospital adverse events. Other researchers quantify the human cost of diagnostic errors at between 40,000 and 80,000 deaths per year.9 These troubling findings make developing effective methods to prevent diagnostic errors an urgent priority.
Structural clay tile has been used as a backing material for cavity wall construction. Structural clay tile for this purpose should conform to ASTM C 126, ASTM C 34 Specification for Structural Clay Load-Bearing Wall Tile or ASTM C 212 for Structural Clay Facing Tile. Clay tile units under ASTM C 126 and ASTM C 212 are commonly used for the interior wythe of a cavity wall when left exposed for architectural appearance reasons.

(cid:2) The panel recommends that clinicians offer multi- modal analgesia, or the use of a variety of analgesic medications and techniques combined with non- pharmacological interventions, for the treatment of postoperative pain in children and adults (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Multimodal analgesia, defined as the use of a variety of analgesic medication and techniques that target different mechanisms of action in the peripheral and/or central nervous system (which might also be combined with nonpharmacological interventions) might have ad- ditiveorsynergisticeffectsandmoreeffectivepainrelief compared with single-modality interventions. For example, clinicians might offer local anesthetic-based regional (peripheral and neuraxial) analgesic techniques in combination with systemic opioids and other analge- sics as part of a multimodal approach to perioperative pain. Because of the availability of effective nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies for postop- erative pain management, the panel suggests that clini- cians routinely incorporate around the clock nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies into multi- modal analgesia regimens. Systemic opioids might not be required in all patients. One study suggests that it shouldbeavoidedwhennotneeded,becauselimitedev- idence suggests that perioperative opioid therapy might be associated with increased likelihood of long-term opioid use, with its attendant risks.4

In summary, public and non-profit-making sectors, and by extension tax-payers and philanthropists, have provided considerable financial and non-financial contributions towards the R&amp;D of cancer medicines. This means that in many cases, pharmaceutical companies have not incurred the full costs of R&amp;D. The pharmaceutical industry has also benefited greatly from the knowledge generated by public-sector investments in R&amp;D, and by having access to research supported by public funding at costs, if any, lower than the market value.

of care data [ 12 ] . The NCI estimate for expenditure on prostate cancer treatment in 2006 was $9.862 billion, and average Medicare payments per patient in the fi rst year after diagnosis were $11 000. It should be noted when interpreting this data that use of PSA testing for prostate cancer is more widespread in the USA than in many other countries, thus increasing the number of cases identifi ed. In addition, Medicare did not cover certain cancer care expenses such as oral medicines, commonly used to treat prostate cancer until January 2006. These out-of-pocket costs may comprise 10% of the $11 000 estimate. Direct medical expenditures are only one part of the total economic burden of cancer, as cancer- related illnesses and death lead to losses in economic productivity.

The statewide assessments in mathematics, reading, and science are used to measure whether students, and their school and district, are meeting the academic standards. Statewide assessments are one measure of how well students are doing on the content that is part of their daily instruction. It is also a measure of how well schools and districts are doing in aligning their curriculum and teaching the standards.
Clinicians should individualise adjustments based on patient-specific symptoms, symptom severity, academic demands, as well as pre-existing conditions, such as mood disorder, learning disability or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.87 88 Athletes with complicated or prolonged recovery may require a multidisciplinary team with specific expertise across the scope of concussion management.

There are many, often complicated, mechanisms of efflorescence. Simply stated, efflorescence occurs when water containing dissolved salts is brought to the surface of masonry, the water evaporates and the salts are left on the surface of the masonry. The salt solutions may migrate across surfaces of masonry units, between the mortar and units, or through the pores of the mortar or units.

1. Describing – by clearly defining what you are talking about, what specifically was involved, where it took place and under what circumstances. 2. Reflecting – reconsidering a topic by taking into account new information or a new experience, or considering other viewpoints. 3. Analyzing – examining and then explaining how something is, including comparing and contrasting different elements and understanding relationships to your subject/topic. 4. Critiquing – identifying and examining weaknesses in arguments, as well as acknowledging its strengths. It’s important to think of critiquing as ‘neutral’ and not negative. 5. Reasoning – using methods such as cause and effect to demonstrate logical thinking, as well as presenting evidence that either refutes or proves an argument.

The increase in full-text downloads for open access articles during their first year after publication suggests that the primary benefit to the nonsubscriber commu- nity is in browsing, as opposed to printing or saving, which would have been indicated by a commensurate increase in PDF downloads. The decrease in abstract views suggests a reader preference for the full docu- ment when available.

Participants also discovered that all RAS's can be separated in subsections or signposts, which can be arbitrary, but improve the structure of a RA. The recognized subsections were: research topic and definitions, research objectives (questions), methodological techniques, experimental set-up, object of the study (e.g. study area), main discoveries (analysed data), answers on research questions, explanation of the conclusions and further research and implications. The main RAS's are listed in a flow chart, showing main relations between different sections (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 shows the substructure of Introduction and Discussion RAS as the most important RAS's.

The industry also often justifies prices of medicine by stating that return on investment needs to be sufficient to incentivize the discovery of future medicines (109). To this point, the industry noted that 20% of its revenues were re-invested into R&amp;D (87).

Incidentally, when you write a paper, you can expect most reviewers (and readers) to make only one pass over it. Take care to choose coherent section and sub-section titles and to write concise and comprehensive abstracts. If a reviewer cannot understand the gist after one pass, the paper will likely be rejected; if a reader cannot understand the high- lights of the paper after five minutes, the paper will likely never be read.

receptor antagonist that affects the autonomic nervous system and reduces cardiovascular symptoms (e.g., tachycardia and hypertension) resulting from epinephrine in the circulation. Beta blockers interfere with receptor binding by catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine, of which epinephrine is the principal catecholamine affecting the cardiovascular symptoms. Propranolol is a lipophilic beta blocker that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, it can affect both somatic and CNS target tissues.

Wind turbines will be used to harness the kinetic energy of the moving air over the oceans on the OCS and convert it to electricity. Offshore winds are less turbulent (because the ocean is flat relative to onshore topography), and they tend to flow at higher speeds than onshore winds, thus allowing turbines to produce more electricity. Because the potential energy produced from the wind is directly proportional to the cube of the wind speed, increased wind speeds of only a few miles per hour can produce a significantly larger amount of electricity. For instance, a turbine at a site with an average wind speed of 16 mph would produce 50% more electricity than at a site with the same turbine and average wind speeds of 14 mph (Offshore Wind 2006).

industry for anti-infectives overall, and significantly better than for other therapeutic areas, such as neurol- ogy and oncology. One difficulty with such an analysis is that new chemotypes have an inherently higher risk than additional members of established chemical classes, other than the risks of failure due to resistance (which are higher for drugs that have been used for many years). For this review’s new analysis (Table 8), new chemotypes are separated from life-cycle management projects. The overall success rates have not changed significantly in the last 3 years, either for MMV or for the CMR benchmark, which is reassuring. The data shows that a new molecule in formal preclinical evaluation has an 8% chance of becoming part of a product.

In areas where malaria is prevalent, clinical diagnosis usually results in all patients with fever and no apparent other cause being treated for malaria. This approach can iden- tify most patients who truly need antimalarial treat- ment, but it is also likely to misclassify many who do not (15). Over-diagnosis can be considerable and contributes to misuse of antimalarial drugs. Considerable overlap exists between the signs and

There are many, often complicated, mechanisms of efflorescence. Simply stated, efflorescence occurs when water containing dissolved salts is brought to the surface of masonry, the water evaporates and the salts are left on the surface of the masonry. The salt solutions may migrate across surfaces of masonry units, between the mortar and units, or through the pores of the mortar or units.

Of note, mice under single or combined metformin treatments showed an extended survival, whereas 84% of the nontreat- ed mice succumbed within 1 week after infection (Table 1). In conclusion, metformin treatment in combi- nation with suboptimal dosage of conventional antimalarials is more efficacious in reducing parasite load.

Although, it was assumed that the 'thicker' articles with wider range of vocabulary is preferable in the editors hands, the editors (and probably the readers) prefer simple, clear and coherent writing, rather than a fancy or complex, pseudo-scientific style. Also Funkhouser and Maccoby (1971) showed that the information gain is especially enhanced by the “use of examples", i.e. it helps a lot to use some non-science material, such as everyday life parallels, historical points, etc. On the other hand, some sections, such as Introduction and Discussion, have to intrigue readers and attract interest and should therefore not be over-simplified. For example, a mysterious title can catch readers' attention and will be easily remembered (e.g.: T.Y. Li and J. Yorke named their famous paper on chaos: "The period three means chaos"). Some sections require more skill and are more important. It is approximated that from all published journal RAs in the world, only less than 5% are read in detail. However, more than 50% of abstracts are read and so the quality of an abstracts is much more important (Gordon, 1983). Therefore, the abstract should present the 'story' of the RA in miniature and should be readable standalone.

In this paper, we describe a novel feature space designed to effectively classify the polarity and strength of relationships extracted from biomedical abstracts. In addition to the conventional syntactic features such as unigrams and bigrams, we have also explored and constructed semantics-based sequential features. These features are constructed at three different levels: entity, phrase, and sentence. A wrapper-based method is then used to select the optimal feature sets for both polarity and strength prediction. Specifically, a multi-stage SVM classifier and an SVR predictor are built for polarity and strength prediction, respectively. Two different schemas, namely, (1 vs. all) and (2 vs. 2), are employed to build the multi-stage SVM. Finally, three different kernel functions are considered at different stage of this SVM classifier. Our intensive evaluations have shown that for polarity prediction, the (2 vs. 2) schema in general works better than the (1 vs. all). It produces the highest polarity accuracy of 0.91 when both unigrams and semantics-based sequential structures (KSS) are used, with a standard error ranging between 0.01~0.02. On the other hand, we find that for strength prediction, unigrams solely can produce satisfying results. We obtain a high accuracy of 0.96, with the standard error ranging between 0.61%~0.63% for the strength analysis. We are currently expanding our annotated corpus to facilitate further validation of the findings reported in this work. We are also integrating this module with other modules as shown in Figure 1 towards building a quantitative food-disease-gene network. Finally, we are creating an interactive user interface to visually present this network.

• Mood disturbances and cognitive difficulties. Complaints of irritability, loss of interest, mild depression and anxi- ety are common among insomnia patients. Patients with chronic insomnia often complain of mental inefficiency, difficulty remembering, difficulty focusing attention, and difficulty with complex mental tasks. • Quality of life: The irritability and fatigue associated with insomnia may cause interpersonal difficulties for insomnia patients, or avoidance of such activities. Conversely, in- terpersonal difficulties may be an important contributor to insomnia problems for some individuals. Sleep and wak- ing problems may lead to restriction of daytime activities, including social events, exercise, or work. Lack of regular daytime activities and exercise may in turn contribute to insomnia. • Exacerbation of comorbid conditions. Comorbid condi- tions may cause or increase sleep difficulties. Likewise, poor sleep may exacerbate symptomatology of comorbid conditions. Sleep complaints may herald the onset of mood disorders or exacerbation of comorbid conditions. VI. Other History: A complete insomnia history also in- cludes medical, psychiatric, medication/substance, and family/ social/occupational histories. A wide range of medical (Table 5) and psychiatric (Table 6) conditions can be comorbid with

There are debates about whether the returns generated from the sales of medicines, including cancer medicines, are sufficient for pharmaceutical companies to cover their past R&amp;D expenses, maintain their operations and engage in future drug discovery research. For example, some commentators have observed that the revenue generated from the sales of imatinib had exceeded the costs of R&amp;D within two years and “the revenues over the subsequent years of the patent would represent generous profits to the company” (30). Another study found that total revenue from the sales of 10 cancer medicines since approval over a median of four years (US$ 67.0 billion) was 9.3 times the total R&amp;D spending of US$ 7.2 billion (or 7.4 times using an estimated risk-adjusted R&amp;D costs of US$ 9.1 billion) (94).

prices of pharmaceuticals grew faster than the collective prices of all goods and services (Fig. 4.6a, p.61). However, the trends in the two countries began to diverge in the late 1980s where the price level of medicines continued to rise faster in the USA, while the growth rate of pharmaceutical prices in Australia seemed to have been stabilized at around 10% higher than the consumer price index. This could possibly be due to the introduction of “cost effectiveness” as a requirement before listing a medicine on the national pharmaceutical insurance scheme, so as to ensure the benefits of a given medicine were high enough to justify the price requested by the manufacturer (246). The divergence became more prominent when the Australian Government undertook further reforms of its national scheme after 2005 (247), which was implemented in response to a report that warned “in 40 years’ time, the PBS could account for 3.4% of GDP, making it the largest part of the Government’s spending on health” (248). The reforms seem to have resulted in gradual normalization of the growth rate of medicine prices in Australia to a level in line with the overall inflation rate of other consumer goods (Fig. 4.6a). In contrast, medicine prices continued to grow considerably in the USA, with the cumulative growth reaching 2.4 times the overall inflation rate of other consumer goods in 2017. Of note, the price level of prescription medicines in the USA rose in parallel with Pricing and reimbursement policies in Australia over four decades have controlled the growth rate of medicine prices.

Osteopathic medical schools also use differing cri- teria when selecting candidates to interview and/or extending offers of admission. For example, in the eval- uation of applicants, osteopathic medical schools place more emphasis on candidates’ interest in and knowledge of osteopathic philosophy. They also are more likely to seek out students who are interested in pursuing careers in primary care and in rural or underserved areas.3 Osteo- pathic admissions programs often view the candidate as a
Sexual problems after cancer treatment affect survivors of many different cancers, including breast, bladder, colorectal, prostate, and gynecological.41-44 Issues vary greatly in severity and tend not to be resolved unless specific treatments are provided, which may include medical therapies; non-hormonal, water-based lubricants and moisturizers; and psychoeducational support, group therapy, sexual counseling, marital counseling, or psychotherapy.45
WHEREAS, on March 16, 2020 the Town of Dedham, through the Board of Selectmen, Town Administrator and Board of Health, has determined that COVID-19 poses a significant, immediate threat to the public health, safety, and welfare of people residing both within and outside the Town of Dedham and, as such, has declared a Local State of Emergency; and
of care data [ 12 ] . The NCI estimate for expenditure on prostate cancer treatment in 2006 was $9.862 billion, and average Medicare payments per patient in the fi rst year after diagnosis were $11 000. It should be noted when interpreting this data that use of PSA testing for prostate cancer is more widespread in the USA than in many other countries, thus increasing the number of cases identifi ed. In addition, Medicare did not cover certain cancer care expenses such as oral medicines, commonly used to treat prostate cancer until January 2006. These out-of-pocket costs may comprise 10% of the $11 000 estimate. Direct medical expenditures are only one part of the total economic burden of cancer, as cancer- related illnesses and death lead to losses in economic productivity.

To control medicine prices, authorities in some countries have implemented regulations on mark-ups along the supply and distribution chains. The regulations may apply mark-ups to a base price (e.g. ex- manufacturer price), based on one or a combination of the following broad structures:
The numbers in each block are codes for the treatment given to each animal. The purpose of such a design is to reduce heterogeneity associated with time, space and some physical varia- tion. The five animals in Block 1 would be chosen to be as similar as possible with respect to age, weight, genotype and any other variable which might influence the outcome. They would then be assigned at random to one of the five treatments. The animals would be housed in close proximity, and possibly even in the same cage, if the different treatments can be given in such a situation. When measurements are to be made on the animals, those in Block 1 would be treated as a group, with all measurements being made within a short period by the same per- son. Animals in the other blocks would likewise be selected to be as uniform as possible, but might differ in body weight or age, etc. from those in Block 1. They could be measured at a dif- ferent time, if necessary by a different person. Thus, within each block any comparison among treatments would be made on animals which are in all possible ways as similar as possible. The unwanted variation shows up as differences between blocks. This is then removed mathe- matically in the statistical analysis.

Profit control is an effective measure to manage medicine prices insofar as the regulators have control over the supply of medicines at certain points along the supply chain. Typically, this means that the regulator needs to have full visibility of the supply and distribution chains. The regulator also needs to have the capacity and ability to enforce non-compliance. Profit control is most effective when there is a publicly- funded universal programme for the provision of medicines. In contrast, it may be much less effective in health care settings where the private sector plays a significant role in the delivery of medicines, or where the structure of supply chain is complex or under-developed (183).

Insomnia occurs in individuals of all ages and races, and has been observed across all cultures and countries.8,9 The actual prevalence of insomnia varies according to the stringency of the definition used. Insomnia symptoms occur in approximately 33% to 50% of the adult population; insomnia symptoms with dis- tress or impairment (i.e., general insomnia disorder) in 10% to 15%; and specific insomnia disorders in 5% to 10%.10 Consis- tent risk factors for insomnia include increasing age, female sex, comorbid (medical, psychiatric, sleep, and substance use) disor- ders, shift work, and possibly unemployment and lower socio- economic status. Patients with comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions are at particularly increased risk, with psychiatric and chronic pain disorders having insomnia rates as high as 50% to 75%.11-13 The risk relationship between insomnia and psychiatric disorders appears to be bidirectional; several studies have also

The FDA recently recommended that a warning be issued regarding adverse effects associated with BzRA hypnotics. These medications have been associated with reports of disruptive sleep related behaviors including sleepwalking, eating, driving, and sexual behavior. Patients should be cautioned about the potential for these adverse effects, and about the importance of allowing appropriate sleep time, using only prescribed doses and avoiding the combination of BzRA hypnotics with alcohol, other sedatives, and sleep restriction. General comments about sedatives/hypnotics:

In the late 1800s, Andrew Taylor Still identified the neuromusculoskeletal system as the key element in health maintenance and stressed preventive aspects of medi- cine in place of drug therapy. During that time, osteop- athy was truly separate and distinct from the world of allo- pathic medicine. Since then, as medicine in general has become more evidence-based and supported by research, osteopathic philosophy has evolved into a more complete and robust osteopathic medicine. The phrase “osteopathic medicine” is now the accepted term for the profession over “osteopathy,” a now-antiquated term that represents a period when Still championed a near-drugless form of manual medicine. Since its conception, osteopathic med- icine has adapted its body of knowledge to incorporate contemporary scientific thought, including germ theory, pharmacology, and other “allopathic” teachings. The cen- tral tenets of osteopathic thought, however, have been maintained and continue to guide DOs in their practice of medicine. Though interprofessional relations between MDs and DOs are better than they have ever been before, challenges still exist in terms of keeping the osteopathic tradition intact, improving the evidence basis of OMM via clinical research, and advocating for widespread recogni- tion of DOs.

somnolence as a side effect is reproducible in susceptible individuals (White and Rumbold 1988). Sedation is a com- mon side effect of the traditional antipsychotics, with chlorpromazine and thioridazine somewhat more sedating than haloperidol. Clinical studies have shown a high inci- dence of persistent sedation with clozapine (46%) with less frequent reports of sedation with risperidone, olanzapine, sertindole and quetiapine (Monti et al. 2016). The sed- ation associated with these agents is most likely associated with their known effects on histaminic receptors. Doxepin, a sedating psychotropic agent with pro- nounced histamine (H-1) receptor antagonism exerts at least part of its effects by antagonizing orexin (Krystal et al. 2013). Suvorexant, is an orexin antagonist designed to lower waking arousal (Norman and Anderson 2016). Currently, it is being heavily marketed as a hypnotic (Rhyne and Anderson 2015). As based on performance and driving tests, this agent is known to produce a dose-related next day increase in somnolence for all age groupings tested (Farkus 2013). Sedative drug effects on daytime sleepiness are summarized in Table 4.

Efflorescence is normally a harmless deposit of water- soluble, white salt crystals, as shown in Photo 1. In some instances efflorescence may appear on mortar joints as shown in Photo 2. Efflorescence may appear in limited areas on the surface of brickwork as shown in Photo 3 or, in extreme cases, cover the entire brickwork surface.
Abstract: This Technical Note describes the mechanisms leading to the formation of efflorescence, including probable sources of soluble salts and moisture. Conditions necessary to cause efflorescence to appear are presented, along with design recommendations and practices that reduce the potential for efflorescence.

• Fatigue and sleepiness. Feelings of fatigue (low energy, physical tiredness, weariness) are more common than symptoms of sleepiness (actual tendency to fall asleep) in patients with chronic insomnia. The presence of significant sleepiness should prompt a search for other potential sleep disorders. The number, duration, and timing of naps should be thoroughly investigated, as both a consequence of in- somnia and a potential contributing factor.

Recent analyses of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)- Medicare database tracked healthcare use and costs (projected to 2004 levels) from diagnosis and initial treatment [ 15 ] , in addition to a 4-year follow-up [ 17 ] , for a cohort of 81 659 elderly patients with prostate cancer who had Medicare claims from 1991 to 2003 [ 15 ] , and 1991 to 2004 [ 17 ] , respectively. Treatment in the fi rst year after diagnosis was calculated to incur costs of $21 040 per patient; $13 091 for prostate cancer-related costs and $7949 for medical costs unrelated to prostate cancer [ 15 ] . In terms of cost at each stage, as expected, there was an increase in costs from stage I to IV [ 15,17 ] . Prostate cancer-related costs over 4 years from diagnosis averaged $18 168 per patient [ 17 ] . The annual healthcare cost burden estimated in 2009 is &gt; $2.5 billion annually for initial care alone [ 17 ] .

AASM practice parameter papers are based on evidence- based review and grading of literature, often addressing a spe- cific issue or topic. Clinical guidelines provide clinicians with a working overview for disease or disorder evaluation and man- agement. These guidelines include practice parameter papers and also include areas with limited evidence in order to provide a comprehensive practice guideline. Both practice parameters and clinical guidelines define principles of practice that should meet the needs of most patients. They should not, however, be considered exhaustive, inclusive of all available methods of care, or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably expected to obtain the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding appropriateness of any specific therapy must be made by the clinician and patient in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible

Proper Sizing-Firebox dimensions should be selected so that the fire fills the combustion chamber during operation. This provides greater heating efficiency. Careful consideration should be given to size of the fireplace opening best suited for the room in which it is to be located. Location and size are important not only from the standpoint of appearance, but also of operation. If the fireplace opening is too small, it may function properly but will not produce enough heat to warm the room. If the opening is too large, a fire that would fill the combustion chamber may overwhelm the room. In such a case, the firebox opening would require a larger flue area and consume larger amounts of interior air even if exterior combustion air is provided. Table 2 provides suggested widths of conventional fireplace openings appropriate for various room sizes. For example, a room with 300 ft2 (28 m2) of floor area is best served by a fireplace with an opening 30 in. (750 mm) to 36 in. (900 mm) wide.

The naïve interpretation of this is that no more than 13 candidate compounds would be needed for a reasonable chance of launching one new medicine, and 25 for a com- bination with two NCEs (new chemical entities). How- ever, if one aims for a 90% overall chance of success (P), the number of candidates n, each with a success probabil- ity s (8%) is described by the negative binomial distribu- tion in Eq. 1.

a physician intentionally stimulates a physiologic response by CO 2 inhalation [31], sodium lactate infusion [32,33], or cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4) injection [32,34]. These chemical exposures are used as potent tools to design controlled studies with predictable levels of PA episodes. In a study with healthy volunteer subjects using carbon dioxide inhalation to provoke panic and anxiety, propranolol significantly decreased heart rate, a cardiovascular somatic symptom, but did not provide psychic anxiolytic benefit [35].
Wind turbines will be used to harness the kinetic energy of the moving air over the oceans on the OCS and convert it to electricity. Offshore winds are less turbulent (because the ocean is flat relative to onshore topography), and they tend to flow at higher speeds than onshore winds, thus allowing turbines to produce more electricity. Because the potential energy produced from the wind is directly proportional to the cube of the wind speed, increased wind speeds of only a few miles per hour can produce a significantly larger amount of electricity. For instance, a turbine at a site with an average wind speed of 16 mph would produce 50% more electricity than at a site with the same turbine and average wind speeds of 14 mph (Offshore Wind 2006).

The temperature change used for estimating thermal movements should be based on mean temperatures in the component. For solid masonry walls, tempera- tures at the center of the wall should be used. In cav- ity walls and veneers, the temperature at the center of each wythe or component should be used. In dis- continuous construction, the wythes will have different temperatures due to the separation of the wythes by an air space and perhaps insulation.

(cid:2) The panel recommends that clinicians offer multi- modal analgesia, or the use of a variety of analgesic medications and techniques combined with non- pharmacological interventions, for the treatment of postoperative pain in children and adults (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Multimodal analgesia, defined as the use of a variety of analgesic medication and techniques that target different mechanisms of action in the peripheral and/or central nervous system (which might also be combined with nonpharmacological interventions) might have ad- ditiveorsynergisticeffectsandmoreeffectivepainrelief compared with single-modality interventions. For example, clinicians might offer local anesthetic-based regional (peripheral and neuraxial) analgesic techniques in combination with systemic opioids and other analge- sics as part of a multimodal approach to perioperative pain. Because of the availability of effective nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies for postop- erative pain management, the panel suggests that clini- cians routinely incorporate around the clock nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies into multi- modal analgesia regimens. Systemic opioids might not be required in all patients. One study suggests that it shouldbeavoidedwhennotneeded,becauselimitedev- idence suggests that perioperative opioid therapy might be associated with increased likelihood of long-term opioid use, with its attendant risks.4

Sleep-inducing drugs (hypnotics) are medications specif- ically designed to induce sleepiness directly after intake. Optimal agents affect cognitive performance during this period while inducing minimal sleepiness in the waking day after use. An optimal hypnotic would have low tox- icity and addictive potential, as well a minimal side effect profile (Oswald 1970). Among the first hypnotics, and an agent still in use is chloral hydrate - the original “Mickey Finn” - slipped into the drinks of unsuspecting marks for the purposes of criminal activity. Unfortu- nately, this medication is difficult to use since the LD-50 (potentially fatal dose) is quite close to the therapeutic dose. In the years leading up to the 1970’s, rapidly acting barbiturates were commonly utilized for their hypnotic effects. Unfortunately, these medications, also drugs of abuse, had a significant danger of overdose and contrib- uted to an era that was characterized in part by deaths due to overdoses of sleeping pills. These medications and similar barbiturate-like medications [Methaqualone (Quaalude, Sopor) Glutethimide (Doriden), Ethchlor- vynol (Placidyl), Methyprylon (Nodudar)] have limited availability and are rarely used due to limited efficacy, cognitive effects, the potential for abuse and lethal tox- icity associated with overdose (Oswald 1970). Today their primary therapeutic uses include executions and fa- cilitated euthanasia (Lossignol 2008). Most currently utilized hypnotics affect the widely dis- persed negative neurotransmitter GABA. In the 1970’s benzodiazepines (GABA agonists) were first marketed as hypnotics. Some of these agents had an extremely short duration of action [Triazolam (Halcion)]. While this agent-induced minimal next day somnolence, use was as- sociated with daytime memory impairment, particularly at higher dosages (Roehrs et al. 2000; Adam and Oswald

The increase in full-text downloads for open access articles during their first year after publication suggests that the primary benefit to the nonsubscriber commu- nity is in browsing, as opposed to printing or saving, which would have been indicated by a commensurate increase in PDF downloads. The decrease in abstract views suggests a reader preference for the full docu- ment when available.

Many complicated and expensive techniques have been applied extensively in literature to extract relationships and dependencies from data. These techniques generally rely on a deep parse results that gives a rich representation which is used for applications in knowledge extraction and semantics. The problem with biomedical data parsing is that there is no exhaustive tagged training corpus available to build models for efficient parsing on test data. Also, deep parsing is computationally very expensive compared to shallow parsing that uses the finite state automaton techniques. UMLS graciously provides such a shallow parser[7] that is trained on entire Medline corpus and claims to achieve over 97% accuracy.

Composite or combination flashings are typically less expensive than sheet metal and are easier to install. The most predominant type is a thin layer of metal sandwiched between one or two layers of another material. The metal layer is usually of aluminum, copper or lead. It is covered on one or both sides with various materials, such as asphalt coatings, kraft paper, fiberglass fabric or plastic films. Product literature should be reviewed to determine whether these materials are appropriate for use in brick masonry cavity walls. Consideration should be given to compatibility with adjacent sealants, delamination due to moisture penetration and movement of the wall system.

The increase in full-text downloads for open access articles during their first year after publication suggests that the primary benefit to the nonsubscriber commu- nity is in browsing, as opposed to printing or saving, which would have been indicated by a commensurate increase in PDF downloads. The decrease in abstract views suggests a reader preference for the full docu- ment when available.

As reflected in the statutory new drug and new animal drug approval standards in sections 505 109 and 512 of the FD&amp;C Act and the standard for licensure under section 351 of the PHS Act, the 110 evidence that is the basis for the risk assessment of a drug differs from the evidence that is the 111 basis for an effectiveness determination. The effectiveness determination is generally intended 112 to evaluate a drug’s positive effect based on adequate and well-controlled trials designed to 113 evaluate a specific efficacy variable (or a discrete number of efficacy variables) for the purpose 114 of distinguishing the effect of the drug from other influences.11 In contrast, FDA’s premarket 115 risk assessment is intended to identify and characterize the nature, frequency, and severity of the 116 usually broad spectrum of adverse events and other risks associated with the use of a product 117 based on a range of data sources. For human drugs, the supporting data are generally not derived 118 from studies designed to test a specific safety hypothesis. The assessment is based largely on 119 observations of adverse events from studies intended to assess effectiveness and includes all 120 patients exposed to the investigational drug during its development. For animal drugs, there are 121 generally data from safety studies in the target animal, in addition to observations of adverse 122 events from studies intended to assess effectiveness.12 For both human and animal drugs, 123 relevant data are weighted and integrated, based on the nature and reliability of the data sources, 124 into a coherent assessment of what adverse reactions are reasonably associated with the use of a 125 product and, to the extent possible, their frequency and severity.13 126

When analyzing the data, we found that there does not exist a CUI de(cid:2)nition for a large number of pos- sible concepts. Table 5 shows the number of words in the CUI and ST de(cid:2)nitions for each concept in the NLM-WSD dataset. Only four target words have a CUI de(cid:2)nition for each possible concept. We also found the concept de(cid:2)nitions vary widely in length. The CUI de(cid:2)nitions in the UMLS come from a va- riety of sources and there may exist more than one de(cid:2)nition per source. Unlike CUI de(cid:2)nitions, there does exist an ST de(cid:2)nition for each possible con- cept. The ST de(cid:2)nitions come from the same source and are approximately the same length but they are a broad categorization. We believe this makes them too coarse grained to provide descriptive enough in- formation about their associated concepts.

medicine when following up n candidate molecules. The numerical solutions for this equation show that at least 48 molecules are to be evaluated for this probability to exceed 90%. The MMV discovery portfolio was built and funded to deliver two new preclinical candidates per year, and allowing for a third molecule coming from else- where, then this would still require some 16 years’ invest- ment per combination, except if there is a considerable increase in success rates going forwards (and a justifica- tion for this), or significantly increased investment. The hope on the horizon is that many of the new molecules are first-in-class, and so should they fail in clinical devel- opment there will be scope for well-defined back-up pro- jects, and these are normally much more cost-effective programmes. The definition of new molecular targets also opens up new possibilities for engaging the wider research community, allowing access to resources such as the EU’s European Lead Factory, which considers molec- ular targets but not phenotypic approaches.

The strength and moisture penetration resistance of a brick masonry cavity wall are affected by the mortar selection and compatibility with the brick units. Portland cement-lime, mortar cement, or masonry cement mortars can be used. However, mortars with an air content less than 12 percent are recommended for their superior bond strength and resistance to moisture penetration. The MSJC Code requires that the allowable flexural tensile stresses be reduced by approximately 50 percent for assemblies constructed with masonry cement mortars or portland cement-lime mortars that have air entrainment. In addition, some building codes prohibit the use of masonry cement mortars and all Type N mortars in Seismic Performance Categories D and E (formerly Seismic Zones 3 and 4). Mortar should meet the proportion requirements of ASTM C 270 Specification for Mortar for Unit Masonry as shown in Table 1. Mortar type selection should be based on project requirements, such as strength and compatibility with a particular brick unit. Types N or S mortars are typically used in brick masonry cavity walls. See Technical Notes 8 Series for more detailed information on mortar types and selection.

Based on the size of the flue selected, a preliminary damper size must be assumed. At this point in the design process, it is only necessary to decide if the damper throat area to be used will be equal to or twice the flue area. Once this decision has been made the Inlet Loss Coefficient, K 2, may be determined. If the damper throat area is equal to the flue area, K 2 is equal to 2.5. If the damper throat is twice the flue area, K 2 is equal to 1.0.

Wind turbines will be used to harness the kinetic energy of the moving air over the oceans on the OCS and convert it to electricity. Offshore winds are less turbulent (because the ocean is flat relative to onshore topography), and they tend to flow at higher speeds than onshore winds, thus allowing turbines to produce more electricity. Because the potential energy produced from the wind is directly proportional to the cube of the wind speed, increased wind speeds of only a few miles per hour can produce a significantly larger amount of electricity. For instance, a turbine at a site with an average wind speed of 16 mph would produce 50% more electricity than at a site with the same turbine and average wind speeds of 14 mph (Offshore Wind 2006).

The FDA recently recommended that a warning be issued regarding adverse effects associated with BzRA hypnotics. These medications have been associated with reports of disruptive sleep related behaviors including sleepwalking, eating, driving, and sexual behavior. Patients should be cautioned about the potential for these adverse effects, and about the importance of allowing appropriate sleep time, using only prescribed doses and avoiding the combination of BzRA hypnotics with alcohol, other sedatives, and sleep restriction.

In addition to return to learning and sporting environments, older athletes may need to return to driving, where subtle defi- cits could compromise safety. Most sports medicine physicians do not counsel athletes with SRC about driving.90 Driving is a complex process involving coordination of cognitive, visual and motor skills, as well as concentration, attention, visual percep- tion, insight and memory, which can all be affected by SRC.90 Little is known about the risk of driving after SRC, but prelim- inary data suggest some impairment exists when patients with concussion report they are asymptomatic.91 Currently, no widely

In the future, we would also like to increase the size of our con(cid:3)ated dataset and possibly create a biomedical all-words disambiguation test set to test our approach. Unlike SenseClusters, our approach can be used to perform all-words disambiguation. For example, given the sentence: His weight has fluctuated during the past month. We (cid:2)rst create a instance vector containing fluctuated, past and months for the word weight and a concept vector for each of its possible concepts, (cid:147)C0005912: Body Weight(cid:148) and (cid:147)C0699807: Quantitative Concept(cid:148) us- ing their context descriptions. We then calculate the cosine between the instance vector and each of the two concept vectors. The concept whose vector has the smallest cosine score is assigned to weight. We then repeat this process for fluctuated, past and months. We also plan to explore using different contex- tual information to improve the accuracy of our approach. We are currently exploring using co- occurrence and relational information about the pos- sible CUIs in the UMLS. Our IDF stoplist exper-

This section was meant to give you a better sense of what “osteopathic manipulative medicine” entails, and hopefully it answered most of your questions regarding OMM. The effectiveness of OMM remains a topic of ongoing debate and research despite past and current efforts to lay these arguments to rest. Whether an osteo- pathic physician uses OMM in his or her practice is based entirely on preference. With that said, it is an important core discipline and primary distinction of the osteopathic profession.

What is the purpose of a RA and what makes it a good one, and who decides that it is a good RA? Are there rules for easier writing? If the main function of a RA is to transfer a new knowledge on a research topic, then a good paper is the one that is clear, coherent, focused, well argued and uses language that does not have ambiguous or equivoque meaning. However, it is not only the message that is important. The RA must have a well-defined structure and function in serve like a cook-book, so the others can reproduce and repeat explained experiments. Answer research questions Give summary conclusions There are some rules that can make the writing and publishing of RAs 'easier'. Here, we summarised some 'golden' rules that should always be in the mind of an inexperienced researcher (Table 3). We put all these together to make a final list of some 40 logical steps, which can be find in the Appendix.

Alternatively the parasitemia can also be determined by FACS analysis, which works particularly well for parasitemias &gt;1%. The difference between the mean value of the control group (taken as 100%) and those of the experimental groups is calculated and expressed as percent reduction (= activity) using the following equation:

The industry also often justifies prices of medicine by stating that return on investment needs to be sufficient to incentivize the discovery of future medicines (109). To this point, the industry noted that 20% of its revenues were re-invested into R&amp;D (87).

Many complicated and expensive techniques have been applied extensively in literature to extract relationships and dependencies from data. These techniques generally rely on a deep parse results that gives a rich representation which is used for applications in knowledge extraction and semantics. The problem with biomedical data parsing is that there is no exhaustive tagged training corpus available to build models for efficient parsing on test data. Also, deep parsing is computationally very expensive compared to shallow parsing that uses the finite state automaton techniques. UMLS graciously provides such a shallow parser[7] that is trained on entire Medline corpus and claims to achieve over 97% accuracy.
O ceratocone, a degeneração marginal pelúcida e ectasia pós-cirurgia refrativa são doenças que causam afilamento e abaulamento da córnea (estrutura transparente que forma a parede anterior do globo ocular). Estas alterações provocam astigmatismo irregular com distorção visual importante. O grau de embaçamento visual vai depender do grau de astigmatismo produzido e da existência de outras alterações oculares associadas. Astigmatismo pós-transplante de córnea é um grau residual que ocorre dependendo da intera- ção entre córnea doada e receptor (coaptação, cicatrização, abertura e frouxidão de pontos no decorrer da cicatrização e sua retirada).

Results from the tests showed that the average value of critical thinking ability to the average achievement after the testing ended, showed the relationship was statistically significant (.05). As a result, the researchers compared the results of Table 4 and determined that after the posttest, data showed the average of critical thinking ability and post-learning achievement were higher than before the study.

We used an expert provided list of 42 relevant domain terms for the Myocardial Perfusion Imaging domain (a sub-domain of nuclear cardiology) to heuristically test the coverage of our ontology terms. Of these, we found 31 exactly matching terms, 2 morphological variants and 8 phrases that contained the terms from the expert list. Out of this 42 domain terms, 1 term, ‘dyperidamole’, was not found in our ontology (dyperidamole is a drug given during pregnancy). We found that this term didn’t exist in the 618 JNC abstracts we were using. Instead, another term, diperidamole (spelling variant) existed in our term list. To do away with noise in our data, we selected terms with greater than average frequency (2.9) of the 10191 retrieved terms and set that as our threshold. We pruned the list to

Canada has a national stopgap to protect consumers from price gouging. The Patient Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB), a consumer protection agency, has the authority to impose sanctions and price reductions for patented products deemed excessively priced. However, the PMPRB is hobbled in its ability to keep Canada’s drug spending low.
The inclusion of SPX Weeklys in the VIX Index calculation means that the near-term options will always have more than 23 days to expiration and the next-term options always have less than 37 days to expiration, so the resulting VIX Index value will always reflect an interpolation of σ2 1 and σ2 2 ; i.e., each individual weight is less than or equal to 1 and the sum of the weights equals 1.

The key idea is that you should read the paper in up to three passes, instead of starting at the beginning and plow- ing your way to the end. Each pass accomplishes specific goals and builds upon the previous pass: The first pass gives you a general idea about the paper. The second pass lets you grasp the paper’s content, but not its details. The third pass helps you understand the paper in depth.

Numerous alternative beta blockers are available in lieu of propranolol. Notable among these is the common drug, atenolol, that is available in oral solid dose forms ranging from 25 to 100 mg for the treatment of hypertension. Multiple doses per day may be permitted. It has been used to suppress stage fright in performers when administered orally in advance [45]. Atenolol is a beta-1 selective peripheral-acting agent without CNS effects, which should reduce the risk for asthmatic subjects [46]. Thus, atenolol might be preferred over the nonselective beta blockers for patients affected by asthma or COPD [47]. Oral atenolol at 50 - 200 mg doses suppressed heart rate by ~ 23 - 24 beats per minute (bpm) vs. ~ 10 bpm on placebo [46]. Also,

The results of using an individualized IDF stoplist for each target word show an improvement over us- ing the basic stoplist. The results of our approach using different context descriptions show that for the NLM-WSD dataset the large differences in accuracy makes it unclear which of the context descriptions performed the best.

The structural design of cavity walls should follow either rational or empirical methods. The rational design method is based on the properties of the wall materials and engineering analysis. This method may be used for any structure where high loads are likely or where tall walls are a necessity. The empirical method is generally satisfactory for one and two-story buildings consisting of light construction with limited floor spans and wall heights; and for multistory buildings where unsupported wall heights are not excessive.

With some variation over time and across cancer types, care for the cancer population involves the six categories of services analyzed. The bars in Figures 2a-2c indicate that some patients had significant use of facility services in the year preceding the cancer diagnosis. For both colorectal and lung cancers, total spending on hospital inpatient increased as a percentage of total immediately following diagnosis. In all three cancers, the chemotherapy share of total spending increased rapidly in the first few months after diagnosis and, with the exception of breast cancer, continued at a fairly consistent level of around 20% of spending in subsequent years. Radiation therapy represented a small share of total spending except for breast cancer patients in the year following diagnosis.

The efficacy of a combination of a 4-aminoquinoline drug (either chloroquine or amo- diaquine) with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine has been reviewed (43). The results of this review sug- gested that the addition of either chloroquine or amodiaquine to SP marginally improved parasitological clearance (compared with SP alone). The studies reviewed were mostly done in areas and at times when both SP and chloroquine/amodi- aquine retained a fair amount of efficacy, and it is not clear from these studies how well such a combination would act in areas where one of the components was significantly compromised. Additionally, to date, there are no data to suggest whether this slightly improved clearance would

The inclusion of SPX Weeklys in the VIX Index calculation means that the near-term options will always have more than 23 days to expiration and the next-term options always have less than 37 days to expiration, so the resulting VIX Index value will always reflect an interpolation of σ2 1 and σ2 2 ; i.e., each individual weight is less than or equal to 1 and the sum of the weights equals 1.

The goals of treatment are to “cure” the cancer, if possible; pro- long survival; and provide the highest possible quality of life during and after treatment. A cancer is cured when all traces of the cancer have been removed from the patient’s body. Although it is usually not possible to know if the cancer is completely eradicated, for many patients, the initial course of therapy is successful and the cancer never returns. However, some cancer- free survivors must cope with the long-term effects of treatment, as well as psychological concerns such as fear of recurrence. Cancer patients, caregivers, and survivors must have the infor- mation and support they need to play an active role in decisions that affect treatment and quality of life.

There are many, often complicated, mechanisms of efflorescence. Simply stated, efflorescence occurs when water containing dissolved salts is brought to the surface of masonry, the water evaporates and the salts are left on the surface of the masonry. The salt solutions may migrate across surfaces of masonry units, between the mortar and units, or through the pores of the mortar or units.

1. The body is completely united; the person is a fully inte- grated being of body, mind and spirit. No single part of the body functions independently. Each separate part is interconnected with all others and serves to benefit the collective whole of the person. Alterations in any part of the system, including an individual’s mental and spiritual health, affect the function of the body as a whole and all other parts therein.
We used an expert provided list of 42 relevant domain terms for the Myocardial Perfusion Imaging domain (a sub-domain of nuclear cardiology) to heuristically test the coverage of our ontology terms. Of these, we found 31 exactly matching terms, 2 morphological variants and 8 phrases that contained the terms from the expert list. Out of this 42 domain terms, 1 term, ‘dyperidamole’, was not found in our ontology (dyperidamole is a drug given during pregnancy). We found that this term didn’t exist in the 618 JNC abstracts we were using. Instead, another term, diperidamole (spelling variant) existed in our term list. To do away with noise in our data, we selected terms with greater than average frequency (2.9) of the 10191 retrieved terms and set that as our threshold. We pruned the list to

a physician intentionally stimulates a physiologic response by CO 2 inhalation [31], sodium lactate infusion [32,33], or cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4) injection [32,34]. These chemical exposures are used as potent tools to design controlled studies with predictable levels of PA episodes. In a study with healthy volunteer subjects using carbon dioxide inhalation to provoke panic and anxiety, propranolol significantly decreased heart rate, a cardiovascular somatic symptom, but did not provide psychic anxiolytic benefit [35].

1989). In the 1990’s newer agents were developed and marketed that had selective effects on GABA receptors in- cluding Zolpidem (Ambien), Zaleplon (Sonata), Eszopi- clone (Estorra) and Indiplon. While all hypnotics have abuse potential for individuals with addictive histories and personalities, these agents have been noted to have min- imal additive potential (Hajak et al. 2003). These agents are less likely to have deleterious side effects than most OTC treatments for insomnia, however, with increased use, more side effects including next effects on driving have been reported. This effect as well as next day re- bound insomnia has particularly been reported for higher doses of zolpidem (Verster et al. 2002). In many cases, MVA’s occurred in the period of somnolence and cogni- tive impairment during the first few hours after ingestion. Comparatively normal results on psychomotor tests can be obtained 3.25 h. after zaleplon ingestion and 6.25 h. after zopiclone ingestion (Paul et al. 2003). While these agents have excellent efficacy with minimal side effects, at higher doses these agents can exhibit benzodiazepine-like effects. Idiosyncratic reactions of persistent daytime som- nolence and/or memory loss have been reported. Some patients will report next day sedation after the nighttime use of these agents, as well as demonstrate an increased error rate in driving tests (Verster et al. 2007). Such infor- mation was forthcoming only after these drugs became generic and widely utilized in clinical practice. Most sedat- ing drugs if adopted into such widespread use would also be at least as likely to demonstrate epidemiological effects on MVA’s and MVA associated deaths. In the elderly, chronic use of sedating drugs (particularly those with anti-cholinergic side effects) can be associated with an increased risk for falls, and confusion (American Geriatrics Society 2015). Reported next day sleepiness and other side effects associated with hypnotic use are summarized in Table 3. The newer GABA-effective hypnotics are the only medications with demonstrated effectiveness in treating chronic insomnia (NIH State of the Science Conference

Canada has a national stopgap to protect consumers from price gouging. The Patient Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB), a consumer protection agency, has the authority to impose sanctions and price reductions for patented products deemed excessively priced. However, the PMPRB is hobbled in its ability to keep Canada’s drug spending low.

In summary, public and non-profit-making sectors, and by extension tax-payers and philanthropists, have provided considerable financial and non-financial contributions towards the R&amp;D of cancer medicines. This means that in many cases, pharmaceutical companies have not incurred the full costs of R&amp;D. The pharmaceutical industry has also benefited greatly from the knowledge generated by public-sector investments in R&amp;D, and by having access to research supported by public funding at costs, if any, lower than the market value.

1. Decide when to clean. Mortar must harden prior to cleaning. It is generally best to schedule cleaning at least seven days after brickwork is completed. In some cases it may be possible to clean earlier; how- ever, effects on the masonry and influencing factors such as weather conditions and the type of brick and mortar should be carefully considered. Prolonged time periods between the completion of the masonry and cleaning should be avoided. After one month, mortar smears and splatters left on brickwork become increasingly difficult to remove. 2. Remove larger clumps of mortar using wooden paddles or nonmetallic tools. Metal tools may damage the brickwork or leave behind fragments that oxidize and cause rust stains. 3. Select the proper cleaning solution. There are many types of proprietary cleaners available that are for- mulated to remove specific stains or for use with a particular type of brick. Be careful to select cleaning products suitable for the brick, mortar and adjacent materials and follow the cleaner manufacturer’s rec- ommended instructions. Each product being considered should be evaluated as discussed previously in Trial Cleaning.

samples)) / (geometric mean cpm of no drug samples). Percentage reductions are used to plot percentage inhibition of growth as a function of drug concentrations. IC 50 values are determined by linear regression analyses on the linear segments of the curves (IC 90 values can also be determined by curve-fitting and can provide an useful measure of variation between experiments). Assays are typically repeated on two or three separate occasions. Within each experiment, standard deviations are typically less than 10% of the mean. Differences in parasite stages of development can lead to up to two-fold shifts in the IC 50 values between experiments; however, these differences rarely affect the overall relationships between the parasite lines in terms of their differences in drug response 4-11 .

1989). In the 1990’s newer agents were developed and marketed that had selective effects on GABA receptors in- cluding Zolpidem (Ambien), Zaleplon (Sonata), Eszopi- clone (Estorra) and Indiplon. While all hypnotics have abuse potential for individuals with addictive histories and personalities, these agents have been noted to have min- imal additive potential (Hajak et al. 2003). These agents are less likely to have deleterious side effects than most OTC treatments for insomnia, however, with increased use, more side effects including next effects on driving have been reported. This effect as well as next day re- bound insomnia has particularly been reported for higher doses of zolpidem (Verster et al. 2002). In many cases, MVA’s occurred in the period of somnolence and cogni- tive impairment during the first few hours after ingestion. Comparatively normal results on psychomotor tests can be obtained 3.25 h. after zaleplon ingestion and 6.25 h. after zopiclone ingestion (Paul et al. 2003). While these agents have excellent efficacy with minimal side effects, at higher doses these agents can exhibit benzodiazepine-like effects. Idiosyncratic reactions of persistent daytime som- nolence and/or memory loss have been reported. Some patients will report next day sedation after the nighttime use of these agents, as well as demonstrate an increased error rate in driving tests (Verster et al. 2007). Such infor- mation was forthcoming only after these drugs became generic and widely utilized in clinical practice. Most sedat- ing drugs if adopted into such widespread use would also be at least as likely to demonstrate epidemiological effects on MVA’s and MVA associated deaths. In the elderly, chronic use of sedating drugs (particularly those with anti-cholinergic side effects) can be associated with an increased risk for falls, and confusion (American Geriatrics Society 2015). Reported next day sleepiness and other side effects associated with hypnotic use are summarized in Table 3. The newer GABA-effective hypnotics are the only medications with demonstrated effectiveness in treating chronic insomnia (NIH State of the Science Conference

Participants also discovered that all RAS's can be separated in subsections or signposts, which can be arbitrary, but improve the structure of a RA. The recognized subsections were: research topic and definitions, research objectives (questions), methodological techniques, experimental set-up, object of the study (e.g. study area), main discoveries (analysed data), answers on research questions, explanation of the conclusions and further research and implications. The main RAS's are listed in a flow chart, showing main relations between different sections (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 shows the substructure of Introduction and Discussion RAS as the most important RAS's.

prices of pharmaceuticals grew faster than the collective prices of all goods and services (Fig. 4.6a, p.61). However, the trends in the two countries began to diverge in the late 1980s where the price level of medicines continued to rise faster in the USA, while the growth rate of pharmaceutical prices in Australia seemed to have been stabilized at around 10% higher than the consumer price index. This could possibly be due to the introduction of “cost effectiveness” as a requirement before listing a medicine on the national pharmaceutical insurance scheme, so as to ensure the benefits of a given medicine were high enough to justify the price requested by the manufacturer (246). The divergence became more prominent when the Australian Government undertook further reforms of its national scheme after 2005 (247), which was implemented in response to a report that warned “in 40 years’ time, the PBS could account for 3.4% of GDP, making it the largest part of the Government’s spending on health” (248). The reforms seem to have resulted in gradual normalization of the growth rate of medicine prices in Australia to a level in line with the overall inflation rate of other consumer goods (Fig. 4.6a). In contrast, medicine prices continued to grow considerably in the USA, with the cumulative growth reaching 2.4 times the overall inflation rate of other consumer goods in 2017. Of note, the price level of prescription medicines in the USA rose in parallel with Pricing and reimbursement policies in Australia over four decades have controlled the growth rate of medicine prices.

considerable challenge in assessing, measuring and translating the value of a medicine to a price. In particular, there is no universally accepted view on what dimensions of value should be considered for the purpose of determining medicine prices. Fig. 3.8 (p.34) shows the various dimensions of value noted in the literature and government guidelines, summarized into eight themes. Common dimensions considered in health technology assessments are: clinical and public health needs for the proposed medicine, clinical evidence, economic and financial public health considerations. More debatable is whether to include as innovativeness of the medicine, and the need to incentivize future

of the weakest links in the system. A study in Malawi revealed that the condition of many seriously ill children arriving at clinicshadnotpreviouslybeenrecognized.Insteadofreceiving immediate emergency care they were kept waiting for long periods before being given proper treatment. This resulted in avoidable deaths and disability (28). In Mexico, verbal autopsies of 132 children who died revealed that the majority had been seen by a physician within three days of death. Poor selection of medications and late referral to tertiary care were judged to be important contributory factors in more than half the deaths (29). A qualitative study of 21 hospitals in seven developing countries found that poor triage of incoming patients and inadequate provision of emergency care jeopar- dized the lives of arriving patients (30). Fourteen of the facilities (including 10 of 13 district hospitals) did not have an adequate triage system. A comprehensive review of the management of 131 children treated at these facilities found evidenceofinappropriateordelayedtriagein8%ofcases,poor clinical assessments in 41%, and potentially harmful delays in treatment in 19%. Several international health projects aimed at improving initial triage and treatment have been instituted at district health care facilities. Most focus on the strengthening of maternal and child health. One such project produced guidelines for emergency triage and treatment (28). An evaluation of these guidelines demonstrated that they significantly decreased the time required to assess children in need of urgent medical attention (31). In Sierra Leone a health care facility was upgraded in order to enhance its ability to provide prompt medical and surgicaltreatmenttowomenwithcomplicationsofpregnancy. The annual number of obstetric procedures rose from 2 to 38 over a period of five years. During the same period the

Results from the tests showed that the average value of critical thinking ability to the average achievement after the testing ended, showed the relationship was statistically significant (.05). As a result, the researchers compared the results of Table 4 and determined that after the posttest, data showed the average of critical thinking ability and post-learning achievement were higher than before the study.

• Fatigue and sleepiness. Feelings of fatigue (low energy, physical tiredness, weariness) are more common than symptoms of sleepiness (actual tendency to fall asleep) in patients with chronic insomnia. The presence of significant sleepiness should prompt a search for other potential sleep disorders. The number, duration, and timing of naps should be thoroughly investigated, as both a consequence of in- somnia and a potential contributing factor.

changes in clinical status. Reassessments might be per- formed less frequently for patients with more stable pain (eg, patients who have exhibited good pain con- trol without side effects after 24 hours of stable ther- apy). Pain reassessments might be useful at the time of nursing shift changes or with new caregivers to establish a baseline and promote continuity of care, although evidence showing that routine reassessment of pain at nursing shift changes is associated with improved clinical outcomes is not available.

Proper Sizing-Firebox dimensions should be selected so that the fire fills the combustion chamber during operation. This provides greater heating efficiency. Careful consideration should be given to size of the fireplace opening best suited for the room in which it is to be located. Location and size are important not only from the standpoint of appearance, but also of operation. If the fireplace opening is too small, it may function properly but will not produce enough heat to warm the room. If the opening is too large, a fire that would fill the combustion chamber may overwhelm the room. In such a case, the firebox opening would require a larger flue area and consume larger amounts of interior air even if exterior combustion air is provided. Table 2 provides suggested widths of conventional fireplace openings appropriate for various room sizes. For example, a room with 300 ft2 (28 m2) of floor area is best served by a fireplace with an opening 30 in. (750 mm) to 36 in. (900 mm) wide.

The TSST method has been used to study the effects of oral propranolol in volunteer subjects [25-28]. The assessments of psychic anxiety can be assessed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) or other similar tools [29,30]. The somatic and psychic effects of oral propranolol were tested using the TSST method in healthy adult volunteers. Propranolol (40 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, reduced systolic blood pressure, and enhanced cognitive flexibility during stress. In another study propranolol (80 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, but paradoxically increased salivary cortisol, and did not significantly affect BP or subjective stress [25]. But, in another TSST study daily oral propranolol (80 mg) did not affect the salivary cortisol response [27].

The numbers in each block are codes for the treatment given to each animal. The purpose of such a design is to reduce heterogeneity associated with time, space and some physical varia- tion. The five animals in Block 1 would be chosen to be as similar as possible with respect to age, weight, genotype and any other variable which might influence the outcome. They would then be assigned at random to one of the five treatments. The animals would be housed in close proximity, and possibly even in the same cage, if the different treatments can be given in such a situation. When measurements are to be made on the animals, those in Block 1 would be treated as a group, with all measurements being made within a short period by the same per- son. Animals in the other blocks would likewise be selected to be as uniform as possible, but might differ in body weight or age, etc. from those in Block 1. They could be measured at a dif- ferent time, if necessary by a different person. Thus, within each block any comparison among treatments would be made on animals which are in all possible ways as similar as possible. The unwanted variation shows up as differences between blocks. This is then removed mathe- matically in the statistical analysis.

President Obama has recently expressed a strong conviction that “Science offers great potential for improving health”. The President has announced a research initiative that aims to accelerate progress toward a new era of precision medicine. The time is accurate for this idealistic initiative, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other partners will work to attain this vision [7]. The concept of precision medicine speaks of prevention and treatment strategies that take individual variability into account. Even though it is not new, the impact of practicality is still deprived. If one considers blood typing, for instance, has been used to guide blood transfusions for more than a century. But the vision of applying this concept broadly has been intensely improved by the latest development of large-scale biologic databases (such as the human genome sequence), powerful methods for typifying patients (such as proteomics, metabolomics, genomics, diverse cellular assays, and even mobile health technology), and computational tools for analyzing large sets of data. Francis S.Collins et al. stated that, “What is necessary now is a broad

ability to sleep and the daytime consequences of poor sleep, dis- torted beliefs and attitudes about the origins and meaning of the insomnia, maladaptive efforts to accommodate to the condition (e.g., schedule or lifestyle changes), and excessive time spent awake in bed. The latter behavior is of particular significance in that it often is associated with “trying hard” to fall asleep and growing frustration and tension in the face of wakefulness. Thus, the bed becomes associated with a state of waking arousal as this conditioning paradigm repeats itself night after night.

There are many, often complicated, mechanisms of efflorescence. Simply stated, efflorescence occurs when water containing dissolved salts is brought to the surface of masonry, the water evaporates and the salts are left on the surface of the masonry. The salt solutions may migrate across surfaces of masonry units, between the mortar and units, or through the pores of the mortar or units.

The FDA recently recommended that a warning be issued regarding adverse effects associated with BzRA hypnotics. These medications have been associated with reports of disruptive sleep related behaviors including sleepwalking, eating, driving, and sexual behavior. Patients should be cautioned about the potential for these adverse effects, and about the importance of allowing appropriate sleep time, using only prescribed doses and avoiding the combination of BzRA hypnotics with alcohol, other sedatives, and sleep restriction.

1. Decide when to clean. Mortar must harden prior to cleaning. It is generally best to schedule cleaning at least seven days after brickwork is completed. In some cases it may be possible to clean earlier; how- ever, effects on the masonry and influencing factors such as weather conditions and the type of brick and mortar should be carefully considered. Prolonged time periods between the completion of the masonry and cleaning should be avoided. After one month, mortar smears and splatters left on brickwork become increasingly difficult to remove. 2. Remove larger clumps of mortar using wooden paddles or nonmetallic tools. Metal tools may damage the brickwork or leave behind fragments that oxidize and cause rust stains. 3. Select the proper cleaning solution. There are many types of proprietary cleaners available that are for- mulated to remove specific stains or for use with a particular type of brick. Be careful to select cleaning products suitable for the brick, mortar and adjacent materials and follow the cleaner manufacturer’s rec- ommended instructions. Each product being considered should be evaluated as discussed previously in Trial Cleaning.
6. Identify the efflorescence. Knowing the composition of efflorescing salts is sometimes of use. Table 1, taken from Brownell’s report lists the most probable sources of efflorescing salts. Commercial testing laboratories can use X-ray diffraction, petrographic analysis or chemical analysis can, in some instances, determine both the type of salts present and their relative quantity. 7. Consider miscellaneous sources of water when all obvious sources have been eliminated. Some of these sources are: condensation within the wall, poorly directed landscape sprinklers, leaky pipes, faulty drains and condensation on heating or plumbing pipes. If necessary, condensation analysis methods are described in Technical Note 47.

We report the results for four experiments in this pa- per: i) the results of using the IDF stoplist over a ba- sic stoplist, ii) the results of our approach using dif- ferent context descriptions of the possible concepts of a target word, iii) the results of our approach com- pared to SenseClusters and Humphrey et al. (2006) using the NLM-WSD dataset, and iv) the results of our approach compared to SenseClusters using the con(cid:3)ated dataset. The results of using an individualized IDF stoplist for each target word show an improvement over us- ing the basic stoplist. The results of our approach using different context descriptions show that for the NLM-WSD dataset the large differences in accuracy makes it unclear which of the context descriptions performed the best. On the con(cid:3)ated dataset, adding the ST de(cid:2)nition to the context description improved

medicine when following up n candidate molecules. The numerical solutions for this equation show that at least 48 molecules are to be evaluated for this probability to exceed 90%. The MMV discovery portfolio was built and funded to deliver two new preclinical candidates per year, and allowing for a third molecule coming from else- where, then this would still require some 16 years’ invest- ment per combination, except if there is a considerable increase in success rates going forwards (and a justifica- tion for this), or significantly increased investment. The hope on the horizon is that many of the new molecules are first-in-class, and so should they fail in clinical devel- opment there will be scope for well-defined back-up pro- jects, and these are normally much more cost-effective programmes. The definition of new molecular targets also opens up new possibilities for engaging the wider research community, allowing access to resources such as the EU’s European Lead Factory, which considers molec- ular targets but not phenotypic approaches.

Many complicated and expensive techniques have been applied extensively in literature to extract relationships and dependencies from data. These techniques generally rely on a deep parse results that gives a rich representation which is used for applications in knowledge extraction and semantics. The problem with biomedical data parsing is that there is no exhaustive tagged training corpus available to build models for efficient parsing on test data. Also, deep parsing is computationally very expensive compared to shallow parsing that uses the finite state automaton techniques. UMLS graciously provides such a shallow parser[7] that is trained on entire Medline corpus and claims to achieve over 97% accuracy.

Readership analysis was conducted on the 20 science journals in our data set (n(cid:1)2903). Articles published in the social sciences and humanities journals (n(cid:1)350) were omitted from the readership analysis, as many did not include abstract or full-text versions of their articles, and, in some cases, refer- ence views were added to full-text views, resulting in indeter- minate and incomparable results. Citation analyses were conducted on the entire article data set (n(cid:1)3245). A logistic regression model was used to estimate the likelihood of articles in each experimental group being cited within the first year after publication, controlling for journal and journal category effects.
Composite or combination flashings are typically less expensive than sheet metal and are easier to install. The most predominant type is a thin layer of metal sandwiched between one or two layers of another material. The metal layer is usually of aluminum, copper or lead. It is covered on one or both sides with various materials, such as asphalt coatings, kraft paper, fiberglass fabric or plastic films. Product literature should be reviewed to determine whether these materials are appropriate for use in brick masonry cavity walls. Consideration should be given to compatibility with adjacent sealants, delamination due to moisture penetration and movement of the wall system.

There are many, often complicated, mechanisms of efflorescence. Simply stated, efflorescence occurs when water containing dissolved salts is brought to the surface of masonry, the water evaporates and the salts are left on the surface of the masonry. The salt solutions may migrate across surfaces of masonry units, between the mortar and units, or through the pores of the mortar or units.
As chances de melhora e os riscos de complicações variam de acordo com a lesão, tempo de evolução, presença ou não de alterações oculares prévias e/ou alterações sistêmicas concomi- tantes.

Results from the tests showed that the average value of critical thinking ability to the average achievement after the testing ended, showed the relationship was statistically significant (.05). As a result, the researchers compared the results of Table 4 and determined that after the posttest, data showed the average of critical thinking ability and post-learning achievement were higher than before the study.

of care data [ 12 ] . The NCI estimate for expenditure on prostate cancer treatment in 2006 was $9.862 billion, and average Medicare payments per patient in the fi rst year after diagnosis were $11 000. It should be noted when interpreting this data that use of PSA testing for prostate cancer is more widespread in the USA than in many other countries, thus increasing the number of cases identifi ed. In addition, Medicare did not cover certain cancer care expenses such as oral medicines, commonly used to treat prostate cancer until January 2006. These out-of-pocket costs may comprise 10% of the $11 000 estimate. Direct medical expenditures are only one part of the total economic burden of cancer, as cancer- related illnesses and death lead to losses in economic productivity.
Some countries may place limits on the frequency and magnitude of price increments, or even impose a price freeze or price reduction (161,184). In the latter, pharmaceutical prices cannot be raised for a predetermined period of time unless there is a justification. For example, since August 2010 (and at least until 2022), Germany has implemented a moratorium to halt price increase for medicines that are not subject to reference pricing, except for inflation (185).

6. Identify the efflorescence. Knowing the composition of efflorescing salts is sometimes of use. Table 1, taken from Brownell’s report lists the most probable sources of efflorescing salts. Commercial testing laboratories can use X-ray diffraction, petrographic analysis or chemical analysis can, in some instances, determine both the type of salts present and their relative quantity. 7. Consider miscellaneous sources of water when all obvious sources have been eliminated. Some of these sources are: condensation within the wall, poorly directed landscape sprinklers, leaky pipes, faulty drains and condensation on heating or plumbing pipes. If necessary, condensation analysis methods are described in Technical Note 47.

Canada has a national stopgap to protect consumers from price gouging. The Patient Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB), a consumer protection agency, has the authority to impose sanctions and price reductions for patented products deemed excessively priced. However, the PMPRB is hobbled in its ability to keep Canada’s drug spending low.

prices of pharmaceuticals grew faster than the collective prices of all goods and services (Fig. 4.6a, p.61). However, the trends in the two countries began to diverge in the late 1980s where the price level of medicines continued to rise faster in the USA, while the growth rate of pharmaceutical prices in Australia seemed to have been stabilized at around 10% higher than the consumer price index. This could possibly be due to the introduction of “cost effectiveness” as a requirement before listing a medicine on the national pharmaceutical insurance scheme, so as to ensure the benefits of a given medicine were high enough to justify the price requested by the manufacturer (246). The divergence became more prominent when the Australian Government undertook further reforms of its national scheme after 2005 (247), which was implemented in response to a report that warned “in 40 years’ time, the PBS could account for 3.4% of GDP, making it the largest part of the Government’s spending on health” (248). The reforms seem to have resulted in gradual normalization of the growth rate of medicine prices in Australia to a level in line with the overall inflation rate of other consumer goods (Fig. 4.6a). In contrast, medicine prices continued to grow considerably in the USA, with the cumulative growth reaching 2.4 times the overall inflation rate of other consumer goods in 2017. Of note, the price level of prescription medicines in the USA rose in parallel with Pricing and reimbursement policies in Australia over four decades have controlled the growth rate of medicine prices.
AASM practice parameter papers are based on evidence- based review and grading of literature, often addressing a spe- cific issue or topic. Clinical guidelines provide clinicians with a working overview for disease or disorder evaluation and man- agement. These guidelines include practice parameter papers and also include areas with limited evidence in order to provide a comprehensive practice guideline. Both practice parameters and clinical guidelines define principles of practice that should meet the needs of most patients. They should not, however, be considered exhaustive, inclusive of all available methods of care, or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably expected to obtain the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding appropriateness of any specific therapy must be made by the clinician and patient in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible

Sleep-inducing drugs (hypnotics) are medications specif- ically designed to induce sleepiness directly after intake. Optimal agents affect cognitive performance during this period while inducing minimal sleepiness in the waking day after use. An optimal hypnotic would have low tox- icity and addictive potential, as well a minimal side effect profile (Oswald 1970). Among the first hypnotics, and an agent still in use is chloral hydrate - the original “Mickey Finn” - slipped into the drinks of unsuspecting marks for the purposes of criminal activity. Unfortu- nately, this medication is difficult to use since the LD-50 (potentially fatal dose) is quite close to the therapeutic dose. In the years leading up to the 1970’s, rapidly acting barbiturates were commonly utilized for their hypnotic effects. Unfortunately, these medications, also drugs of abuse, had a significant danger of overdose and contrib- uted to an era that was characterized in part by deaths due to overdoses of sleeping pills. These medications and similar barbiturate-like medications [Methaqualone (Quaalude, Sopor) Glutethimide (Doriden), Ethchlor- vynol (Placidyl), Methyprylon (Nodudar)] have limited availability and are rarely used due to limited efficacy, cognitive effects, the potential for abuse and lethal tox- icity associated with overdose (Oswald 1970). Today their primary therapeutic uses include executions and fa- cilitated euthanasia (Lossignol 2008). Most currently utilized hypnotics affect the widely dis- persed negative neurotransmitter GABA. In the 1970’s benzodiazepines (GABA agonists) were first marketed as hypnotics. Some of these agents had an extremely short duration of action [Triazolam (Halcion)]. While this agent-induced minimal next day somnolence, use was as- sociated with daytime memory impairment, particularly at higher dosages (Roehrs et al. 2000; Adam and Oswald

There are debates about whether the returns generated from the sales of medicines, including cancer medicines, are sufficient for pharmaceutical companies to cover their past R&amp;D expenses, maintain their operations and engage in future drug discovery research. For example, some commentators have observed that the revenue generated from the sales of imatinib had exceeded the costs of R&amp;D within two years and “the revenues over the subsequent years of the patent would represent generous profits to the company” (30). Another study found that total revenue from the sales of 10 cancer medicines since approval over a median of four years (US$ 67.0 billion) was 9.3 times the total R&amp;D spending of US$ 7.2 billion (or 7.4 times using an estimated risk-adjusted R&amp;D costs of US$ 9.1 billion) (94).

The strength and moisture penetration resistance of a brick masonry cavity wall are affected by the mortar selection and compatibility with the brick units. Portland cement-lime, mortar cement, or masonry cement mortars can be used. However, mortars with an air content less than 12 percent are recommended for their superior bond strength and resistance to moisture penetration. The MSJC Code requires that the allowable flexural tensile stresses be reduced by approximately 50 percent for assemblies constructed with masonry cement mortars or portland cement-lime mortars that have air entrainment. In addition, some building codes prohibit the use of masonry cement mortars and all Type N mortars in Seismic Performance Categories D and E (formerly Seismic Zones 3 and 4). Mortar should meet the proportion requirements of ASTM C 270 Specification for Mortar for Unit Masonry as shown in Table 1. Mortar type selection should be based on project requirements, such as strength and compatibility with a particular brick unit. Types N or S mortars are typically used in brick masonry cavity walls. See Technical Notes 8 Series for more detailed information on mortar types and selection.

Studies of international regulations of drug prices and the Gant Consortium’s own analysis of the Canadian, English, and German experiences suggest that there are several “necessary but not sufficient” components of value-based drug regulations. One study of MEAs argues that key components of successful agreements include:

What is the purpose of a RA and what makes it a good one, and who decides that it is a good RA? Are there rules for easier writing? If the main function of a RA is to transfer a new knowledge on a research topic, then a good paper is the one that is clear, coherent, focused, well argued and uses language that does not have ambiguous or equivoque meaning. However, it is not only the message that is important. The RA must have a well-defined structure and function in serve like a cook-book, so the others can reproduce and repeat explained experiments. Answer research questions Give summary conclusions There are some rules that can make the writing and publishing of RAs 'easier'. Here, we summarised some 'golden' rules that should always be in the mind of an inexperienced researcher (Table 3). We put all these together to make a final list of some 40 logical steps, which can be find in the Appendix.

receptor antagonist that affects the autonomic nervous system and reduces cardiovascular symptoms (e.g., tachycardia and hypertension) resulting from epinephrine in the circulation. Beta blockers interfere with receptor binding by catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine, of which epinephrine is the principal catecholamine affecting the cardiovascular symptoms. Propranolol is a lipophilic beta blocker that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, it can affect both somatic and CNS target tissues.

Many complicated and expensive techniques have been applied extensively in literature to extract relationships and dependencies from data. These techniques generally rely on a deep parse results that gives a rich representation which is used for applications in knowledge extraction and semantics. The problem with biomedical data parsing is that there is no exhaustive tagged training corpus available to build models for efficient parsing on test data. Also, deep parsing is computationally very expensive compared to shallow parsing that uses the finite state automaton techniques. UMLS graciously provides such a shallow parser[7] that is trained on entire Medline corpus and claims to achieve over 97% accuracy.

As reflected in the statutory new drug and new animal drug approval standards in sections 505 109 and 512 of the FD&amp;C Act and the standard for licensure under section 351 of the PHS Act, the 110 evidence that is the basis for the risk assessment of a drug differs from the evidence that is the 111 basis for an effectiveness determination. The effectiveness determination is generally intended 112 to evaluate a drug’s positive effect based on adequate and well-controlled trials designed to 113 evaluate a specific efficacy variable (or a discrete number of efficacy variables) for the purpose 114 of distinguishing the effect of the drug from other influences.11 In contrast, FDA’s premarket 115 risk assessment is intended to identify and characterize the nature, frequency, and severity of the 116 usually broad spectrum of adverse events and other risks associated with the use of a product 117 based on a range of data sources. For human drugs, the supporting data are generally not derived 118 from studies designed to test a specific safety hypothesis. The assessment is based largely on 119 observations of adverse events from studies intended to assess effectiveness and includes all 120 patients exposed to the investigational drug during its development. For animal drugs, there are 121 generally data from safety studies in the target animal, in addition to observations of adverse 122 events from studies intended to assess effectiveness.12 For both human and animal drugs, 123 relevant data are weighted and integrated, based on the nature and reliability of the data sources, 124 into a coherent assessment of what adverse reactions are reasonably associated with the use of a 125 product and, to the extent possible, their frequency and severity.13 126

Dose ranging test: Here, compounds are tested at a minimum of 4 different doses (the “dose ranging, full 4-day test”, typically 100, 30, 10 and 3 mg/kg, by both s.c. and p.o. routes of administration). ED 50 and ED 90 values are calculated by plotting the log dose against probit activity (for example, using Microcal “Origin”). These reflect the drug concentrations at which 50% and 90% of suppression of parasitemia is achieved. Note that with short half-life drugs it may be necessary to dose multiple times per day. Two other parameters measured in this study are relative potency compared to an appropriate standard drug, and oral bioavailability (assessed by comparison of oral and parenteral administration).

With some variation over time and across cancer types, care for the cancer population involves the six categories of services analyzed. The bars in Figures 2a-2c indicate that some patients had significant use of facility services in the year preceding the cancer diagnosis. For both colorectal and lung cancers, total spending on hospital inpatient increased as a percentage of total immediately following diagnosis. In all three cancers, the chemotherapy share of total spending increased rapidly in the first few months after diagnosis and, with the exception of breast cancer, continued at a fairly consistent level of around 20% of spending in subsequent years. Radiation therapy represented a small share of total spending except for breast cancer patients in the year following diagnosis.
A patient’s decision to use an OON provider selection may be intentional or accidental. Reasons patients may incur OON costs include patient preference for a particular provider or specialty care center that may be out of network, the lack of network providers with appropriate specialists, and the lack of awareness or transparency about which providers are in the patient’s plan network. Common scenarios for accidental use of OON providers are emergency care or care from an OON provider working at an in-network hospital (e.g., radiologist, assistant surgeon, anesthesiologist).22 23 Figure 9 suggests that there might be significant financial consequences to the patient going out of network, which could be exacerbated if health plans remove popular cancer providers from their networks. Figure 9 also provides information on the relationship between the OON percentage (right vertical axis--relative to total spending) and total patient cost-sharing (left vertical axis). While most patients in our study reported under 10% of all OOP cost in the year of diagnosis is spent on out-of- network providers, those in the highest percentile of OOP spending incurred as much as 40% of those costs out-of-network.

Paul and Elder (2008, 2014b) asserted that critical thinking provides a vehicle for educating the mind. John Dewey would agree, as from his early work, we have increased our sense of the pragmatic basis of human thought (its instrumental nature), and especially its grounding in actual human purposes, goals, and objectives. Dewey (1910) also discussed critical thinking in terms of reflective thinking, which is an uneasiness in accepting the status quo and that critical thinking is both an emotional and intellectual component. Students must, therefore, be taught to examine, poke, question, and reflect on what they have learned. Scepticism, questioning, and reflection is essential. Dewey also stated that schools should have an intimate relationship with the community it serves. From the review of the research concerning critical thinking and what components are considered important in high school education and later a life-long learning skill, the authors developed a 5-step, critical thinking teaching process as outlined in Table 2. Input from the study’s nine experts who reviewed the model and from suggestions from other model developers, led to the selection of easy to remember letters that describe each step’s process.

the top 10. We also extract and treat as binary features four different types of subjects from Altmetric and CrossRef: Medline subject codes for journal (Altmetric), subjects as indexed by SCOPUS (Altmetric), publisher subjects (Altmetric), and CrossRef subjects. Subjects are mostly at the granularity of the journal or higher. Similar journals have subjects in com- mon, with, for instance, the journals Nature Conservation, Conservation Biology, Ecology and Evolution, and many more sharing the CrossRef subject “nature and landscape conservation.”Multidisciplinaryjournals,suchasPNASand Nature, are often tagged with more general subjects such as “science” or “multidisciplinary.” Table 2 displays the top 10 CrossRef subjects describing at least 100 articles by aver- age news coverage. As expected, health related subjects top the list, along with those related to the environment. Unfor- tunately, but as expected, “general computer science” and “computational mathematics” secured the last places, at 0.5 and 0.3 news articles on average, respectively. We also extract textual features, when available, for each document: Title, Abstract, Press Release. For scientific ar- ticles with more than one press release, we randomly select one. For each type of text document, we preprocess using a standard English stop word list, extracting counts of un- igrams and bigrams, keeping tokens which appear in more than one document and no more than 80% of documents of the same type in the training set. We keep the 30,000 most frequently occurring features in the training set. We then scale the vectors of counts by tfidf weights fit on the training set. Finally, we create a boolean feature hasPR indicating whether the scientific article received coverage on one of the two prominent press release aggregation websites, Eu- rekAlert! or Science Daily. We hypothesize that mention on one of these would expose the scientific article to more jour- nalists and thus garner more coverage.

The IOM report supports these findings, stating that diagnostic errors contribute to 10% of patient deaths and 6-17% of hospital adverse events. Other researchers quantify the human cost of diagnostic errors at between 40,000 and 80,000 deaths per year.9 These troubling findings make developing effective methods to prevent diagnostic errors an urgent priority.

Recent analyses of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)- Medicare database tracked healthcare use and costs (projected to 2004 levels) from diagnosis and initial treatment [ 15 ] , in addition to a 4-year follow-up [ 17 ] , for a cohort of 81 659 elderly patients with prostate cancer who had Medicare claims from 1991 to 2003 [ 15 ] , and 1991 to 2004 [ 17 ] , respectively. Treatment in the fi rst year after diagnosis was calculated to incur costs of $21 040 per patient; $13 091 for prostate cancer-related costs and $7949 for medical costs unrelated to prostate cancer [ 15 ] . In terms of cost at each stage, as expected, there was an increase in costs from stage I to IV [ 15,17 ] . Prostate cancer-related costs over 4 years from diagnosis averaged $18 168 per patient [ 17 ] . The annual healthcare cost burden estimated in 2009 is &gt; $2.5 billion annually for initial care alone [ 17 ] .

Sport-specific rules may not allow adequate time for evaluation, and modifying these rules remains an area for improvement within the governing bodies of some sports. (C) When the sports medicine clinician becomes aware of a poten- tial injury, the athlete is approached and a brief history of the event is obtained from the athlete and those who witnessed the event or athlete behaviour. How the athlete responds to the elements of orientation, memory, concentration and balance is evaluated, as well as speech patterns and how the athlete appears to be processing information.

Concrete masonry units are usually used for the interior wythe of a cavity wall in combination with a brick masonry exterior. They may also be used as accent bands in the exterior brick wythe. Hollow or solid concrete masonry units should conform to ASTM C 55 Specification for Concrete Building Brick, ASTM C 90 Specification for Loadbearing Concrete Masonry Units or ASTM C 129 Specification for Non-Loadbearing Concrete Masonry Units. Non load- bearing concrete masonry units are usually specified for the interior wythe when the brick and block cavity wall is used as infill walls for concrete or steel frame structural systems if shear loads are not transmitted to that wythe.

Based on the size of the flue selected, a preliminary damper size must be assumed. At this point in the design process, it is only necessary to decide if the damper throat area to be used will be equal to or twice the flue area. Once this decision has been made the Inlet Loss Coefficient, K 2, may be determined. If the damper throat area is equal to the flue area, K 2 is equal to 2.5. If the damper throat is twice the flue area, K 2 is equal to 1.0.
The prevailing models of emergency medical transport used in North America and Western Europe are quite costly and would be impractical for most low-income countries. Severe resource constraints, the poor condition of roads or trails, and a lack of fuel may dictate the utilization of a wider range of options. In the United Republic of Tanzania, for example, modes of emergency transportation include motor- boats, canoes, bicycles with trailers, tricycles with platforms, tractors with trailers, reconditioned vehicles, and ox carts (22).

Objectives of Phase 3. In Phase 3 the working group integrated the findings of the first 2 phases, refined the scoring system, and determined the optimal cut point to define “definite RA.” The goal of this final phase was to utilize the results of Phases 1 and 2 to develop a scoring system that would be applicable to newly presenting patients with undifferentiated inflam- matory arthritis to permit identification of those with a high probability of developing persistent and/or erosive RA. Being intended for use with newly presenting patients, the scoring system should be robust enough that it could be applied repeatedly during the early course of disease, such that a patient identified as not classifiable as having definite RA at initial presentation might be classified as having definite RA at a subsequent time point. The work was not aimed at classifying subjects with established disease, either active or inac- tive. However, the working group recognized that pa- tients may present for the first time with disease that is at a later stage and being treated. Thus, although it was not the explicit charge of the working group to provide

considerable challenge in assessing, measuring and translating the value of a medicine to a price. In particular, there is no universally accepted view on what dimensions of value should be considered for the purpose of determining medicine prices. Fig. 3.8 (p.34) shows the various dimensions of value noted in the literature and government guidelines, summarized into eight themes. Common dimensions considered in health technology assessments are: clinical and public health needs for the proposed medicine, clinical evidence, economic and financial public health considerations. More debatable is whether to include as innovativeness of the medicine, and the need to incentivize future

the fact that 11 of the 12 medicines approved by the United States Food &amp; Drug Administration (US FDA) in 2012 for various cancer indications were priced above US$ 100 000 per year. The experts asserted that the prices of these medicines were too high, unsustainable, might compromise access of needy patients to highly effective therapy, and harmful to the sustainability of national health care systems (30). Similarly, in 2015, yet another group of cancer experts have petitioned for lower medicine prices (31).

Proper Sizing-Firebox dimensions should be selected so that the fire fills the combustion chamber during operation. This provides greater heating efficiency. Careful consideration should be given to size of the fireplace opening best suited for the room in which it is to be located. Location and size are important not only from the standpoint of appearance, but also of operation. If the fireplace opening is too small, it may function properly but will not produce enough heat to warm the room. If the opening is too large, a fire that would fill the combustion chamber may overwhelm the room. In such a case, the firebox opening would require a larger flue area and consume larger amounts of interior air even if exterior combustion air is provided. Table 2 provides suggested widths of conventional fireplace openings appropriate for various room sizes. For example, a room with 300 ft2 (28 m2) of floor area is best served by a fireplace with an opening 30 in. (750 mm) to 36 in. (900 mm) wide.

For the (2 vs. 2) SVM schema, one can observe from Table 6 that the highest overall accuracy is 0.91 and generated by a feature combination of POS-based unigrams and K-array semantics-based sequential features, regardless of whether WordNet is used to correct the POS of a unigram or not. In terms of the kernel functions, a linear kernel is used at the first level of the SVM model and a polynomial kernel at the second level. In addition, we notice that the inclusion of bigrams (the last four rows in Table 6) does not improve accuracy but rather reduce the accuracy. This agrees with results reported in previous studies. Tables 7 and 8 present the confusion matrices resulted from the two best feature sets using the (2 vs. 2) SVM schema. These two tables elaborate the two optimal feature sets as highlighted in Table 6. Results are obtained by using a linear and a polynomial kernel at the two levels respectively and averaged over 10-fold cross validation. Notice that in certain cases, the model cannot ditinguish between positive and neutral polarities due to the reasons discussed above; while negative and no-relationship can often be correctly identified.
Some countries may place limits on the frequency and magnitude of price increments, or even impose a price freeze or price reduction (161,184). In the latter, pharmaceutical prices cannot be raised for a predetermined period of time unless there is a justification. For example, since August 2010 (and at least until 2022), Germany has implemented a moratorium to halt price increase for medicines that are not subject to reference pricing, except for inflation (185).

Phase 1. The aim of Phase 1 was to identify the contributions of clinical and laboratory variables that in practice were the most predictive of the decision to initiate DMARD therapy in a population of patients with early undifferentiated synovitis. Initiation of DMARD therapy was used as an indicator of the physician’s opinion that the patient was at risk of developing persistent and/or erosive arthritis that we would currently consider to be RA. Data on 3,115 patients from 9 early arthritis cohorts who were consid- ered not to have evidence of another possible diagnosis explaining their presentation were obtained. Between July 2007 and November 2008 an expert working group developed an analysis strategy that related an agreed- upon list of standardized clinical and laboratory vari- ables collected at baseline to the initiation of DMARD treatment within the next 12 months. MTX initiation was used as the gold standard for this purpose. The analytical process aimed to identify the independent contribution of each variable on this list and included univariate regression modeling, a subsequent principal components analysis, and a multivariate regression model that included all identified components (25). The resulting list of informative variables identified during that process and the weights based on the odds ratios are shown in Table 1. Phase 2. Phase 2 consisted of a consensus-based, decision science–informed approach, which took place between November 2008 and June 2009. The purpose of this phase was to derive a clinician-based judgment on

of care data [ 12 ] . The NCI estimate for expenditure on prostate cancer treatment in 2006 was $9.862 billion, and average Medicare payments per patient in the fi rst year after diagnosis were $11 000. It should be noted when interpreting this data that use of PSA testing for prostate cancer is more widespread in the USA than in many other countries, thus increasing the number of cases identifi ed. In addition, Medicare did not cover certain cancer care expenses such as oral medicines, commonly used to treat prostate cancer until January 2006. These out-of-pocket costs may comprise 10% of the $11 000 estimate. Direct medical expenditures are only one part of the total economic burden of cancer, as cancer- related illnesses and death lead to losses in economic productivity.

There are debates about whether the returns generated from the sales of medicines, including cancer medicines, are sufficient for pharmaceutical companies to cover their past R&amp;D expenses, maintain their operations and engage in future drug discovery research. For example, some commentators have observed that the revenue generated from the sales of imatinib had exceeded the costs of R&amp;D within two years and “the revenues over the subsequent years of the patent would represent generous profits to the company” (30). Another study found that total revenue from the sales of 10 cancer medicines since approval over a median of four years (US$ 67.0 billion) was 9.3 times the total R&amp;D spending of US$ 7.2 billion (or 7.4 times using an estimated risk-adjusted R&amp;D costs of US$ 9.1 billion) (94).

Many complicated and expensive techniques have been applied extensively in literature to extract relationships and dependencies from data. These techniques generally rely on a deep parse results that gives a rich representation which is used for applications in knowledge extraction and semantics. The problem with biomedical data parsing is that there is no exhaustive tagged training corpus available to build models for efficient parsing on test data. Also, deep parsing is computationally very expensive compared to shallow parsing that uses the finite state automaton techniques. UMLS graciously provides such a shallow parser[7] that is trained on entire Medline corpus and claims to achieve over 97% accuracy.

However, the PMPRB is hobbled in its ability to keep Canada’s drug spending low.

considerable challenge in assessing, measuring and translating the value of a medicine to a price. In particular, there is no universally accepted view on what dimensions of value should be considered for the purpose of determining medicine prices. Fig. 3.8 (p.34) shows the various dimensions of value noted in the literature and government guidelines, summarized into eight themes. Common dimensions considered in health technology assessments are: clinical and public health needs for the proposed medicine, clinical evidence, economic and financial public health considerations. More debatable is whether to include as innovativeness of the medicine, and the need to incentivize future

I understand that by signing this form, my school and I may lose valuable information about how well my student is progressing academically. As a result, my student will not receive an individual score. Refusing to participate in statewide assessments may impact the school, district, and state’s efforts to equitably distribute resources and support student learning; for the purpose of school and district accountability calculations, my student will not be considered “proficient.”

Return-to-sport progressions should be individualised based on the injury, athlete’s age, history and level of play, and the ability to provide close supervision during the return to activity, and progressions may vary between athletes. Each stage is generally 24 hours without return of concussion symptoms. Consider written clearance from a healthcare professional before return to sport as directed by local laws and regulations.3

Each separate part is interconnected with all others and serves to benefit the collective whole of the person. Alterations in any part of the system, including an individual’s mental and spiritual health, affect the function of the body as a whole and all other parts therein.

Some countries may place limits on the frequency and magnitude of price increments, or even impose a price freeze or price reduction (161,184). In the latter, pharmaceutical prices cannot be raised for a predetermined period of time unless there is a justification. For example, since August 2010 (and at least until 2022), Germany has implemented a moratorium to halt price increase for medicines that are not subject to reference pricing, except for inflation (185).
medicine (NMM) and OMM obtain many more hundreds of hours of manual medicine training in a wider variety of clinical settings than DCs and other DOs. This section was meant to give you a better sense of what “osteopathic manipulative medicine” entails, and hopefully it answered most of your questions regarding OMM. The effectiveness of OMM remains a topic of ongoing debate and research despite past and current efforts to lay these arguments to rest. Whether an osteo- pathic physician uses OMM in his or her practice is based entirely on preference. With that said, it is an important core discipline and primary distinction of the osteopathic profession.

The industry also often justifies prices of medicine by stating that return on investment needs to be sufficient to incentivize the discovery of future medicines (109). To this point, the industry noted that 20% of its revenues were re-invested into R&amp;D (87).

Reassessments might be per- formed less frequently for patients with more stable pain (eg, patients who have exhibited good pain con- trol without side effects after 24 hours of stable ther- apy). Pain reassessments might be useful at the time of nursing shift changes or with new caregivers to establish a baseline and promote continuity of care, although evidence showing that routine reassessment of pain at nursing shift changes is associated with improved clinical outcomes is not available.

Effective immediately, hospitals shall notify an EMS provider if a patient transported to the hospital by that provider’s EMS crew subsequently tests positive for the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus. Notification must occur within 48 hours of the positive test result. This is a change from the previous 12-hour notification requirement. Notification of a positive test result is required regardless of whether CDC’s recommended use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during transport of any individual with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 was observed. Notification shall not include the name of the patient who tested positive.

Concrete masonry units are usually used for the interior wythe of a cavity wall in combination with a brick masonry exterior. They may also be used as accent bands in the exterior brick wythe. Hollow or solid concrete masonry units should conform to ASTM C 55 Specification for Concrete Building Brick, ASTM C 90 Specification for Loadbearing Concrete Masonry Units or ASTM C 129 Specification for Non-Loadbearing Concrete Masonry Units. Non load- bearing concrete masonry units are usually specified for the interior wythe when the brick and block cavity wall is used as infill walls for concrete or steel frame structural systems if shear loads are not transmitted to that wythe.

Sport-specific rules may not allow adequate time for evaluation, and modifying these rules remains an area for improvement within the governing bodies of some sports. (C) When the sports medicine clinician becomes aware of a poten- tial injury, the athlete is approached and a brief history of the event is obtained from the athlete and those who witnessed the event or athlete behaviour. How the athlete responds to the elements of orientation, memory, concentration and balance is evaluated, as well as speech patterns and how the athlete appears to be processing information.

On the con(cid:3)ated dataset, the pseudowords a a, a o, d d and e e have a corresponding CUI de(cid:2)ni- tion for each of their possible concepts therefore the accuracy for CUI and CUI→ would be the same for these datasets and is not reported.

Medical misdiagnosis, in the form of inaccurate, late, and delayed diagnoses, is an ongoing problem in the U.S. Not only do these diagnostic errors present an ongoing risk to the health and safety of patients, but they also cost the economy billions of dollars.
a) The regulation gives data subjects the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, where there is a legal or similarly significant effect on the person (the regulation prohibits automated processing where there is no meaningful human involvement in the decision and where the decision either impacts one’s legal rights, or the decision has the potential to significantly influence the circumstances, behavior, or choices of the individuals concerned). b) Other considerations: i) Research affecting the healthcare a person receives, where there is no human involvement in the decision, would be considered covered under the regulation (i.e., assigning trial subjects to receive an intervention or placebo, based solely on the individual’s personal data, i.e., test results)

Assays are typically repeated on two or three separate occasions. Within each experiment, standard deviations are typically less than 10% of the mean. Differences in parasite stages of development can lead to up to two-fold shifts in the IC 50 values between experiments; however, these differences rarely affect the overall relationships between the parasite lines in terms of their differences in drug response 4-11 .

Patients who self- administer their medications or personal caregivers should visually examine the medication, confirm whether its ap- pearance meets their expectations, and compare its instruc- tions with information they received from their healthcare providers (e.g., a chemotherapy calendar).
Numerous alternative beta blockers are available in lieu of propranolol. Notable among these is the common drug, atenolol, that is available in oral solid dose forms ranging from 25 to 100 mg for the treatment of hypertension. Multiple doses per day may be permitted. It has been used to suppress stage fright in performers when administered orally in advance [45]. Atenolol is a beta-1 selective peripheral-acting agent without CNS effects, which should reduce the risk for asthmatic subjects [46]. Thus, atenolol might be preferred over the nonselective beta blockers for patients affected by asthma or COPD [47]. Oral atenolol at 50 - 200 mg doses suppressed heart rate by ~ 23 - 24 beats per minute (bpm) vs. ~ 10 bpm on placebo [46]. Also,

Profit control is an effective measure to manage medicine prices insofar as the regulators have control over the supply of medicines at certain points along the supply chain. Typically, this means that the regulator needs to have full visibility of the supply and distribution chains. The regulator also needs to have the capacity and ability to enforce non-compliance. Profit control is most effective when there is a publicly- funded universal programme for the provision of medicines. In contrast, it may be much less effective in health care settings where the private sector plays a significant role in the delivery of medicines, or where the structure of supply chain is complex or under-developed (183).

of the weakest links in the system. A study in Malawi revealed that the condition of many seriously ill children arriving at clinicshadnotpreviouslybeenrecognized.Insteadofreceiving immediate emergency care they were kept waiting for long periods before being given proper treatment. This resulted in avoidable deaths and disability (28). In Mexico, verbal autopsies of 132 children who died revealed that the majority had been seen by a physician within three days of death. Poor selection of medications and late referral to tertiary care were judged to be important contributory factors in more than half the deaths (29). A qualitative study of 21 hospitals in seven developing countries found that poor triage of incoming patients and inadequate provision of emergency care jeopar- dized the lives of arriving patients (30). Fourteen of the facilities (including 10 of 13 district hospitals) did not have an adequate triage system. A comprehensive review of the management of 131 children treated at these facilities found evidenceofinappropriateordelayedtriagein8%ofcases,poor clinical assessments in 41%, and potentially harmful delays in treatment in 19%. Several international health projects aimed at improving initial triage and treatment have been instituted at district health care facilities. Most focus on the strengthening of maternal and child health. One such project produced guidelines for emergency triage and treatment (28). An evaluation of these guidelines demonstrated that they significantly decreased the time required to assess children in need of urgent medical attention (31). In Sierra Leone a health care facility was upgraded in order to enhance its ability to provide prompt medical and surgicaltreatmenttowomenwithcomplicationsofpregnancy. The annual number of obstetric procedures rose from 2 to 38 over a period of five years. During the same period the

Brick has been used to create beautiful buildings for centuries. Most of these structures have a substantial history of outstanding performance. In some instances the appearance is affected by the development of efflorescence or stains. These may originate from materials in the brick or mortar, from adjacent materials, and from outside sourc- es such as cleaning agents. Each has a particular chemical composition and a unique means of removal.

receptor antagonist that affects the autonomic nervous system and reduces cardiovascular symptoms (e.g., tachycardia and hypertension) resulting from epinephrine in the circulation. Beta blockers interfere with receptor binding by catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine, of which epinephrine is the principal catecholamine affecting the cardiovascular symptoms. Propranolol is a lipophilic beta blocker that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, it can affect both somatic and CNS target tissues.

(cid:2) The panel recommends that clinicians offer multi- modal analgesia, or the use of a variety of analgesic medications and techniques combined with non- pharmacological interventions, for the treatment of postoperative pain in children and adults (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Multimodal analgesia, defined as the use of a variety of analgesic medication and techniques that target different mechanisms of action in the peripheral and/or central nervous system (which might also be combined with nonpharmacological interventions) might have ad- ditiveorsynergisticeffectsandmoreeffectivepainrelief compared with single-modality interventions. For example, clinicians might offer local anesthetic-based regional (peripheral and neuraxial) analgesic techniques in combination with systemic opioids and other analge- sics as part of a multimodal approach to perioperative pain. Because of the availability of effective nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies for postop- erative pain management, the panel suggests that clini- cians routinely incorporate around the clock nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies into multi- modal analgesia regimens. Systemic opioids might not be required in all patients. One study suggests that it shouldbeavoidedwhennotneeded,becauselimitedev- idence suggests that perioperative opioid therapy might be associated with increased likelihood of long-term opioid use, with its attendant risks.4

The numbers in each block are codes for the treatment given to each animal. The purpose of such a design is to reduce heterogeneity associated with time, space and some physical varia- tion. The five animals in Block 1 would be chosen to be as similar as possible with respect to age, weight, genotype and any other variable which might influence the outcome. They would then be assigned at random to one of the five treatments. The animals would be housed in close proximity, and possibly even in the same cage, if the different treatments can be given in such a situation. When measurements are to be made on the animals, those in Block 1 would be treated as a group, with all measurements being made within a short period by the same per- son. Animals in the other blocks would likewise be selected to be as uniform as possible, but might differ in body weight or age, etc. from those in Block 1. They could be measured at a dif- ferent time, if necessary by a different person. Thus, within each block any comparison among treatments would be made on animals which are in all possible ways as similar as possible. The unwanted variation shows up as differences between blocks. This is then removed mathe- matically in the statistical analysis.

These assignment guidelines pertain exclusively to Commercial Mobile Radio Service providers (CMRS). The IMSI Administrator directly administers only the Home Network Identity (HNI) segment of the resource. The HNI uniquely identifies the home wireless network of a FCC- licensed two-way CMRS subscriber and contains the Mobile Country Code (MCC) and the Mobile Network Code (MNC). The remaining segment of the IMSI, the Mobile Station Identification Number (MSIN), is directly administered by the wireless network licensee to which the HNI is assigned. Issue: In 1998, ITU Recommendation E.212 was modified allowing IMSI assignments to those Wireline Service Providers offering limited mobility services. As a result, HNI assignments are no longer available exclusively to CMRS providers. The current IMSI assignment and administrative guidelines do not however reflect these modifications.

The structural design of cavity walls should follow either rational or empirical methods. The rational design method is based on the properties of the wall materials and engineering analysis. This method may be used for any structure where high loads are likely or where tall walls are a necessity. The empirical method is generally satisfactory for one and two-story buildings consisting of light construction with limited floor spans and wall heights; and for multistory buildings where unsupported wall heights are not excessive.

medicine (NMM) and OMM obtain many more hundreds of hours of manual medicine training in a wider variety of clinical settings than DCs and other DOs. This section was meant to give you a better sense of what “osteopathic manipulative medicine” entails, and hopefully it answered most of your questions regarding OMM. The effectiveness of OMM remains a topic of ongoing debate and research despite past and current efforts to lay these arguments to rest. Whether an osteo- pathic physician uses OMM in his or her practice is based entirely on preference. With that said, it is an important core discipline and primary distinction of the osteopathic profession.

A patient’s decision to use an OON provider selection may be intentional or accidental. Reasons patients may incur OON costs include patient preference for a particular provider or specialty care center that may be out of network, the lack of network providers with appropriate specialists, and the lack of awareness or transparency about which providers are in the patient’s plan network. Common scenarios for accidental use of OON providers are emergency care or care from an OON provider working at an in-network hospital (e.g., radiologist, assistant surgeon, anesthesiologist).22 23 Figure 9 suggests that there might be significant financial consequences to the patient going out of network, which could be exacerbated if health plans remove popular cancer providers from their networks. Figure 9 also provides information on the relationship between the OON percentage (right vertical axis--relative to total spending) and total patient cost-sharing (left vertical axis). While most patients in our study reported under 10% of all OOP cost in the year of diagnosis is spent on out-of- network providers, those in the highest percentile of OOP spending incurred as much as 40% of those costs out-of-network.

Canada has a national stopgap to protect consumers from price gouging. The Patient Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB), a consumer protection agency, has the authority to impose sanctions and price reductions for patented products deemed excessively priced. However, the PMPRB is hobbled in its ability to keep Canada’s drug spending low.
Concrete masonry units are usually used for the interior wythe of a cavity wall in combination with a brick masonry exterior. They may also be used as accent bands in the exterior brick wythe. Hollow or solid concrete masonry units should conform to ASTM C 55 Specification for Concrete Building Brick, ASTM C 90 Specification for Loadbearing Concrete Masonry Units or ASTM C 129 Specification for Non-Loadbearing Concrete Masonry Units. Non load- bearing concrete masonry units are usually specified for the interior wythe when the brick and block cavity wall is used as infill walls for concrete or steel frame structural systems if shear loads are not transmitted to that wythe.

1. Decide when to clean. Mortar must harden prior to cleaning. It is generally best to schedule cleaning at least seven days after brickwork is completed. In some cases it may be possible to clean earlier; how- ever, effects on the masonry and influencing factors such as weather conditions and the type of brick and mortar should be carefully considered. Prolonged time periods between the completion of the masonry and cleaning should be avoided. After one month, mortar smears and splatters left on brickwork become increasingly difficult to remove. 2. Remove larger clumps of mortar using wooden paddles or nonmetallic tools. Metal tools may damage the brickwork or leave behind fragments that oxidize and cause rust stains. 3. Select the proper cleaning solution. There are many types of proprietary cleaners available that are for- mulated to remove specific stains or for use with a particular type of brick. Be careful to select cleaning products suitable for the brick, mortar and adjacent materials and follow the cleaner manufacturer’s rec- ommended instructions. Each product being considered should be evaluated as discussed previously in Trial Cleaning.

a physician intentionally stimulates a physiologic response by CO 2 inhalation [31], sodium lactate infusion [32,33], or cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4) injection [32,34]. These chemical exposures are used as potent tools to design controlled studies with predictable levels of PA episodes. In a study with healthy volunteer subjects using carbon dioxide inhalation to provoke panic and anxiety, propranolol significantly decreased heart rate, a cardiovascular somatic symptom, but did not provide psychic anxiolytic benefit [35].

While many of these symptoms can be seen with other conditions such as allergies, we ask that you seek medical evaluation if you identify any of these symptoms. Loss of taste or smell is very specific to COVID‐19 and may be described as food tasting bland, rather than not being able to taste. If your child develops any of these symptoms, please notify your child’s school, contact your child’s doctor for evaluation/testing, and keep your child home from school.

What is the purpose of a RA and what makes it a good one, and who decides that it is a good RA? Are there rules for easier writing? If the main function of a RA is to transfer a new knowledge on a research topic, then a good paper is the one that is clear, coherent, focused, well argued and uses language that does not have ambiguous or equivoque meaning. However, it is not only the message that is important. The RA must have a well-defined structure and function in serve like a cook-book, so the others can reproduce and repeat explained experiments. Answer research questions Give summary conclusions There are some rules that can make the writing and publishing of RAs 'easier'. Here, we summarised some 'golden' rules that should always be in the mind of an inexperienced researcher (Table 3). We put all these together to make a final list of some 40 logical steps, which can be find in the Appendix.

AASM practice parameter papers are based on evidence- based review and grading of literature, often addressing a spe- cific issue or topic. Clinical guidelines provide clinicians with a working overview for disease or disorder evaluation and man- agement. These guidelines include practice parameter papers and also include areas with limited evidence in order to provide a comprehensive practice guideline. Both practice parameters and clinical guidelines define principles of practice that should meet the needs of most patients. They should not, however, be considered exhaustive, inclusive of all available methods of care, or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably expected to obtain the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding appropriateness of any specific therapy must be made by the clinician and patient in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible

In addition to return to learning and sporting environments, older athletes may need to return to driving, where subtle defi- cits could compromise safety. Most sports medicine physicians do not counsel athletes with SRC about driving.90 Driving is a complex process involving coordination of cognitive, visual and motor skills, as well as concentration, attention, visual percep- tion, insight and memory, which can all be affected by SRC.90 Little is known about the risk of driving after SRC, but prelim- inary data suggest some impairment exists when patients with concussion report they are asymptomatic.91 Currently, no widely

Insomnia occurs in individuals of all ages and races, and has been observed across all cultures and countries.8,9 The actual prevalence of insomnia varies according to the stringency of the definition used. Insomnia symptoms occur in approximately 33% to 50% of the adult population; insomnia symptoms with dis- tress or impairment (i.e., general insomnia disorder) in 10% to 15%; and specific insomnia disorders in 5% to 10%.10 Consis- tent risk factors for insomnia include increasing age, female sex, comorbid (medical, psychiatric, sleep, and substance use) disor- ders, shift work, and possibly unemployment and lower socio- economic status. Patients with comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions are at particularly increased risk, with psychiatric and chronic pain disorders having insomnia rates as high as 50% to 75%.11-13 The risk relationship between insomnia and psychiatric disorders appears to be bidirectional; several studies have also

Dose ranging test: Here, compounds are tested at a minimum of 4 different doses (the “dose ranging, full 4-day test”, typically 100, 30, 10 and 3 mg/kg, by both s.c. and p.o. routes of administration). ED 50 and ED 90 values are calculated by plotting the log dose against probit activity (for example, using Microcal “Origin”). These reflect the drug concentrations at which 50% and 90% of suppression of parasitemia is achieved. Note that with short half-life drugs it may be necessary to dose multiple times per day. Two other parameters measured in this study are relative potency compared to an appropriate standard drug, and oral bioavailability (assessed by comparison of oral and parenteral administration).

The IOM report supports these findings, stating that diagnostic errors contribute to 10% of patient deaths and 6-17% of hospital adverse events. Other researchers quantify the human cost of diagnostic errors at between 40,000 and 80,000 deaths per year.9 These troubling findings make developing effective methods to prevent diagnostic errors an urgent priority.

the fact that 11 of the 12 medicines approved by the United States Food &amp; Drug Administration (US FDA) in 2012 for various cancer indications were priced above US$ 100 000 per year. The experts asserted that the prices of these medicines were too high, unsustainable, might compromise access of needy patients to highly effective therapy, and harmful to the sustainability of national health care systems (30). Similarly, in 2015, yet another group of cancer experts have petitioned for lower medicine prices (31).

Dose ranging test: Here, compounds are tested at a minimum of 4 different doses (the “dose ranging, full 4-day test”, typically 100, 30, 10 and 3 mg/kg, by both s.c. and p.o. routes of administration). ED 50 and ED 90 values are calculated by plotting the log dose against probit activity (for example, using Microcal “Origin”). These reflect the drug concentrations at which 50% and 90% of suppression of parasitemia is achieved. Note that with short half-life drugs it may be necessary to dose multiple times per day. Two other parameters measured in this study are relative potency compared to an appropriate standard drug, and oral bioavailability (assessed by comparison of oral and parenteral administration).

The naïve interpretation of this is that no more than 13 candidate compounds would be needed for a reasonable chance of launching one new medicine, and 25 for a com- bination with two NCEs (new chemical entities). How- ever, if one aims for a 90% overall chance of success (P), the number of candidates n, each with a success probabil- ity s (8%) is described by the negative binomial distribu- tion in Eq. 1.
Composite or combination flashings are typically less expensive than sheet metal and are easier to install. The most predominant type is a thin layer of metal sandwiched between one or two layers of another material. The metal layer is usually of aluminum, copper or lead. It is covered on one or both sides with various materials, such as asphalt coatings, kraft paper, fiberglass fabric or plastic films. Product literature should be reviewed to determine whether these materials are appropriate for use in brick masonry cavity walls. Consideration should be given to compatibility with adjacent sealants, delamination due to moisture penetration and movement of the wall system.

1989). In the 1990’s newer agents were developed and marketed that had selective effects on GABA receptors in- cluding Zolpidem (Ambien), Zaleplon (Sonata), Eszopi- clone (Estorra) and Indiplon. While all hypnotics have abuse potential for individuals with addictive histories and personalities, these agents have been noted to have min- imal additive potential (Hajak et al. 2003). These agents are less likely to have deleterious side effects than most OTC treatments for insomnia, however, with increased use, more side effects including next effects on driving have been reported. This effect as well as next day re- bound insomnia has particularly been reported for higher doses of zolpidem (Verster et al. 2002). In many cases, MVA’s occurred in the period of somnolence and cogni- tive impairment during the first few hours after ingestion. Comparatively normal results on psychomotor tests can be obtained 3.25 h. after zaleplon ingestion and 6.25 h. after zopiclone ingestion (Paul et al. 2003). While these agents have excellent efficacy with minimal side effects, at higher doses these agents can exhibit benzodiazepine-like effects. Idiosyncratic reactions of persistent daytime som- nolence and/or memory loss have been reported. Some patients will report next day sedation after the nighttime use of these agents, as well as demonstrate an increased error rate in driving tests (Verster et al. 2007). Such infor- mation was forthcoming only after these drugs became generic and widely utilized in clinical practice. Most sedat- ing drugs if adopted into such widespread use would also be at least as likely to demonstrate epidemiological effects on MVA’s and MVA associated deaths. In the elderly, chronic use of sedating drugs (particularly those with anti-cholinergic side effects) can be associated with an increased risk for falls, and confusion (American Geriatrics Society 2015). Reported next day sleepiness and other side effects associated with hypnotic use are summarized in Table 3. The newer GABA-effective hypnotics are the only medications with demonstrated effectiveness in treating chronic insomnia (NIH State of the Science Conference
While many of these symptoms can be seen with other conditions such as allergies, we ask that you seek medical evaluation if you identify any of these symptoms. Loss of taste or smell is very specific to COVID‐19 and may be described as food tasting bland, rather than not being able to taste. If your child develops any of these symptoms, please notify your child’s school, contact your child’s doctor for evaluation/testing, and keep your child home from school.

One can reasonably assert that this beneficial anxiolytic effect might have been enhanced even further under three study design conditions. First, if the inclusion criteria had required each patient to have a high anxiety score prior to the procedure, for instance a minimum of 7 points (with 10 as the maximum), there would have been a greater potential for a difference pre-treatment vs. during the procedure. The six responders had a baseline average of 6.3 points, so there was room for improvement. Of the six responders, two subjects had low baseline anxiety scores (i.e., patient F at 4 points and patient I at 2 points). A higher baseline inclusion parameter could have increased the differential prior to vs. during the EMG procedure. Second, there might not have been a sufficiently long waiting period between the drug administration and the procedure. One can reasonably assert that if the time interval between dosing and the procedure was increased to a minimum of 30 minutes or more (from the 10 – 20 minutes), the percentage of responders and the magnitude of the response could have been greater. However, it should be noted that often in a clinic time-is-of-the-essence between the patient’s initial assessment by the medical provider and the subsequent medical procedure. Some medical providers are willing to pre-treat an anxious patient, typically with an oral benzodiazepine either swallowed intact or pre-dissolved in water, and then have him/her wait (e.g., 30 + min.) for an anxiolytic effect to be acknowledged by the patient. But, some physicians and dentists might be under time constraints or might not be willing to oblige the patient this waiting period. This would not be an obstacle if either the drug has a rapid onset of effect or the patient were to pre-treat themselves immediately prior to arrival at the physician’s office, for instance 30-60 minutes in advance. Even under the conditions of this study that the authors consider might have been sub-optimal, this drug combo delivered by the oral mucosal route provided a rapid onset effect as a PRN medication. This anxiolytic benefit may be useful in treating anticipatory anxiety either in-office or prior to arrival. There is a third limitation to this study to consider. The compounded medicine contained 25 mg of atenolol and 0.2 mg of scopolamine HBr.

of care data [ 12 ] . The NCI estimate for expenditure on prostate cancer treatment in 2006 was $9.862 billion, and average Medicare payments per patient in the fi rst year after diagnosis were $11 000. It should be noted when interpreting this data that use of PSA testing for prostate cancer is more widespread in the USA than in many other countries, thus increasing the number of cases identifi ed. In addition, Medicare did not cover certain cancer care expenses such as oral medicines, commonly used to treat prostate cancer until January 2006. These out-of-pocket costs may comprise 10% of the $11 000 estimate. Direct medical expenditures are only one part of the total economic burden of cancer, as cancer- related illnesses and death lead to losses in economic productivity.

Of note, mice under single or combined metformin treatments showed an extended survival, whereas 84% of the nontreat- ed mice succumbed within 1 week after infection (Table 1). In conclusion, metformin treatment in combi- nation with suboptimal dosage of conventional antimalarials is more efficacious in reducing parasite load.

receptor antagonist that affects the autonomic nervous system and reduces cardiovascular symptoms (e.g., tachycardia and hypertension) resulting from epinephrine in the circulation. Beta blockers interfere with receptor binding by catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine, of which epinephrine is the principal catecholamine affecting the cardiovascular symptoms. Propranolol is a lipophilic beta blocker that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, it can affect both somatic and CNS target tissues.

In cav- ity walls and veneers, the temperature at the center of each wythe or component should be used. In dis- continuous construction, the wythes will have different temperatures due to the separation of the wythes by an air space and perhaps insulation.

Readership analysis was conducted on the 20 science journals in our data set (n(cid:1)2903). Articles published in the social sciences and humanities journals (n(cid:1)350) were omitted from the readership analysis, as many did not include abstract or full-text versions of their articles, and, in some cases, refer- ence views were added to full-text views, resulting in indeter- minate and incomparable results. Citation analyses were conducted on the entire article data set (n(cid:1)3245). A logistic regression model was used to estimate the likelihood of articles in each experimental group being cited within the first year after publication, controlling for journal and journal category effects.

Insomnia occurs in individuals of all ages and races, and has been observed across all cultures and countries.8,9 The actual prevalence of insomnia varies according to the stringency of the definition used. Insomnia symptoms occur in approximately 33% to 50% of the adult population; insomnia symptoms with dis- tress or impairment (i.e., general insomnia disorder) in 10% to 15%; and specific insomnia disorders in 5% to 10%.10 Consis- tent risk factors for insomnia include increasing age, female sex, comorbid (medical, psychiatric, sleep, and substance use) disor- ders, shift work, and possibly unemployment and lower socio- economic status. Patients with comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions are at particularly increased risk, with psychiatric and chronic pain disorders having insomnia rates as high as 50% to 75%.11-13 The risk relationship between insomnia and psychiatric disorders appears to be bidirectional; several studies have also

The strength and moisture penetration resistance of a brick masonry cavity wall are affected by the mortar selection and compatibility with the brick units. Portland cement-lime, mortar cement, or masonry cement mortars can be used. However, mortars with an air content less than 12 percent are recommended for their superior bond strength and resistance to moisture penetration. The MSJC Code requires that the allowable flexural tensile stresses be reduced by approximately 50 percent for assemblies constructed with masonry cement mortars or portland cement-lime mortars that have air entrainment. In addition, some building codes prohibit the use of masonry cement mortars and all Type N mortars in Seismic Performance Categories D and E (formerly Seismic Zones 3 and 4). Mortar should meet the proportion requirements of ASTM C 270 Specification for Mortar for Unit Masonry as shown in Table 1. Mortar type selection should be based on project requirements, such as strength and compatibility with a particular brick unit. Types N or S mortars are typically used in brick masonry cavity walls. See Technical Notes 8 Series for more detailed information on mortar types and selection.

samples)) / (geometric mean cpm of no drug samples). Percentage reductions are used to plot percentage inhibition of growth as a function of drug concentrations. IC 50 values are determined by linear regression analyses on the linear segments of the curves (IC 90 values can also be determined by curve-fitting and can provide an useful measure of variation between experiments). Assays are typically repeated on two or three separate occasions. Within each experiment, standard deviations are typically less than 10% of the mean. Differences in parasite stages of development can lead to up to two-fold shifts in the IC 50 values between experiments; however, these differences rarely affect the overall relationships between the parasite lines in terms of their differences in drug response 4-11 .

receptor antagonist that affects the autonomic nervous system and reduces cardiovascular symptoms (e.g., tachycardia and hypertension) resulting from epinephrine in the circulation. Beta blockers interfere with receptor binding by catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine, of which epinephrine is the principal catecholamine affecting the cardiovascular symptoms. Propranolol is a lipophilic beta blocker that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, it can affect both somatic and CNS target tissues.

Recent analyses of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)- Medicare database tracked healthcare use and costs (projected to 2004 levels) from diagnosis and initial treatment [ 15 ] , in addition to a 4-year follow-up [ 17 ] , for a cohort of 81 659 elderly patients with prostate cancer who had Medicare claims from 1991 to 2003 [ 15 ] , and 1991 to 2004 [ 17 ] , respectively. Treatment in the fi rst year after diagnosis was calculated to incur costs of $21 040 per patient; $13 091 for prostate cancer-related costs and $7949 for medical costs unrelated to prostate cancer [ 15 ] . In terms of cost at each stage, as expected, there was an increase in costs from stage I to IV [ 15,17 ] . Prostate cancer-related costs over 4 years from diagnosis averaged $18 168 per patient [ 17 ] . The annual healthcare cost burden estimated in 2009 is &gt; $2.5 billion annually for initial care alone [ 17 ] .

Some countries may place limits on the frequency and magnitude of price increments, or even impose a price freeze or price reduction (161,184). In the latter, pharmaceutical prices cannot be raised for a predetermined period of time unless there is a justification. For example, since August 2010 (and at least until 2022), Germany has implemented a moratorium to halt price increase for medicines that are not subject to reference pricing, except for inflation (185).
Composite or combination flashings are typically less expensive than sheet metal and are easier to install. The most predominant type is a thin layer of metal sandwiched between one or two layers of another material. The metal layer is usually of aluminum, copper or lead. It is covered on one or both sides with various materials, such as asphalt coatings, kraft paper, fiberglass fabric or plastic films. Product literature should be reviewed to determine whether these materials are appropriate for use in brick masonry cavity walls. Consideration should be given to compatibility with adjacent sealants, delamination due to moisture penetration and movement of the wall system.

The analysis found that low-income countries could spend on average up to US$ 3800 per cancer patient annually on cancer medicines for all newly-diagnosed cancer patients, and the total expenditure on these medicines would be within the generously assumed 5% of the total health expenditure (Table 4.2). In high- income countries, the analysis found that a budget threshold of 5% of the total health expenditure would allow a spending of up to US$ 40 600 on cancer medicines per patient per year, with a view to providing universal coverage.

The structural design of cavity walls should follow either rational or empirical methods. The rational design method is based on the properties of the wall materials and engineering analysis. This method may be used for any structure where high loads are likely or where tall walls are a necessity. The empirical method is generally satisfactory for one and two-story buildings consisting of light construction with limited floor spans and wall heights; and for multistory buildings where unsupported wall heights are not excessive.

Phase 1. The aim of Phase 1 was to identify the contributions of clinical and laboratory variables that in practice were the most predictive of the decision to initiate DMARD therapy in a population of patients with early undifferentiated synovitis. Initiation of DMARD therapy was used as an indicator of the physician’s opinion that the patient was at risk of developing persistent and/or erosive arthritis that we would currently consider to be RA. Data on 3,115 patients from 9 early arthritis cohorts who were consid- ered not to have evidence of another possible diagnosis explaining their presentation were obtained. Between July 2007 and November 2008 an expert working group developed an analysis strategy that related an agreed- upon list of standardized clinical and laboratory vari- ables collected at baseline to the initiation of DMARD treatment within the next 12 months. MTX initiation was used as the gold standard for this purpose. The analytical process aimed to identify the independent contribution of each variable on this list and included univariate regression modeling, a subsequent principal components analysis, and a multivariate regression model that included all identified components (25). The resulting list of informative variables identified during that process and the weights based on the odds ratios are shown in Table 1. Phase 2. Phase 2 consisted of a consensus-based, decision science–informed approach, which took place between November 2008 and June 2009. The purpose of this phase was to derive a clinician-based judgment on

a) The regulation gives data subjects the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, where there is a legal or similarly significant effect on the person (the regulation prohibits automated processing where there is no meaningful human involvement in the decision and where the decision either impacts one’s legal rights, or the decision has the potential to significantly influence the circumstances, behavior, or choices of the individuals concerned). b) Other considerations: i) Research affecting the healthcare a person receives, where there is no human involvement in the decision, would be considered covered under the regulation (i.e., assigning trial subjects to receive an intervention or placebo, based solely on the individual’s personal data, i.e., test results)

Properties of insulation materials vary widely. Table 3 shows various properties of insulation materials used in brick masonry cavity walls. The thermal conductivity (k) and thermal resistance (R) provide a means of comparing the insulating properties of insulation materials. These are determined in accordance with ASTM C 177 Test Method for Steady-State Heat Flux Measurements and Thermal Transmission Properties by Means of the Guarded-Hot-Plate Apparatus measured at various temperatures. Due to the large number of types of insulation, and even larger number of manufacturers, Table 3 lists only a few representative values of physical properties. For some materials, an aged or stabilized value is given. In all cases, the aged or stabilized value is the one that should be used in design. Individual manufacturers should be consulted for design values and other properties of their specific materials and their applications.

Some countries may place limits on the frequency and magnitude of price increments, or even impose a price freeze or price reduction (161,184). In the latter, pharmaceutical prices cannot be raised for a predetermined period of time unless there is a justification. For example, since August 2010 (and at least until 2022), Germany has implemented a moratorium to halt price increase for medicines that are not subject to reference pricing, except for inflation (185).

receptor antagonist that affects the autonomic nervous system and reduces cardiovascular symptoms (e.g., tachycardia and hypertension) resulting from epinephrine in the circulation. Beta blockers interfere with receptor binding by catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine, of which epinephrine is the principal catecholamine affecting the cardiovascular symptoms. Propranolol is a lipophilic beta blocker that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, it can affect both somatic and CNS target tissues.

Building on Failures Researchers continue on their search for effective new treatments for the more than 120 forms of brain cancer, but they face great challenges.93 Since 1998, there have only been 3 new drug approvals for brain cancer, while another 75 medicines have failed in the development process having been discontinued, suspended, or had no development reported.94 That is a 25:1 ratio of unsuccessful attempts to FDA-approved medicines. Decades of research have provided limited treatment options for patients facing aggressive, late-stage forms of brain cancer. Although challenges persist, researchers continue to use past setbacks to inform future discoveries in brain cancer therapies.

Participants agreed that some RA, even with good data and interesting results, will be rejected if the style and format of the paper are not tailored for the audience. This agrees with the results of investigations among 116 editors (Gosden, 1992; Fig. 1), who identified following most frequent causes to reject an L2 author: unclear text, incoherent development of the topic in paragraphs and incorrect use of grammar. In addition, the participants analysed an exemplary flawed paper by unknown author and decided to reject it after some discussion. The list of reasons for rejection can be seen in Table 1.

The increase in full-text downloads for open access articles during their first year after publication suggests that the primary benefit to the nonsubscriber commu- nity is in browsing, as opposed to printing or saving, which would have been indicated by a commensurate increase in PDF downloads. The decrease in abstract views suggests a reader preference for the full docu- ment when available.

We used an expert provided list of 42 relevant domain terms for the Myocardial Perfusion Imaging domain (a sub-domain of nuclear cardiology) to heuristically test the coverage of our ontology terms. Of these, we found 31 exactly matching terms, 2 morphological variants and 8 phrases that contained the terms from the expert list. Out of this 42 domain terms, 1 term, ‘dyperidamole’, was not found in our ontology (dyperidamole is a drug given during pregnancy). We found that this term didn’t exist in the 618 JNC abstracts we were using. Instead, another term, diperidamole (spelling variant) existed in our term list. To do away with noise in our data, we selected terms with greater than average frequency (2.9) of the 10191 retrieved terms and set that as our threshold. We pruned the list to

The use of two antimalarials simultaneously, especially when the antimalarials have different mechanisms of action, has the potential for inhib- iting the development of resistance to either of the components. The efficacy of a combination of a 4-aminoquinoline drug (either chloroquine or amo- diaquine) with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine has been reviewed (43). The results of this review sug- gested that the addition of either chloroquine or amodiaquine to SP marginally improved parasitological clearance (compared with SP alone). The studies reviewed were mostly done in areas and at times when both SP and chloroquine/amodi- aquine retained a fair amount of efficacy, and it is not clear from these studies how well such a combination would act in areas where one of the components was significantly compromised. Additionally, to date, there are no data to suggest whether this slightly improved clearance would

Parasitemia is determined microscopically by counting 4 fields of approximately 100 erythrocytes per field. For low parasitemias (&lt;1%), up to 4000 erythrocytes have to be counted. Alternatively the parasitemia can also be determined by FACS analysis, which works particularly well for parasitemias &gt;1%.

Of note, mice under single or combined metformin treatments showed an extended survival, whereas 84% of the nontreat- ed mice succumbed within 1 week after infection (Table 1). In conclusion, metformin treatment in combi- nation with suboptimal dosage of conventional antimalarials is more efficacious in reducing parasite load.

If you are declining enrollment for yourself or your dependents (including your spouse) because of other health insurance coverage, you may in the future be able to enroll yourself or your dependents in this health plan, provided that you request enrollment within 30 days after your other coverage ends. In addition, if you have a new dependent as a result of marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, you may be able to enroll yourself and your dependents, provided that you request enrollment within 30 days after the marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption.

veys, and frequent teleconference discussions, the expert panel identified consensus areas and recommendations for those areas not covered by AASM practice parameters. Recommendations were generated by panel members and discussed by all. To min- imize individual expert bias, the group anonymously voted and rated consensus recommendations from 1: strongly disagree to 9: strongly agree. Consensus was defined when all experts rated a recommendation 8 or 9. If consensus was not evident after the first vote, the consensus recommendations were discussed again, amended as appropriate, and a second anonymous vote was conducted. If consensus was not evident after the second vote, the process was repeated until consensus was attained to include or exclude a recommendation.

A patient’s decision to use an OON provider selection may be intentional or accidental. Reasons patients may incur OON costs include patient preference for a particular provider or specialty care center that may be out of network, the lack of network providers with appropriate specialists, and the lack of awareness or transparency about which providers are in the patient’s plan network. Common scenarios for accidental use of OON providers are emergency care or care from an OON provider working at an in-network hospital (e.g., radiologist, assistant surgeon, anesthesiologist).22 23 Figure 9 suggests that there might be significant financial consequences to the patient going out of network, which could be exacerbated if health plans remove popular cancer providers from their networks. Figure 9 also provides information on the relationship between the OON percentage (right vertical axis--relative to total spending) and total patient cost-sharing (left vertical axis). While most patients in our study reported under 10% of all OOP cost in the year of diagnosis is spent on out-of- network providers, those in the highest percentile of OOP spending incurred as much as 40% of those costs out-of-network.

AASM practice parameter papers are based on evidence- based review and grading of literature, often addressing a spe- cific issue or topic. Clinical guidelines provide clinicians with a working overview for disease or disorder evaluation and man- agement. These guidelines include practice parameter papers and also include areas with limited evidence in order to provide a comprehensive practice guideline. Both practice parameters and clinical guidelines define principles of practice that should meet the needs of most patients. They should not, however, be considered exhaustive, inclusive of all available methods of care, or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably expected to obtain the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding appropriateness of any specific therapy must be made by the clinician and patient in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible

Participants agreed that some RA, even with good data and interesting results, will be rejected if the style and format of the paper are not tailored for the audience. This agrees with the results of investigations among 116 editors (Gosden, 1992; Fig. 1), who identified following most frequent causes to reject an L2 author: unclear text, incoherent development of the topic in paragraphs and incorrect use of grammar. In addition, the participants analysed an exemplary flawed paper by unknown author and decided to reject it after some discussion. The list of reasons for rejection can be seen in Table 1.

Antimalarial efficacy screening: in vitro and in vivo protocols. Supplemental file. animals are prepared and stained with Giemsa. Parasitemia is determined microscopically by counting 4 fields of approximately 100 erythrocytes per field. For low parasitemias (&lt;1%), up to 4000 erythrocytes have to be counted. Alternatively the parasitemia can also be determined by FACS analysis, which works particularly well for parasitemias &gt;1%. The difference between the mean value of the control group (taken as 100%) and those of the experimental groups is calculated and expressed as percent reduction (= activity) using the following equation:

Sport-specific rules may not allow adequate time for evaluation, and modifying these rules remains an area for improvement within the governing bodies of some sports. (C) When the sports medicine clinician becomes aware of a poten- tial injury, the athlete is approached and a brief history of the event is obtained from the athlete and those who witnessed the event or athlete behaviour. How the athlete responds to the elements of orientation, memory, concentration and balance is evaluated, as well as speech patterns and how the athlete appears to be processing information. Cervical palpation and range of motion (ROM) are also typically performed to assess for other

Incidence numbers (column 2 = total, columns 3-7 = stages 0-IV, column 8 = stage unknown or “?”, for each row columns 3 through 8 add up to column 2), incidence rates in % for stages 0-IV and stage unknown (columns 9-13 = stages 0-IV, column 14 = stage unknown, for each row columns 9 through 14 add up to 100% up to rounding to 2 digits), and incidence rates for stages I-IV only with stage 0 and stage unknown specifically excluded (columns 15-18 = stages I-IV, for each row columns 15 through 18 add up to 100% up to rounding to 2 digits). The incidence numbers are based on the data for California adults aged 20 and older diagnosed with the cancers listed in column 1 during 2005-2009 as reported in [Morris et al, 2013]. Some cancer sites in column 1 are abbreviated as follows: Breast = female breast, Cervix = cervix uteri, Rectum = rectum and rectosigmoid junction, Kidney = kidney and renal pelvis, liver = liver and intrahepatic bile ducts, Lung = lung and bronchus, Melanoma = melanoma of the skin, Oral = oral cavity and pharynx, Bladder = urinary bladder, Uterine = uterine corpus. For Bladder, stage I includes stage 0 (stage I = stage 0/I).

the fact that 11 of the 12 medicines approved by the United States Food &amp; Drug Administration (US FDA) in 2012 for various cancer indications were priced above US$ 100 000 per year. The experts asserted that the prices of these medicines were too high, unsustainable, might compromise access of needy patients to highly effective therapy, and harmful to the sustainability of national health care systems (30). Similarly, in 2015, yet another group of cancer experts have petitioned for lower medicine prices (31).
Return-to-sport progressions should be individualised based on the injury, athlete’s age, history and level of play, and the ability to provide close supervision during the return to activity, and progressions may vary between athletes. Each stage is generally 24 hours without return of concussion symptoms. Consider written clearance from a healthcare professional before return to sport as directed by local laws and regulations.3

The statewide assessments in mathematics, reading, and science are used to measure whether students, and their school and district, are meeting the academic standards. Statewide assessments are one measure of how well students are doing on the content that is part of their daily instruction. It is also a measure of how well schools and districts are doing in aligning their curriculum and teaching the standards.
Based on the size of the flue selected, a preliminary damper size must be assumed. At this point in the design process, it is only necessary to decide if the damper throat area to be used will be equal to or twice the flue area. Once this decision has been made the Inlet Loss Coefficient, K 2, may be determined. If the damper throat area is equal to the flue area, K 2 is equal to 2.5. If the damper throat is twice the flue area, K 2 is equal to 1.0.

Some countries may place limits on the frequency and magnitude of price increments, or even impose a price freeze or price reduction (161,184). In the latter, pharmaceutical prices cannot be raised for a predetermined period of time unless there is a justification. For example, since August 2010 (and at least until 2022), Germany has implemented a moratorium to halt price increase for medicines that are not subject to reference pricing, except for inflation (185).

changes in clinical status. Reassessments might be per- formed less frequently for patients with more stable pain (eg, patients who have exhibited good pain con- trol without side effects after 24 hours of stable ther- apy). Pain reassessments might be useful at the time of nursing shift changes or with new caregivers to establish a baseline and promote continuity of care, although evidence showing that routine reassessment of pain at nursing shift changes is associated with improved clinical outcomes is not available.

The key idea is that you should read the paper in up to three passes, instead of starting at the beginning and plow- ing your way to the end. Each pass accomplishes specific goals and builds upon the previous pass: The first pass gives you a general idea about the paper. The second pass lets you grasp the paper’s content, but not its details. The third pass helps you understand the paper in depth.

6. Identify the efflorescence. Knowing the composition of efflorescing salts is sometimes of use. Table 1, taken from Brownell’s report lists the most probable sources of efflorescing salts. Commercial testing laboratories can use X-ray diffraction, petrographic analysis or chemical analysis can, in some instances, determine both the type of salts present and their relative quantity. 7. Consider miscellaneous sources of water when all obvious sources have been eliminated. Some of these sources are: condensation within the wall, poorly directed landscape sprinklers, leaky pipes, faulty drains and condensation on heating or plumbing pipes. If necessary, condensation analysis methods are described in Technical Note 47.

veys, and frequent teleconference discussions, the expert panel identified consensus areas and recommendations for those areas not covered by AASM practice parameters. Recommendations were generated by panel members and discussed by all. To min- imize individual expert bias, the group anonymously voted and rated consensus recommendations from 1: strongly disagree to 9: strongly agree. Consensus was defined when all experts rated a recommendation 8 or 9. If consensus was not evident after the first vote, the consensus recommendations were discussed again, amended as appropriate, and a second anonymous vote was conducted. If consensus was not evident after the second vote, the process was repeated until consensus was attained to include or exclude a recommendation.

Dose ranging test: Here, compounds are tested at a minimum of 4 different doses (the “dose ranging, full 4-day test”, typically 100, 30, 10 and 3 mg/kg, by both s.c. and p.o. routes of administration). ED 50 and ED 90 values are calculated by plotting the log dose against probit activity (for example, using Microcal “Origin”). These reflect the drug concentrations at which 50% and 90% of suppression of parasitemia is achieved. Note that with short half-life drugs it may be necessary to dose multiple times per day. Two other parameters measured in this study are relative potency compared to an appropriate standard drug, and oral bioavailability (assessed by comparison of oral and parenteral administration).

Building on Failures Researchers continue on their search for effective new treatments for the more than 120 forms of brain cancer, but they face great challenges.93 Since 1998, there have only been 3 new drug approvals for brain cancer, while another 75 medicines have failed in the development process having been discontinued, suspended, or had no development reported.94 That is a 25:1 ratio of unsuccessful attempts to FDA-approved medicines. Decades of research have provided limited treatment options for patients facing aggressive, late-stage forms of brain cancer. Although challenges persist, researchers continue to use past setbacks to inform future discoveries in brain cancer therapies.

The naïve interpretation of this is that no more than 13 candidate compounds would be needed for a reasonable chance of launching one new medicine, and 25 for a com- bination with two NCEs (new chemical entities). How- ever, if one aims for a 90% overall chance of success (P), the number of candidates n, each with a success probabil- ity s (8%) is described by the negative binomial distribu- tion in Eq. 1.

Reassessments might be per- formed less frequently for patients with more stable pain (eg, patients who have exhibited good pain con- trol without side effects after 24 hours of stable ther- apy). Pain reassessments might be useful at the time of nursing shift changes or with new caregivers to establish a baseline and promote continuity of care, although evidence showing that routine reassessment of pain at nursing shift changes is associated with improved clinical outcomes is not available.

Sport-specific rules may not allow adequate time for evaluation, and modifying these rules remains an area for improvement within the governing bodies of some sports. (C) When the sports medicine clinician becomes aware of a poten- tial injury, the athlete is approached and a brief history of the event is obtained from the athlete and those who witnessed the event or athlete behaviour. How the athlete responds to the elements of orientation, memory, concentration and balance is evaluated, as well as speech patterns and how the athlete appears to be processing information.

The use of two antimalarials simultaneously, especially when the antimalarials have different mechanisms of action, has the potential for inhib- iting the development of resistance to either of the components. The efficacy of a combination of a 4-aminoquinoline drug (either chloroquine or amo- diaquine) with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine has been reviewed (43). The results of this review sug- gested that the addition of either chloroquine or amodiaquine to SP marginally improved parasitological clearance (compared with SP alone). The studies reviewed were mostly done in areas and at times when both SP and chloroquine/amodi- aquine retained a fair amount of efficacy, and it is not clear from these studies how well such a combination would act in areas where one of the components was significantly compromised. Additionally, to date, there are no data to suggest whether this slightly improved clearance would

receptor antagonist that affects the autonomic nervous system and reduces cardiovascular symptoms (e.g., tachycardia and hypertension) resulting from epinephrine in the circulation. Beta blockers interfere with receptor binding by catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine, of which epinephrine is the principal catecholamine affecting the cardiovascular symptoms. Propranolol is a lipophilic beta blocker that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, it can affect both somatic and CNS target tissues.

For example, diet modifications –e.g. diets rich in fruit and vegetables and low in fats- will be coded under “Dietary patterns” and combinations of micronutrients in supplements will be coded under “Dietary Constituents”.
The IOM report supports these findings, stating that diagnostic errors contribute to 10% of patient deaths and 6-17% of hospital adverse events. Other researchers quantify the human cost of diagnostic errors at between 40,000 and 80,000 deaths per year.9 These troubling findings make developing effective methods to prevent diagnostic errors an urgent priority.

a physician intentionally stimulates a physiologic response by CO 2 inhalation [31], sodium lactate infusion [32,33], or cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4) injection [32,34]. These chemical exposures are used as potent tools to design controlled studies with predictable levels of PA episodes. In a study with healthy volunteer subjects using carbon dioxide inhalation to provoke panic and anxiety, propranolol significantly decreased heart rate, a cardiovascular somatic symptom, but did not provide psychic anxiolytic benefit [35].

Recent analyses of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)- Medicare database tracked healthcare use and costs (projected to 2004 levels) from diagnosis and initial treatment [ 15 ] , in addition to a 4-year follow-up [ 17 ] , for a cohort of 81 659 elderly patients with prostate cancer who had Medicare claims from 1991 to 2003 [ 15 ] , and 1991 to 2004 [ 17 ] , respectively. Treatment in the fi rst year after diagnosis was calculated to incur costs of $21 040 per patient; $13 091 for prostate cancer-related costs and $7949 for medical costs unrelated to prostate cancer [ 15 ] . In terms of cost at each stage, as expected, there was an increase in costs from stage I to IV [ 15,17 ] . Prostate cancer-related costs over 4 years from diagnosis averaged $18 168 per patient [ 17 ] . The annual healthcare cost burden estimated in 2009 is &gt; $2.5 billion annually for initial care alone [ 17 ] .

We report the results for four experiments in this pa- per: i) the results of using the IDF stoplist over a ba- sic stoplist, ii) the results of our approach using dif- ferent context descriptions of the possible concepts of a target word, iii) the results of our approach com- pared to SenseClusters and Humphrey et al. (2006) using the NLM-WSD dataset, and iv) the results of our approach compared to SenseClusters using the con(cid:3)ated dataset. The results of using an individualized IDF stoplist for each target word show an improvement over us- ing the basic stoplist. The results of our approach using different context descriptions show that for the NLM-WSD dataset the large differences in accuracy makes it unclear which of the context descriptions performed the best. On the con(cid:3)ated dataset, adding the ST de(cid:2)nition to the context description improved

medicine when following up n candidate molecules. The numerical solutions for this equation show that at least 48 molecules are to be evaluated for this probability to exceed 90%. The MMV discovery portfolio was built and funded to deliver two new preclinical candidates per year, and allowing for a third molecule coming from else- where, then this would still require some 16 years’ invest- ment per combination, except if there is a considerable increase in success rates going forwards (and a justifica- tion for this), or significantly increased investment. The hope on the horizon is that many of the new molecules are first-in-class, and so should they fail in clinical devel- opment there will be scope for well-defined back-up pro- jects, and these are normally much more cost-effective programmes. The definition of new molecular targets also opens up new possibilities for engaging the wider research community, allowing access to resources such as the EU’s European Lead Factory, which considers molec- ular targets but not phenotypic approaches.
The IOM report supports these findings, stating that diagnostic errors contribute to 10% of patient deaths and 6-17% of hospital adverse events. Other researchers quantify the human cost of diagnostic errors at between 40,000 and 80,000 deaths per year.9 These troubling findings make developing effective methods to prevent diagnostic errors an urgent priority.

Comments
6. Evaluating – can include commenting on the degrees of success and failure of something, or the value of something The ability to analyze and creatively adapt to new situations is at the heart of critical thinking. Paul and Elder (2008, 2014b) asserted that critical thinking provides a vehicle for educating the mind. John Dewey would agree, as from his early work, we have increased our sense of the pragmatic basis of human thought (its instrumental nature), and especially its grounding in actual human purposes, goals, and objectives. Dewey (1910) also discussed critical thinking in terms of reflective thinking, which is an uneasiness in accepting the status quo and that critical thinking is both an emotional and intellectual component. Students must, therefore, be taught to examine, poke, question, and reflect on what they have learned. Scepticism, questioning, and reflection is essential. Dewey also stated that schools should have an intimate relationship with the community it serves. From the review of the research concerning critical thinking and what components are considered important in high school education and later a life-long learning skill, the authors developed a 5-step, critical thinking teaching process as outlined in Table 2. Input from the study’s nine experts who reviewed the model and from suggestions from other model developers, led to the selection of easy to remember letters that describe each step’s process.

Incidence numbers (column 2 = total, columns 3-7 = stages 0-IV, column 8 = stage unknown or “?”, for each row columns 3 through 8 add up to column 2), incidence rates in % for stages 0-IV and stage unknown (columns 9-13 = stages 0-IV, column 14 = stage unknown, for each row columns 9 through 14 add up to 100% up to rounding to 2 digits), and incidence rates for stages I-IV only with stage 0 and stage unknown specifically excluded (columns 15-18 = stages I-IV, for each row columns 15 through 18 add up to 100% up to rounding to 2 digits). The incidence numbers are based on the data for California adults aged 20 and older diagnosed with the cancers listed in column 1 during 2005-2009 as reported in [Morris et al, 2013]. Some cancer sites in column 1 are abbreviated as follows: Breast = female breast, Cervix = cervix uteri, Rectum = rectum and rectosigmoid junction, Kidney = kidney and renal pelvis, liver = liver and intrahepatic bile ducts, Lung = lung and bronchus, Melanoma = melanoma of the skin, Oral = oral cavity and pharynx, Bladder = urinary bladder, Uterine = uterine corpus. For Bladder, stage I includes stage 0 (stage I = stage 0/I).
somnolence as a side effect is reproducible in susceptible individuals (White and Rumbold 1988). Sedation is a com- mon side effect of the traditional antipsychotics, with chlorpromazine and thioridazine somewhat more sedating than haloperidol. Clinical studies have shown a high inci- dence of persistent sedation with clozapine (46%) with less frequent reports of sedation with risperidone, olanzapine, sertindole and quetiapine (Monti et al. 2016). The sed- ation associated with these agents is most likely associated with their known effects on histaminic receptors. Doxepin, a sedating psychotropic agent with pro- nounced histamine (H-1) receptor antagonism exerts at least part of its effects by antagonizing orexin (Krystal et al. 2013). Suvorexant, is an orexin antagonist designed to lower waking arousal (Norman and Anderson 2016). Currently, it is being heavily marketed as a hypnotic (Rhyne and Anderson 2015). As based on performance and driving tests, this agent is known to produce a dose-related next day increase in somnolence for all age groupings tested (Farkus 2013). Sedative drug effects on daytime sleepiness are summarized in Table 4.

Insomnia occurs in individuals of all ages and races, and has been observed across all cultures and countries.8,9 The actual prevalence of insomnia varies according to the stringency of the definition used. Insomnia symptoms occur in approximately 33% to 50% of the adult population; insomnia symptoms with dis- tress or impairment (i.e., general insomnia disorder) in 10% to 15%; and specific insomnia disorders in 5% to 10%.10 Consis- tent risk factors for insomnia include increasing age, female sex, comorbid (medical, psychiatric, sleep, and substance use) disor- ders, shift work, and possibly unemployment and lower socio- economic status. Patients with comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions are at particularly increased risk, with psychiatric and chronic pain disorders having insomnia rates as high as 50% to 75%.11-13 The risk relationship between insomnia and psychiatric disorders appears to be bidirectional; several studies have also

a physician intentionally stimulates a physiologic response by CO 2 inhalation [31], sodium lactate infusion [32,33], or cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4) injection [32,34]. These chemical exposures are used as potent tools to design controlled studies with predictable levels of PA episodes. In a study with healthy volunteer subjects using carbon dioxide inhalation to provoke panic and anxiety, propranolol significantly decreased heart rate, a cardiovascular somatic symptom, but did not provide psychic anxiolytic benefit [35].

With some variation over time and across cancer types, care for the cancer population involves the six categories of services analyzed. The bars in Figures 2a-2c indicate that some patients had significant use of facility services in the year preceding the cancer diagnosis. For both colorectal and lung cancers, total spending on hospital inpatient increased as a percentage of total immediately following diagnosis. In all three cancers, the chemotherapy share of total spending increased rapidly in the first few months after diagnosis and, with the exception of breast cancer, continued at a fairly consistent level of around 20% of spending in subsequent years. Radiation therapy represented a small share of total spending except for breast cancer patients in the year following diagnosis.

These assignment guidelines pertain exclusively to Commercial Mobile Radio Service providers (CMRS). The IMSI Administrator directly administers only the Home Network Identity (HNI) segment of the resource. The HNI uniquely identifies the home wireless network of a FCC- licensed two-way CMRS subscriber and contains the Mobile Country Code (MCC) and the Mobile Network Code (MNC). The remaining segment of the IMSI, the Mobile Station Identification Number (MSIN), is directly administered by the wireless network licensee to which the HNI is assigned. Issue: In 1998, ITU Recommendation E.212 was modified allowing IMSI assignments to those Wireline Service Providers offering limited mobility services. As a result, HNI assignments are no longer available exclusively to CMRS providers. The current IMSI assignment and administrative guidelines do not however reflect these modifications.

The numbers in each block are codes for the treatment given to each animal. The purpose of such a design is to reduce heterogeneity associated with time, space and some physical varia- tion. The five animals in Block 1 would be chosen to be as similar as possible with respect to age, weight, genotype and any other variable which might influence the outcome. They would then be assigned at random to one of the five treatments. The animals would be housed in close proximity, and possibly even in the same cage, if the different treatments can be given in such a situation. When measurements are to be made on the animals, those in Block 1 would be treated as a group, with all measurements being made within a short period by the same per- son. Animals in the other blocks would likewise be selected to be as uniform as possible, but might differ in body weight or age, etc. from those in Block 1. They could be measured at a dif- ferent time, if necessary by a different person. Thus, within each block any comparison among treatments would be made on animals which are in all possible ways as similar as possible. The unwanted variation shows up as differences between blocks. This is then removed mathe- matically in the statistical analysis.

istic option. Clinical diagnosis offers the advantages of ease, speed, and low cost. In areas where malaria is prevalent, clinical diagnosis usually results in all patients with fever and no apparent other cause being treated for malaria. This approach can iden- tify most patients who truly need antimalarial treat- ment, but it is also likely to misclassify many who do not (15). Over-diagnosis can be considerable and contributes to misuse of antimalarial drugs. Considerable overlap exists between the signs and

Although, it was assumed that the 'thicker' articles with wider range of vocabulary is preferable in the editors hands, the editors (and probably the readers) prefer simple, clear and coherent writing, rather than a fancy or complex, pseudo-scientific style. Also Funkhouser and Maccoby (1971) showed that the information gain is especially enhanced by the “use of examples", i.e. it helps a lot to use some non-science material, such as everyday life parallels, historical points, etc. On the other hand, some sections, such as Introduction and Discussion, have to intrigue readers and attract interest and should therefore not be over-simplified. For example, a mysterious title can catch readers' attention and will be easily remembered (e.g.: T.Y. Li and J. Yorke named their famous paper on chaos: "The period three means chaos"). Some sections require more skill and are more important. It is approximated that from all published journal RAs in the world, only less than 5% are read in detail. However, more than 50% of abstracts are read and so the quality of an abstracts is much more important (Gordon, 1983). Therefore, the abstract should present the 'story' of the RA in miniature and should be readable standalone.

The goals of treatment are to “cure” the cancer, if possible; pro- long survival; and provide the highest possible quality of life during and after treatment. A cancer is cured when all traces of the cancer have been removed from the patient’s body. Although it is usually not possible to know if the cancer is completely eradicated, for many patients, the initial course of therapy is successful and the cancer never returns. However, some cancer- free survivors must cope with the long-term effects of treatment, as well as psychological concerns such as fear of recurrence. Cancer patients, caregivers, and survivors must have the infor- mation and support they need to play an active role in decisions that affect treatment and quality of life.

Recent analyses of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)- Medicare database tracked healthcare use and costs (projected to 2004 levels) from diagnosis and initial treatment [ 15 ] , in addition to a 4-year follow-up [ 17 ] , for a cohort of 81 659 elderly patients with prostate cancer who had Medicare claims from 1991 to 2003 [ 15 ] , and 1991 to 2004 [ 17 ] , respectively. Treatment in the fi rst year after diagnosis was calculated to incur costs of $21 040 per patient; $13 091 for prostate cancer-related costs and $7949 for medical costs unrelated to prostate cancer [ 15 ] . In terms of cost at each stage, as expected, there was an increase in costs from stage I to IV [ 15,17 ] . Prostate cancer-related costs over 4 years from diagnosis averaged $18 168 per patient [ 17 ] . The annual healthcare cost burden estimated in 2009 is &gt; $2.5 billion annually for initial care alone [ 17 ] .

Phase 1. The aim of Phase 1 was to identify the contributions of clinical and laboratory variables that in practice were the most predictive of the decision to initiate DMARD therapy in a population of patients with early undifferentiated synovitis. Initiation of DMARD therapy was used as an indicator of the physician’s opinion that the patient was at risk of developing persistent and/or erosive arthritis that we would currently consider to be RA. Data on 3,115 patients from 9 early arthritis cohorts who were consid- ered not to have evidence of another possible diagnosis explaining their presentation were obtained. Between July 2007 and November 2008 an expert working group developed an analysis strategy that related an agreed- upon list of standardized clinical and laboratory vari- ables collected at baseline to the initiation of DMARD treatment within the next 12 months. MTX initiation was used as the gold standard for this purpose. The analytical process aimed to identify the independent contribution of each variable on this list and included univariate regression modeling, a subsequent principal components analysis, and a multivariate regression model that included all identified components (25). The resulting list of informative variables identified during that process and the weights based on the odds ratios are shown in Table 1. Phase 2. Phase 2 consisted of a consensus-based, decision science–informed approach, which took place between November 2008 and June 2009. The purpose of this phase was to derive a clinician-based judgment on

(cid:2) The panel recommends that clinicians offer multi- modal analgesia, or the use of a variety of analgesic medications and techniques combined with non- pharmacological interventions, for the treatment of postoperative pain in children and adults (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Multimodal analgesia, defined as the use of a variety of analgesic medication and techniques that target different mechanisms of action in the peripheral and/or central nervous system (which might also be combined with nonpharmacological interventions) might have ad- ditiveorsynergisticeffectsandmoreeffectivepainrelief compared with single-modality interventions. For example, clinicians might offer local anesthetic-based regional (peripheral and neuraxial) analgesic techniques in combination with systemic opioids and other analge- sics as part of a multimodal approach to perioperative pain. Because of the availability of effective nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies for postop- erative pain management, the panel suggests that clini- cians routinely incorporate around the clock nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies into multi- modal analgesia regimens. Systemic opioids might not be required in all patients. One study suggests that it shouldbeavoidedwhennotneeded,becauselimitedev- idence suggests that perioperative opioid therapy might be associated with increased likelihood of long-term opioid use, with its attendant risks.4

The numbers in each block are codes for the treatment given to each animal. The purpose of such a design is to reduce heterogeneity associated with time, space and some physical varia- tion. The five animals in Block 1 would be chosen to be as similar as possible with respect to age, weight, genotype and any other variable which might influence the outcome. They would then be assigned at random to one of the five treatments. The animals would be housed in close proximity, and possibly even in the same cage, if the different treatments can be given in such a situation. When measurements are to be made on the animals, those in Block 1 would be treated as a group, with all measurements being made within a short period by the same per- son. Animals in the other blocks would likewise be selected to be as uniform as possible, but might differ in body weight or age, etc. from those in Block 1. They could be measured at a dif- ferent time, if necessary by a different person. Thus, within each block any comparison among treatments would be made on animals which are in all possible ways as similar as possible. The unwanted variation shows up as differences between blocks. This is then removed mathe- matically in the statistical analysis.

The FDA recently recommended that a warning be issued regarding adverse effects associated with BzRA hypnotics. These medications have been associated with reports of disruptive sleep related behaviors including sleepwalking, eating, driving, and sexual behavior. Patients should be cautioned about the potential for these adverse effects, and about the importance of allowing appropriate sleep time, using only prescribed doses and avoiding the combination of BzRA hypnotics with alcohol, other sedatives, and sleep restriction.

veys, and frequent teleconference discussions, the expert panel identified consensus areas and recommendations for those areas not covered by AASM practice parameters. Recommendations were generated by panel members and discussed by all. To min- imize individual expert bias, the group anonymously voted and rated consensus recommendations from 1: strongly disagree to 9: strongly agree. Consensus was defined when all experts rated a recommendation 8 or 9. If consensus was not evident after the first vote, the consensus recommendations were discussed again, amended as appropriate, and a second anonymous vote was conducted. If consensus was not evident after the second vote, the process was repeated until consensus was attained to include or exclude a recommendation.

The efficacy of a combination of a 4-aminoquinoline drug (either chloroquine or amo- diaquine) with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine has been reviewed (43). The results of this review sug- gested that the addition of either chloroquine or amodiaquine to SP marginally improved parasitological clearance (compared with SP alone). The studies reviewed were mostly done in areas and at times when both SP and chloroquine/amodi- aquine retained a fair amount of efficacy, and it is not clear from these studies how well such a combination would act in areas where one of the components was significantly compromised. Additionally, to date, there are no data to suggest whether this slightly improved clearance would

1989). In the 1990’s newer agents were developed and marketed that had selective effects on GABA receptors in- cluding Zolpidem (Ambien), Zaleplon (Sonata), Eszopi- clone (Estorra) and Indiplon. While all hypnotics have abuse potential for individuals with addictive histories and personalities, these agents have been noted to have min- imal additive potential (Hajak et al. 2003). These agents are less likely to have deleterious side effects than most OTC treatments for insomnia, however, with increased use, more side effects including next effects on driving have been reported. This effect as well as next day re- bound insomnia has particularly been reported for higher doses of zolpidem (Verster et al. 2002). In many cases, MVA’s occurred in the period of somnolence and cogni- tive impairment during the first few hours after ingestion. Comparatively normal results on psychomotor tests can be obtained 3.25 h. after zaleplon ingestion and 6.25 h. after zopiclone ingestion (Paul et al. 2003). While these agents have excellent efficacy with minimal side effects, at higher doses these agents can exhibit benzodiazepine-like effects. Idiosyncratic reactions of persistent daytime som- nolence and/or memory loss have been reported. Some patients will report next day sedation after the nighttime use of these agents, as well as demonstrate an increased error rate in driving tests (Verster et al. 2007). Such infor- mation was forthcoming only after these drugs became generic and widely utilized in clinical practice. Most sedat- ing drugs if adopted into such widespread use would also be at least as likely to demonstrate epidemiological effects on MVA’s and MVA associated deaths. In the elderly, chronic use of sedating drugs (particularly those with anti-cholinergic side effects) can be associated with an increased risk for falls, and confusion (American Geriatrics Society 2015). Reported next day sleepiness and other side effects associated with hypnotic use are summarized in Table 3. The newer GABA-effective hypnotics are the only medications with demonstrated effectiveness in treating chronic insomnia (NIH State of the Science Conference

medicine when following up n candidate molecules. The numerical solutions for this equation show that at least 48 molecules are to be evaluated for this probability to exceed 90%. The MMV discovery portfolio was built and funded to deliver two new preclinical candidates per year, and allowing for a third molecule coming from else- where, then this would still require some 16 years’ invest- ment per combination, except if there is a considerable increase in success rates going forwards (and a justifica- tion for this), or significantly increased investment. The hope on the horizon is that many of the new molecules are first-in-class, and so should they fail in clinical devel- opment there will be scope for well-defined back-up pro- jects, and these are normally much more cost-effective programmes. The definition of new molecular targets also opens up new possibilities for engaging the wider research community, allowing access to resources such as the EU’s European Lead Factory, which considers molec- ular targets but not phenotypic approaches.

The analysis found that low-income countries could spend on average up to US$ 3800 per cancer patient annually on cancer medicines for all newly-diagnosed cancer patients, and the total expenditure on these medicines would be within the generously assumed 5% of the total health expenditure (Table 4.2). In high- income countries, the analysis found that a budget threshold of 5% of the total health expenditure would allow a spending of up to US$ 40 600 on cancer medicines per patient per year, with a view to providing universal coverage.

In this paper, we describe a novel feature space designed to effectively classify the polarity and strength of relationships extracted from biomedical abstracts. In addition to the conventional syntactic features such as unigrams and bigrams, we have also explored and constructed semantics-based sequential features. These features are constructed at three different levels: entity, phrase, and sentence. A wrapper-based method is then used to select the optimal feature sets for both polarity and strength prediction. Specifically, a multi-stage SVM classifier and an SVR predictor are built for polarity and strength prediction, respectively. Two different schemas, namely, (1 vs. all) and (2 vs. 2), are employed to build the multi-stage SVM. Finally, three different kernel functions are considered at different stage of this SVM classifier. Our intensive evaluations have shown that for polarity prediction, the (2 vs. 2) schema in general works better than the (1 vs. all). It produces the highest polarity accuracy of 0.91 when both unigrams and semantics-based sequential structures (KSS) are used, with a standard error ranging between 0.01~0.02. On the other hand, we find that for strength prediction, unigrams solely can produce satisfying results. We obtain a high accuracy of 0.96, with the standard error ranging between 0.61%~0.63% for the strength analysis. We are currently expanding our annotated corpus to facilitate further validation of the findings reported in this work. We are also integrating this module with other modules as shown in Figure 1 towards building a quantitative food-disease-gene network. Finally, we are creating an interactive user interface to visually present this network.

Phase 1. The aim of Phase 1 was to identify the contributions of clinical and laboratory variables that in practice were the most predictive of the decision to initiate DMARD therapy in a population of patients with early undifferentiated synovitis. Initiation of DMARD therapy was used as an indicator of the physician’s opinion that the patient was at risk of developing persistent and/or erosive arthritis that we would currently consider to be RA. Data on 3,115 patients from 9 early arthritis cohorts who were consid- ered not to have evidence of another possible diagnosis explaining their presentation were obtained. Between July 2007 and November 2008 an expert working group developed an analysis strategy that related an agreed- upon list of standardized clinical and laboratory vari- ables collected at baseline to the initiation of DMARD treatment within the next 12 months. MTX initiation was used as the gold standard for this purpose. The analytical process aimed to identify the independent contribution of each variable on this list and included univariate regression modeling, a subsequent principal components analysis, and a multivariate regression model that included all identified components (25). The resulting list of informative variables identified during that process and the weights based on the odds ratios are shown in Table 1. Phase 2. Phase 2 consisted of a consensus-based, decision science–informed approach, which took place between November 2008 and June 2009. The purpose of this phase was to derive a clinician-based judgment on

Readership analysis was conducted on the 20 science journals in our data set (n(cid:1)2903). Articles published in the social sciences and humanities journals (n(cid:1)350) were omitted from the readership analysis, as many did not include abstract or full-text versions of their articles, and, in some cases, refer- ence views were added to full-text views, resulting in indeter- minate and incomparable results. Citation analyses were conducted on the entire article data set (n(cid:1)3245). A logistic regression model was used to estimate the likelihood of articles in each experimental group being cited within the first year after publication, controlling for journal and journal category effects.

President Obama has recently expressed a strong conviction that “Science offers great potential for improving health”. The President has announced a research initiative that aims to accelerate progress toward a new era of precision medicine. The time is accurate for this idealistic initiative, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other partners will work to attain this vision [7]. The concept of precision medicine speaks of prevention and treatment strategies that take individual variability into account. Even though it is not new, the impact of practicality is still deprived. If one considers blood typing, for instance, has been used to guide blood transfusions for more than a century. But the vision of applying this concept broadly has been intensely improved by the latest development of large-scale biologic databases (such as the human genome sequence), powerful methods for typifying patients (such as proteomics, metabolomics, genomics, diverse cellular assays, and even mobile health technology), and computational tools for analyzing large sets of data.

Dose ranging test: Here, compounds are tested at a minimum of 4 different doses (the “dose ranging, full 4-day test”, typically 100, 30, 10 and 3 mg/kg, by both s.c. and p.o. routes of administration). ED 50 and ED 90 values are calculated by plotting the log dose against probit activity (for example, using Microcal “Origin”). These reflect the drug concentrations at which 50% and 90% of suppression of parasitemia is achieved. Note that with short half-life drugs it may be necessary to dose multiple times per day. Two other parameters measured in this study are relative potency compared to an appropriate standard drug, and oral bioavailability (assessed by comparison of oral and parenteral administration).

medically related text and metadata features, such as “pa- tients,” “alzheimer,” “health information management,” and “medicine” are also important and of mostly positive polar- ity, since medical articles attract greater news coverage than, say, a recently published computer science paper. As we dis- cuss later, the presence of “alzheimer” as an important, neg- ative feature is more an artifact of the dataset than an iden- tification of trends in popularity. We also find an artifact of year (2016) of the dataset with the feature “zika virus,” due to the 2015-2016 zika epidemic in North and South Amer- ica.

considerable challenge in assessing, measuring and translating the value of a medicine to a price. In particular, there is no universally accepted view on what dimensions of value should be considered for the purpose of determining medicine prices. Fig. 3.8 (p.34) shows the various dimensions of value noted in the literature and government guidelines, summarized into eight themes. Common dimensions considered in health technology assessments are: clinical and public health needs for the proposed medicine, clinical evidence, economic and financial public health considerations. More debatable is whether to include as innovativeness of the medicine, and the need to incentivize future

veys, and frequent teleconference discussions, the expert panel identified consensus areas and recommendations for those areas not covered by AASM practice parameters. Recommendations were generated by panel members and discussed by all. To min- imize individual expert bias, the group anonymously voted and rated consensus recommendations from 1: strongly disagree to 9: strongly agree. Consensus was defined when all experts rated a recommendation 8 or 9. If consensus was not evident after the first vote, the consensus recommendations were discussed again, amended as appropriate, and a second anonymous vote was conducted. If consensus was not evident after the second vote, the process was repeated until consensus was attained to include or exclude a recommendation.

OOP costs in the year of diagnosis came mostly from professional and non-inpatient facility services. Figure 8 shows the level of OOP costs by percentile for all study cancers combined. In general, patient cost-sharing is higher for out-of-network services than in-network. Not surprisingly, cancer patients in the highest decile of OOP spending also incurred the highest portion of OOP costs for out- of-network providers; conversely, patients in the lowest decile incurred the lowest portion of OOP costs for out-of-network providers.
prices of pharmaceuticals grew faster than the collective prices of all goods and services (Fig. 4.6a, p.61). However, the trends in the two countries began to diverge in the late 1980s where the price level of medicines continued to rise faster in the USA, while the growth rate of pharmaceutical prices in Australia seemed to have been stabilized at around 10% higher than the consumer price index. This could possibly be due to the introduction of “cost effectiveness” as a requirement before listing a medicine on the national pharmaceutical insurance scheme, so as to ensure the benefits of a given medicine were high enough to justify the price requested by the manufacturer (246). The divergence became more prominent when the Australian Government undertook further reforms of its national scheme after 2005 (247), which was implemented in response to a report that warned “in 40 years’ time, the PBS could account for 3.4% of GDP, making it the largest part of the Government’s spending on health” (248). The reforms seem to have resulted in gradual normalization of the growth rate of medicine prices in Australia to a level in line with the overall inflation rate of other consumer goods (Fig. 4.6a). In contrast, medicine prices continued to grow considerably in the USA, with the cumulative growth reaching 2.4 times the overall inflation rate of other consumer goods in 2017. Of note, the price level of prescription medicines in the USA rose in parallel with Pricing and reimbursement policies in Australia over four decades have controlled the growth rate of medicine prices.

Proper Sizing-Firebox dimensions should be selected so that the fire fills the combustion chamber during operation. This provides greater heating efficiency. Careful consideration should be given to size of the fireplace opening best suited for the room in which it is to be located. Location and size are important not only from the standpoint of appearance, but also of operation. If the fireplace opening is too small, it may function properly but will not produce enough heat to warm the room. If the opening is too large, a fire that would fill the combustion chamber may overwhelm the room. In such a case, the firebox opening would require a larger flue area and consume larger amounts of interior air even if exterior combustion air is provided. Table 2 provides suggested widths of conventional fireplace openings appropriate for various room sizes. For example, a room with 300 ft2 (28 m2) of floor area is best served by a fireplace with an opening 30 in. (750 mm) to 36 in. (900 mm) wide.

How   easy  is the paper to understand?
Composite or combination flashings are typically less expensive than sheet metal and are easier to install. The most predominant type is a thin layer of metal sandwiched between one or two layers of another material. The metal layer is usually of aluminum, copper or lead. It is covered on one or both sides with various materials, such as asphalt coatings, kraft paper, fiberglass fabric or plastic films. Product literature should be reviewed to determine whether these materials are appropriate for use in brick masonry cavity walls. Consideration should be given to compatibility with adjacent sealants, delamination due to moisture penetration and movement of the wall system.
What is the purpose of a RA and what makes it a good one, and who decides that it is a good RA? Are there rules for easier writing? If the main function of a RA is to transfer a new knowledge on a research topic, then a good paper is the one that is clear, coherent, focused, well argued and uses language that does not have ambiguous or equivoque meaning. However, it is not only the message that is important. The RA must have a well-defined structure and function in serve like a cook-book, so the others can reproduce and repeat explained experiments. Answer research questions Give summary conclusions There are some rules that can make the writing and publishing of RAs 'easier'. Here, we summarised some 'golden' rules that should always be in the mind of an inexperienced researcher (Table 3). We put all these together to make a final list of some 40 logical steps, which can be find in the Appendix.

The numbers in each block are codes for the treatment given to each animal. The purpose of such a design is to reduce heterogeneity associated with time, space and some physical varia- tion. The five animals in Block 1 would be chosen to be as similar as possible with respect to age, weight, genotype and any other variable which might influence the outcome. They would then be assigned at random to one of the five treatments. The animals would be housed in close proximity, and possibly even in the same cage, if the different treatments can be given in such a situation. When measurements are to be made on the animals, those in Block 1 would be treated as a group, with all measurements being made within a short period by the same per- son. Animals in the other blocks would likewise be selected to be as uniform as possible, but might differ in body weight or age, etc. from those in Block 1. They could be measured at a dif- ferent time, if necessary by a different person. Thus, within each block any comparison among treatments would be made on animals which are in all possible ways as similar as possible. The unwanted variation shows up as differences between blocks. This is then removed mathe- matically in the statistical analysis.
Results from the tests showed that the average value of critical thinking ability to the average achievement after the testing ended, showed the relationship was statistically significant (.05). As a result, the researchers compared the results of Table 4 and determined that after the posttest, data showed the average of critical thinking ability and post-learning achievement were higher than before the study.

Dose ranging test: Here, compounds are tested at a minimum of 4 different doses (the “dose ranging, full 4-day test”, typically 100, 30, 10 and 3 mg/kg, by both s.c. and p.o. routes of administration). ED 50 and ED 90 values are calculated by plotting the log dose against probit activity (for example, using Microcal “Origin”). These reflect the drug concentrations at which 50% and 90% of suppression of parasitemia is achieved. Note that with short half-life drugs it may be necessary to dose multiple times per day. Two other parameters measured in this study are relative potency compared to an appropriate standard drug, and oral bioavailability (assessed by comparison of oral and parenteral administration). However,

industry for anti-infectives overall, and significantly better than for other therapeutic areas, such as neurol- ogy and oncology. One difficulty with such an analysis is that new chemotypes have an inherently higher risk than additional members of established chemical classes, other than the risks of failure due to resistance (which are higher for drugs that have been used for many years). For this review’s new analysis (Table 8), new chemotypes are separated from life-cycle management projects. The overall success rates have not changed significantly in the last 3 years, either for MMV or for the CMR benchmark, which is reassuring. The data shows that a new molecule in formal preclinical evaluation has an 8% chance of becoming part of a product.

The statewide assessments in mathematics, reading, and science are used to measure whether students, and their school and district, are meeting the academic standards. Statewide assessments are one measure of how well students are doing on the content that is part of their daily instruction. It is also a measure of how well schools and districts are doing in aligning their curriculum and teaching the standards.

With some variation over time and across cancer types, care for the cancer population involves the six categories of services analyzed. The bars in Figures 2a-2c indicate that some patients had significant use of facility services in the year preceding the cancer diagnosis. For both colorectal and lung cancers, total spending on hospital inpatient increased as a percentage of total immediately following diagnosis. In all three cancers, the chemotherapy share of total spending increased rapidly in the first few months after diagnosis and, with the exception of breast cancer, continued at a fairly consistent level of around 20% of spending in subsequent years. Radiation therapy represented a small share of total spending except for breast cancer patients in the year following diagnosis.

a physician intentionally stimulates a physiologic response by CO 2 inhalation [31], sodium lactate infusion [32,33], or cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4) injection [32,34]. These chemical exposures are used as potent tools to design controlled studies with predictable levels of PA episodes. In a study with healthy volunteer subjects using carbon dioxide inhalation to provoke panic and anxiety, propranolol significantly decreased heart rate, a cardiovascular somatic symptom, but did not provide psychic anxiolytic benefit [35].

These assignment guidelines pertain exclusively to Commercial Mobile Radio Service providers (CMRS). The IMSI Administrator directly administers only the Home Network Identity (HNI) segment of the resource. The HNI uniquely identifies the home wireless network of a FCC- licensed two-way CMRS subscriber and contains the Mobile Country Code (MCC) and the Mobile Network Code (MNC). The remaining segment of the IMSI, the Mobile Station Identification Number (MSIN), is directly administered by the wireless network licensee to which the HNI is assigned. Issue: In 1998, ITU Recommendation E.212 was modified allowing IMSI assignments to those Wireline Service Providers offering limited mobility services. As a result, HNI assignments are no longer available exclusively to CMRS providers. The current IMSI assignment and administrative guidelines do not however reflect these modifications.

veys, and frequent teleconference discussions, the expert panel identified consensus areas and recommendations for those areas not covered by AASM practice parameters. Recommendations were generated by panel members and discussed by all. To min- imize individual expert bias, the group anonymously voted and rated consensus recommendations from 1: strongly disagree to 9: strongly agree. Consensus was defined when all experts rated a recommendation 8 or 9. If consensus was not evident after the first vote, the consensus recommendations were discussed again, amended as appropriate, and a second anonymous vote was conducted. If consensus was not evident after the second vote, the process was repeated until consensus was attained to include or exclude a recommendation.

What is the purpose of a RA and what makes it a good one, and who decides that it is a good RA? Are there rules for easier writing? If the main function of a RA is to transfer a new knowledge on a research topic, then a good paper is the one that is clear, coherent, focused, well argued and uses language that does not have ambiguous or equivoque meaning. However, it is not only the message that is important. The RA must have a well-defined structure and function in serve like a cook-book, so the others can reproduce and repeat explained experiments. Answer research questions Give summary conclusions There are some rules that can make the writing and publishing of RAs 'easier'. Here, we summarised some 'golden' rules that should always be in the mind of an inexperienced researcher (Table 3). We put all these together to make a final list of some 40 logical steps, which can be find in the Appendix.

1989). In the 1990’s newer agents were developed and marketed that had selective effects on GABA receptors in- cluding Zolpidem (Ambien), Zaleplon (Sonata), Eszopi- clone (Estorra) and Indiplon. While all hypnotics have abuse potential for individuals with addictive histories and personalities, these agents have been noted to have min- imal additive potential (Hajak et al. 2003). These agents are less likely to have deleterious side effects than most OTC treatments for insomnia, however, with increased use, more side effects including next effects on driving have been reported. This effect as well as next day re- bound insomnia has particularly been reported for higher doses of zolpidem (Verster et al. 2002). In many cases, MVA’s occurred in the period of somnolence and cogni- tive impairment during the first few hours after ingestion. Comparatively normal results on psychomotor tests can be obtained 3.25 h. after zaleplon ingestion and 6.25 h. after zopiclone ingestion (Paul et al. 2003). While these agents have excellent efficacy with minimal side effects, at higher doses these agents can exhibit benzodiazepine-like effects. Idiosyncratic reactions of persistent daytime som- nolence and/or memory loss have been reported. Some patients will report next day sedation after the nighttime use of these agents, as well as demonstrate an increased error rate in driving tests (Verster et al. 2007). Such infor- mation was forthcoming only after these drugs became generic and widely utilized in clinical practice. Most sedat- ing drugs if adopted into such widespread use would also be at least as likely to demonstrate epidemiological effects on MVA’s and MVA associated deaths. In the elderly, chronic use of sedating drugs (particularly those with anti-cholinergic side effects) can be associated with an increased risk for falls, and confusion (American Geriatrics Society 2015). Reported next day sleepiness and other side effects associated with hypnotic use are summarized in Table 3. The newer GABA-effective hypnotics are the only medications with demonstrated effectiveness in treating chronic insomnia (NIH State of the Science Conference

considerable challenge in assessing, measuring and translating the value of a medicine to a price. In particular, there is no universally accepted view on what dimensions of value should be considered for the purpose of determining medicine prices. Fig. 3.8 (p.34) shows the various dimensions of value noted in the literature and government guidelines, summarized into eight themes. Common dimensions considered in health technology assessments are: clinical and public health needs for the proposed medicine, clinical evidence, economic and financial public health considerations. More debatable is whether to include as innovativeness of the medicine, and the need to incentivize future

Efflorescence is normally a harmless deposit of water- soluble, white salt crystals, as shown in Photo 1. In some instances efflorescence may appear on mortar joints as shown in Photo 2. Efflorescence may appear in limited areas on the surface of brickwork as shown in Photo 3 or, in extreme cases, cover the entire brickwork surface.
The naïve interpretation of this is that no more than 13 candidate compounds would be needed for a reasonable chance of launching one new medicine, and 25 for a com- bination with two NCEs (new chemical entities). How- ever, if one aims for a 90% overall chance of success (P), the number of candidates n, each with a success probabil- ity s (8%) is described by the negative binomial distribu- tion in Eq. 1.

somnolence as a side effect is reproducible in susceptible individuals (White and Rumbold 1988). Sedation is a com- mon side effect of the traditional antipsychotics, with chlorpromazine and thioridazine somewhat more sedating than haloperidol. Clinical studies have shown a high inci- dence of persistent sedation with clozapine (46%) with less frequent reports of sedation with risperidone, olanzapine, sertindole and quetiapine (Monti et al. 2016). The sed- ation associated with these agents is most likely associated with their known effects on histaminic receptors. Doxepin, a sedating psychotropic agent with pro- nounced histamine (H-1) receptor antagonism exerts at least part of its effects by antagonizing orexin (Krystal et al. 2013). Suvorexant, is an orexin antagonist designed to lower waking arousal (Norman and Anderson 2016). Currently, it is being heavily marketed as a hypnotic (Rhyne and Anderson 2015). As based on performance and driving tests, this agent is known to produce a dose-related next day increase in somnolence for all age groupings tested (Farkus 2013). Sedative drug effects on daytime sleepiness are summarized in Table 4.

Composite or combination flashings are typically less expensive than sheet metal and are easier to install. The most predominant type is a thin layer of metal sandwiched between one or two layers of another material. The metal layer is usually of aluminum, copper or lead. It is covered on one or both sides with various materials, such as asphalt coatings, kraft paper, fiberglass fabric or plastic films. Product literature should be reviewed to determine whether these materials are appropriate for use in brick masonry cavity walls. Consideration should be given to compatibility with adjacent sealants, delamination due to moisture penetration and movement of the wall system.
istic option. Clinical diagnosis offers the advantages of ease, speed, and low cost. In areas where malaria is prevalent, clinical diagnosis usually results in all patients with fever and no apparent other cause being treated for malaria. This approach can iden- tify most patients who truly need antimalarial treat- ment, but it is also likely to misclassify many who do not (15). Over-diagnosis can be considerable and contributes to misuse of antimalarial drugs. Considerable overlap exists between the signs and

return-to-sport progression is individualised and is a function of the injury, the athlete’s age, prior SRC and level of play, and the ability to provide close supervision during the return to activity. The return-to-sport progression presented by the CISG is widely accepted but empiric, without evidence to support either the progression sequence or the time spent in each stage. In general, for young athletes, each stage of the progression should be at least 24 hours without return of symptoms before progressing to the next stage. (C)
The randomization, selection, and manipulation of access status for treatment articles were controlled entirely by the researcher, who was provided with direct access to the admin- istration of the journal websites. Authors and editors were not alerted as to which articles received the open access treat- ment. For some journals, treatment articles were indicated on the journal websites by an open lock icon.

under mefloquine or metformin single-drug treatments (P = 0.013 and P = 0.041; Figure 3C). Of note, mice under single or combined metformin treatments showed an extended survival, whereas 84% of the nontreat- ed mice succumbed within 1 week after infection (Table 1). In conclusion, metformin treatment in combi- nation with suboptimal dosage of conventional antimalarials is more efficacious in reducing parasite load.

The inclusion of SPX Weeklys in the VIX Index calculation means that the near-term options will always have more than 23 days to expiration and the next-term options always have less than 37 days to expiration, so the resulting VIX Index value will always reflect an interpolation of σ2 1 and σ2 2 ; i.e., each individual weight is less than or equal to 1 and the sum of the weights equals 1.
A similar calculation is performed for each option. The resulting values for the near-term options are then summed and multiplied by 2/T 1. Likewise, the resulting values for the next-term options are summed and multiplied by 2/T 2. The table below summarizes the results for each strip of options.
considerable challenge in assessing, measuring and translating the value of a medicine to a price. In particular, there is no universally accepted view on what dimensions of value should be considered for the purpose of determining medicine prices. Fig. 3.8 (p.34) shows the various dimensions of value noted in the literature and government guidelines, summarized into eight themes. Common dimensions considered in health technology assessments are: clinical and public health needs for the proposed medicine, clinical evidence, economic and financial public health considerations. More debatable is whether to include as innovativeness of the medicine, and the need to incentivize future

A patient’s decision to use an OON provider selection may be intentional or accidental. Reasons patients may incur OON costs include patient preference for a particular provider or specialty care center that may be out of network, the lack of network providers with appropriate specialists, and the lack of awareness or transparency about which providers are in the patient’s plan network. Common scenarios for accidental use of OON providers are emergency care or care from an OON provider working at an in-network hospital (e.g., radiologist, assistant surgeon, anesthesiologist).22 23 Figure 9 suggests that there might be significant financial consequences to the patient going out of network, which could be exacerbated if health plans remove popular cancer providers from their networks. Figure 9 also provides information on the relationship between the OON percentage (right vertical axis--relative to total spending) and total patient cost-sharing (left vertical axis). While most patients in our study reported under 10% of all OOP cost in the year of diagnosis is spent on out-of- network providers, those in the highest percentile of OOP spending incurred as much as 40% of those costs out-of-network.

Properties of insulation materials vary widely. Table 3 shows various properties of insulation materials used in brick masonry cavity walls. The thermal conductivity (k) and thermal resistance (R) provide a means of comparing the insulating properties of insulation materials. These are determined in accordance with ASTM C 177 Test Method for Steady-State Heat Flux Measurements and Thermal Transmission Properties by Means of the Guarded-Hot-Plate Apparatus measured at various temperatures. Due to the large number of types of insulation, and even larger number of manufacturers, Table 3 lists only a few representative values of physical properties. For some materials, an aged or stabilized value is given. In all cases, the aged or stabilized value is the one that should be used in design. Individual manufacturers should be consulted for design values and other properties of their specific materials and their applications.

medicine (NMM) and OMM obtain many more hundreds of hours of manual medicine training in a wider variety of clinical settings than DCs and other DOs. This section was meant to give you a better sense of what “osteopathic manipulative medicine” entails, and hopefully it answered most of your questions regarding OMM. The effectiveness of OMM remains a topic of ongoing debate and research despite past and current efforts to lay these arguments to rest. Whether an osteo- pathic physician uses OMM in his or her practice is based entirely on preference. With that said, it is an important core discipline and primary distinction of the osteopathic profession.

of care data [ 12 ] . The NCI estimate for expenditure on prostate cancer treatment in 2006 was $9.862 billion, and average Medicare payments per patient in the fi rst year after diagnosis were $11 000. It should be noted when interpreting this data that use of PSA testing for prostate cancer is more widespread in the USA than in many other countries, thus increasing the number of cases identifi ed. In addition, Medicare did not cover certain cancer care expenses such as oral medicines, commonly used to treat prostate cancer until January 2006. These out-of-pocket costs may comprise 10% of the $11 000 estimate. Direct medical expenditures are only one part of the total economic burden of cancer, as cancer- related illnesses and death lead to losses in economic productivity.

Reassessments might be per- formed less frequently for patients with more stable pain (eg, patients who have exhibited good pain con- trol without side effects after 24 hours of stable ther- apy). Pain reassessments might be useful at the time of nursing shift changes or with new caregivers to establish a baseline and promote continuity of care, although evidence showing that routine reassessment of pain at nursing shift changes is associated with improved clinical outcomes is not available.

In summary, public and non-profit-making sectors, and by extension tax-payers and philanthropists, have provided considerable financial and non-financial contributions towards the R&amp;D of cancer medicines. This means that in many cases, pharmaceutical companies have not incurred the full costs of R&amp;D. The pharmaceutical industry has also benefited greatly from the knowledge generated by public-sector investments in R&amp;D, and by having access to research supported by public funding at costs, if any, lower than the market value.

President Obama has recently expressed a strong conviction that “Science offers great potential for improving health”. The President has announced a research initiative that aims to accelerate progress toward a new era of precision medicine. The time is accurate for this idealistic initiative, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other partners will work to attain this vision [7]. The concept of precision medicine speaks of prevention and treatment strategies that take individual variability into account. Even though it is not new, the impact of practicality is still deprived. If one considers blood typing, for instance, has been used to guide blood transfusions for more than a century. But the vision of applying this concept broadly has been intensely improved by the latest development of large-scale biologic databases (such as the human genome sequence), powerful methods for typifying patients (such as proteomics, metabolomics, genomics, diverse cellular assays, and even mobile health technology), and computational tools for analyzing large sets of data. Francis S.Collins et al. stated that, “What is necessary now is a broad

a physician intentionally stimulates a physiologic response by CO 2 inhalation [31], sodium lactate infusion [32,33], or cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4) injection [32,34]. These chemical exposures are used as potent tools to design controlled studies with predictable levels of PA episodes. In a study with healthy volunteer subjects using carbon dioxide inhalation to provoke panic and anxiety, propranolol significantly decreased heart rate, a cardiovascular somatic symptom, but did not provide psychic anxiolytic benefit [35].

INDEX    TO   COVERAGE        SUMMARY
Your child has been identified as needing services for English Language Learners (ELL). Your child will be placed in the ESL/Bilingual Education dual language immersion program, as outlined in the attached document. We believe that this program will help meet your child’s educational needs and enhance his/her academic success in school. Your child will be assessed twice yearly, or as needed, to determine progress toward individual ELL goals. When your child scores in the acceptable range (4.5 Literacy/5.0 Overall) on all areas of the W-APT or ACCESS assessment they will be exited from the program. If your student currently has an Individualized Education Program (IEP), their needs will continue to be met through their current accommodations.

A patient’s decision to use an OON provider selection may be intentional or accidental. Reasons patients may incur OON costs include patient preference for a particular provider or specialty care center that may be out of network, the lack of network providers with appropriate specialists, and the lack of awareness or transparency about which providers are in the patient’s plan network. Common scenarios for accidental use of OON providers are emergency care or care from an OON provider working at an in-network hospital (e.g., radiologist, assistant surgeon, anesthesiologist).22 23 Figure 9 suggests that there might be significant financial consequences to the patient going out of network, which could be exacerbated if health plans remove popular cancer providers from their networks. Figure 9 also provides information on the relationship between the OON percentage (right vertical axis--relative to total spending) and total patient cost-sharing (left vertical axis). While most patients in our study reported under 10% of all OOP cost in the year of diagnosis is spent on out-of- network providers, those in the highest percentile of OOP spending incurred as much as 40% of those costs out-of-network.
veys, and frequent teleconference discussions, the expert panel identified consensus areas and recommendations for those areas not covered by AASM practice parameters. Recommendations were generated by panel members and discussed by all. To min- imize individual expert bias, the group anonymously voted and rated consensus recommendations from 1: strongly disagree to 9: strongly agree. Consensus was defined when all experts rated a recommendation 8 or 9. If consensus was not evident after the first vote, the consensus recommendations were discussed again, amended as appropriate, and a second anonymous vote was conducted. If consensus was not evident after the second vote, the process was repeated until consensus was attained to include or exclude a recommendation.

medically related text and metadata features, such as “pa- tients,” “alzheimer,” “health information management,” and “medicine” are also important and of mostly positive polar- ity, since medical articles attract greater news coverage than, say, a recently published computer science paper. As we dis- cuss later, the presence of “alzheimer” as an important, neg- ative feature is more an artifact of the dataset than an iden- tification of trends in popularity. We also find an artifact of year (2016) of the dataset with the feature “zika virus,” due to the 2015-2016 zika epidemic in North and South Amer- ica.

There are debates about whether the returns generated from the sales of medicines, including cancer medicines, are sufficient for pharmaceutical companies to cover their past R&amp;D expenses, maintain their operations and engage in future drug discovery research. For example, some commentators have observed that the revenue generated from the sales of imatinib had exceeded the costs of R&amp;D within two years and “the revenues over the subsequent years of the patent would represent generous profits to the company” (30). Another study found that total revenue from the sales of 10 cancer medicines since approval over a median of four years (US$ 67.0 billion) was 9.3 times the total R&amp;D spending of US$ 7.2 billion (or 7.4 times using an estimated risk-adjusted R&amp;D costs of US$ 9.1 billion) (94).
The structural design of cavity walls should follow either rational or empirical methods. The rational design method is based on the properties of the wall materials and engineering analysis. This method may be used for any structure where high loads are likely or where tall walls are a necessity. The empirical method is generally satisfactory for one and two-story buildings consisting of light construction with limited floor spans and wall heights; and for multistory buildings where unsupported wall heights are not excessive.
medicine when following up n candidate molecules. The numerical solutions for this equation show that at least 48 molecules are to be evaluated for this probability to exceed 90%. The MMV discovery portfolio was built and funded to deliver two new preclinical candidates per year, and allowing for a third molecule coming from else- where, then this would still require some 16 years’ invest- ment per combination, except if there is a considerable increase in success rates going forwards (and a justifica- tion for this), or significantly increased investment. The hope on the horizon is that many of the new molecules are first-in-class, and so should they fail in clinical devel- opment there will be scope for well-defined back-up pro- jects, and these are normally much more cost-effective programmes. The definition of new molecular targets also opens up new possibilities for engaging the wider research community, allowing access to resources such as the EU’s European Lead Factory, which considers molec- ular targets but not phenotypic approaches.

industry for anti-infectives overall, and significantly better than for other therapeutic areas, such as neurol- ogy and oncology. One difficulty with such an analysis is that new chemotypes have an inherently higher risk than additional members of established chemical classes, other than the risks of failure due to resistance (which are higher for drugs that have been used for many years). For this review’s new analysis (Table 8), new chemotypes are separated from life-cycle management projects. The overall success rates have not changed significantly in the last 3 years, either for MMV or for the CMR benchmark, which is reassuring. The data shows that a new molecule in formal preclinical evaluation has an 8% chance of becoming part of a product.

Of note, mice under single or combined metformin treatments showed an extended survival, whereas 84% of the nontreat- ed mice succumbed within 1 week after infection (Table 1). In conclusion, metformin treatment in combi- nation with suboptimal dosage of conventional antimalarials is more efficacious in reducing parasite load.

Numerous alternative beta blockers are available in lieu of propranolol. Notable among these is the common drug, atenolol, that is available in oral solid dose forms ranging from 25 to 100 mg for the treatment of hypertension. Multiple doses per day may be permitted. It has been used to suppress stage fright in performers when administered orally in advance [45]. Atenolol is a beta-1 selective peripheral-acting agent without CNS effects, which should reduce the risk for asthmatic subjects [46]. Thus, atenolol might be preferred over the nonselective beta blockers for patients affected by asthma or COPD [47]. Oral atenolol at 50 - 200 mg doses suppressed heart rate by ~ 23 - 24 beats per minute (bpm) vs. ~ 10 bpm on placebo [46]. Also,

Wind turbines will be used to harness the kinetic energy of the moving air over the oceans on the OCS and convert it to electricity. Offshore winds are less turbulent (because the ocean is flat relative to onshore topography), and they tend to flow at higher speeds than onshore winds, thus allowing turbines to produce more electricity. Because the potential energy produced from the wind is directly proportional to the cube of the wind speed, increased wind speeds of only a few miles per hour can produce a significantly larger amount of electricity. For instance, a turbine at a site with an average wind speed of 16 mph would produce 50% more electricity than at a site with the same turbine and average wind speeds of 14 mph (Offshore Wind 2006).

Canada has a national stopgap to protect consumers from price gouging. The Patient Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB), a consumer protection agency, has the authority to impose sanctions and price reductions for patented products deemed excessively priced. However, the PMPRB is hobbled in its ability to keep Canada’s drug spending low.
considerable challenge in assessing, measuring and translating the value of a medicine to a price. In particular, there is no universally accepted view on what dimensions of value should be considered for the purpose of determining medicine prices. Fig. 3.8 (p.34) shows the various dimensions of value noted in the literature and government guidelines, summarized into eight themes. Common dimensions considered in health technology assessments are: clinical and public health needs for the proposed medicine, clinical evidence, economic and financial public health considerations. More debatable is whether to include as innovativeness of the medicine, and the need to incentivize future

6. Identify the efflorescence. Knowing the composition of efflorescing salts is sometimes of use. Table 1, taken from Brownell’s report lists the most probable sources of efflorescing salts. Commercial testing laboratories can use X-ray diffraction, petrographic analysis or chemical analysis can, in some instances, determine both the type of salts present and their relative quantity. 7. Consider miscellaneous sources of water when all obvious sources have been eliminated. Some of these sources are: condensation within the wall, poorly directed landscape sprinklers, leaky pipes, faulty drains and condensation on heating or plumbing pipes. If necessary, condensation analysis methods are described in Technical Note 47.

a physician intentionally stimulates a physiologic response by CO 2 inhalation [31], sodium lactate infusion [32,33], or cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4) injection [32,34]. These chemical exposures are used as potent tools to design controlled studies with predictable levels of PA episodes. In a study with healthy volunteer subjects using carbon dioxide inhalation to provoke panic and anxiety, propranolol significantly decreased heart rate, a cardiovascular somatic symptom, but did not provide psychic anxiolytic benefit [35].

1. Decide when to clean. Mortar must harden prior to cleaning. It is generally best to schedule cleaning at least seven days after brickwork is completed. In some cases it may be possible to clean earlier; how- ever, effects on the masonry and influencing factors such as weather conditions and the type of brick and mortar should be carefully considered. Prolonged time periods between the completion of the masonry and cleaning should be avoided. After one month, mortar smears and splatters left on brickwork become increasingly difficult to remove. 2. Remove larger clumps of mortar using wooden paddles or nonmetallic tools. Metal tools may damage the brickwork or leave behind fragments that oxidize and cause rust stains. 3. Select the proper cleaning solution. There are many types of proprietary cleaners available that are for- mulated to remove specific stains or for use with a particular type of brick. Be careful to select cleaning products suitable for the brick, mortar and adjacent materials and follow the cleaner manufacturer’s rec- ommended instructions. Each product being considered should be evaluated as discussed previously in Trial Cleaning.

Composite or combination flashings are typically less expensive than sheet metal and are easier to install. The most predominant type is a thin layer of metal sandwiched between one or two layers of another material. The metal layer is usually of aluminum, copper or lead. It is covered on one or both sides with various materials, such as asphalt coatings, kraft paper, fiberglass fabric or plastic films. Product literature should be reviewed to determine whether these materials are appropriate for use in brick masonry cavity walls. Consideration should be given to compatibility with adjacent sealants, delamination due to moisture penetration and movement of the wall system.

The increase in full-text downloads for open access articles during their first year after publication suggests that the primary benefit to the nonsubscriber commu- nity is in browsing, as opposed to printing or saving, which would have been indicated by a commensurate increase in PDF downloads. The decrease in abstract views suggests a reader preference for the full docu- ment when available.

The key idea is that you should read the paper in up to three passes, instead of starting at the beginning and plow- ing your way to the end. Each pass accomplishes specific goals and builds upon the previous pass: The first pass gives you a general idea about the paper. The second pass lets you grasp the paper’s content, but not its details. The third pass helps you understand the paper in depth.

ability to sleep and the daytime consequences of poor sleep, dis- torted beliefs and attitudes about the origins and meaning of the insomnia, maladaptive efforts to accommodate to the condition (e.g., schedule or lifestyle changes), and excessive time spent awake in bed. The latter behavior is of particular significance in that it often is associated with “trying hard” to fall asleep and growing frustration and tension in the face of wakefulness. Thus, the bed becomes associated with a state of waking arousal as this conditioning paradigm repeats itself night after night.

industry for anti-infectives overall, and significantly better than for other therapeutic areas, such as neurol- ogy and oncology. One difficulty with such an analysis is that new chemotypes have an inherently higher risk than additional members of established chemical classes, other than the risks of failure due to resistance (which are higher for drugs that have been used for many years). For this review’s new analysis (Table 8), new chemotypes are separated from life-cycle management projects. The overall success rates have not changed significantly in the last 3 years, either for MMV or for the CMR benchmark, which is reassuring. The data shows that a new molecule in formal preclinical evaluation has an 8% chance of becoming part of a product.
There are many, often complicated, mechanisms of efflorescence. Simply stated, efflorescence occurs when water containing dissolved salts is brought to the surface of masonry, the water evaporates and the salts are left on the surface of the masonry. The salt solutions may migrate across surfaces of masonry units, between the mortar and units, or through the pores of the mortar or units.

• Mood disturbances and cognitive difficulties. Complaints of irritability, loss of interest, mild depression and anxi- ety are common among insomnia patients. Patients with chronic insomnia often complain of mental inefficiency, difficulty remembering, difficulty focusing attention, and difficulty with complex mental tasks. • Quality of life: The irritability and fatigue associated with insomnia may cause interpersonal difficulties for insomnia patients, or avoidance of such activities. Conversely, in- terpersonal difficulties may be an important contributor to insomnia problems for some individuals. Sleep and wak- ing problems may lead to restriction of daytime activities, including social events, exercise, or work. Lack of regular daytime activities and exercise may in turn contribute to insomnia. • Exacerbation of comorbid conditions. Comorbid condi- tions may cause or increase sleep difficulties. Likewise, poor sleep may exacerbate symptomatology of comorbid conditions. Sleep complaints may herald the onset of mood disorders or exacerbation of comorbid conditions. VI. Other History: A complete insomnia history also in- cludes medical, psychiatric, medication/substance, and family/ social/occupational histories. A wide range of medical (Table 5) and psychiatric (Table 6) conditions can be comorbid with

veys, and frequent teleconference discussions, the expert panel identified consensus areas and recommendations for those areas not covered by AASM practice parameters. Recommendations were generated by panel members and discussed by all. To min- imize individual expert bias, the group anonymously voted and rated consensus recommendations from 1: strongly disagree to 9: strongly agree. Consensus was defined when all experts rated a recommendation 8 or 9. If consensus was not evident after the first vote, the consensus recommendations were discussed again, amended as appropriate, and a second anonymous vote was conducted. If consensus was not evident after the second vote, the process was repeated until consensus was attained to include or exclude a recommendation.
The statewide assessments are how we as a state measure that curriculum and daily instruction in our schools are being aligned to the academics standards, ensuring all students are being provided an equitable education. Statewide assessment results are just one tool to monitor that we are providing our students with the education that will ensure a strong workforce and knowledgeable citizens.
medically related text and metadata features, such as “pa- tients,” “alzheimer,” “health information management,” and “medicine” are also important and of mostly positive polar- ity, since medical articles attract greater news coverage than, say, a recently published computer science paper. As we dis- cuss later, the presence of “alzheimer” as an important, neg- ative feature is more an artifact of the dataset than an iden- tification of trends in popularity. We also find an artifact of year (2016) of the dataset with the feature “zika virus,” due to the 2015-2016 zika epidemic in North and South Amer- ica.

Effective immediately, hospitals shall notify an EMS provider if a patient transported to the hospital by that provider’s EMS crew subsequently tests positive for the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus. Notification must occur within 48 hours of the positive test result. This is a change from the previous 12-hour notification requirement. Notification of a positive test result is required regardless of whether CDC’s recommended use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during transport of any individual with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 was observed. Notification shall not include the name of the patient who tested positive.

In the future, we would also like to increase the size of our con(cid:3)ated dataset and possibly create a biomedical all-words disambiguation test set to test our approach. Unlike SenseClusters, our approach can be used to perform all-words disambiguation. For example, given the sentence: His weight has fluctuated during the past month. We (cid:2)rst create a instance vector containing fluctuated, past and months for the word weight and a concept vector for each of its possible concepts, (cid:147)C0005912: Body Weight(cid:148) and (cid:147)C0699807: Quantitative Concept(cid:148) us- ing their context descriptions. We then calculate the cosine between the instance vector and each of the two concept vectors. The concept whose vector has the smallest cosine score is assigned to weight. We then repeat this process for fluctuated, past and months. We also plan to explore using different contex- tual information to improve the accuracy of our approach. We are currently exploring using co- occurrence and relational information about the pos- sible CUIs in the UMLS. Our IDF stoplist exper-

The analysis found that low-income countries could spend on average up to US$ 3800 per cancer patient annually on cancer medicines for all newly-diagnosed cancer patients, and the total expenditure on these medicines would be within the generously assumed 5% of the total health expenditure (Table 4.2). In high- income countries, the analysis found that a budget threshold of 5% of the total health expenditure would allow a spending of up to US$ 40 600 on cancer medicines per patient per year, with a view to providing universal coverage.

The prevailing models of emergency medical transport used in North America and Western Europe are quite costly and would be impractical for most low-income countries. Severe resource constraints, the poor condition of roads or trails, and a lack of fuel may dictate the utilization of a wider range of options. In the United Republic of Tanzania, for example, modes of emergency transportation include motor- boats, canoes, bicycles with trailers, tricycles with platforms, tractors with trailers, reconditioned vehicles, and ox carts (22).

Although, it was assumed that the 'thicker' articles with wider range of vocabulary is preferable in the editors hands, the editors (and probably the readers) prefer simple, clear and coherent writing, rather than a fancy or complex, pseudo-scientific style. Also Funkhouser and Maccoby (1971) showed that the information gain is especially enhanced by the “use of examples", i.e. it helps a lot to use some non-science material, such as everyday life parallels, historical points, etc. On the other hand, some sections, such as Introduction and Discussion, have to intrigue readers and attract interest and should therefore not be over-simplified. For example, a mysterious title can catch readers' attention and will be easily remembered (e.g.: T.Y. Li and J. Yorke named their famous paper on chaos: "The period three means chaos"). Some sections require more skill and are more important. It is approximated that from all published journal RAs in the world, only less than 5% are read in detail. However, more than 50% of abstracts are read and so the quality of an abstracts is much more important (Gordon, 1983). Therefore, the abstract should present the 'story' of the RA in miniature and should be readable standalone.
The IOM report supports these findings, stating that diagnostic errors contribute to 10% of patient deaths and 6-17% of hospital adverse events. Other researchers quantify the human cost of diagnostic errors at between 40,000 and 80,000 deaths per year.9 These troubling findings make developing effective methods to prevent diagnostic errors an urgent priority.

There are debates about whether the returns generated from the sales of medicines, including cancer medicines, are sufficient for pharmaceutical companies to cover their past R&amp;D expenses, maintain their operations and engage in future drug discovery research. For example, some commentators have observed that the revenue generated from the sales of imatinib had exceeded the costs of R&amp;D within two years and “the revenues over the subsequent years of the patent would represent generous profits to the company” (30). Another study found that total revenue from the sales of 10 cancer medicines since approval over a median of four years (US$ 67.0 billion) was 9.3 times the total R&amp;D spending of US$ 7.2 billion (or 7.4 times using an estimated risk-adjusted R&amp;D costs of US$ 9.1 billion) (94).

receptor antagonist that affects the autonomic nervous system and reduces cardiovascular symptoms (e.g., tachycardia and hypertension) resulting from epinephrine in the circulation. Beta blockers interfere with receptor binding by catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine, of which epinephrine is the principal catecholamine affecting the cardiovascular symptoms. Propranolol is a lipophilic beta blocker that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, it can affect both somatic and CNS target tissues.

Phase 1. The aim of Phase 1 was to identify the contributions of clinical and laboratory variables that in practice were the most predictive of the decision to initiate DMARD therapy in a population of patients with early undifferentiated synovitis. Initiation of DMARD therapy was used as an indicator of the physician’s opinion that the patient was at risk of developing persistent and/or erosive arthritis that we would currently consider to be RA. Data on 3,115 patients from 9 early arthritis cohorts who were consid- ered not to have evidence of another possible diagnosis explaining their presentation were obtained. Between July 2007 and November 2008 an expert working group developed an analysis strategy that related an agreed- upon list of standardized clinical and laboratory vari- ables collected at baseline to the initiation of DMARD treatment within the next 12 months. MTX initiation was used as the gold standard for this purpose. The analytical process aimed to identify the independent contribution of each variable on this list and included univariate regression modeling, a subsequent principal components analysis, and a multivariate regression model that included all identified components (25). The resulting list of informative variables identified during that process and the weights based on the odds ratios are shown in Table 1. Phase 2. Phase 2 consisted of a consensus-based, decision science–informed approach, which took place between November 2008 and June 2009. The purpose of this phase was to derive a clinician-based judgment on
There are many, often complicated, mechanisms of efflorescence. Simply stated, efflorescence occurs when water containing dissolved salts is brought to the surface of masonry, the water evaporates and the salts are left on the surface of the masonry. The salt solutions may migrate across surfaces of masonry units, between the mortar and units, or through the pores of the mortar or units.

• Fatigue and sleepiness. Feelings of fatigue (low energy, physical tiredness, weariness) are more common than symptoms of sleepiness (actual tendency to fall asleep) in patients with chronic insomnia. The presence of significant sleepiness should prompt a search for other potential sleep disorders. The number, duration, and timing of naps should be thoroughly investigated, as both a consequence of in- somnia and a potential contributing factor.

The TSST method has been used to study the effects of oral propranolol in volunteer subjects [25-28]. The assessments of psychic anxiety can be assessed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) or other similar tools [29,30]. The somatic and psychic effects of oral propranolol were tested using the TSST method in healthy adult volunteers. Propranolol (40 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, reduced systolic blood pressure, and enhanced cognitive flexibility during stress. In another study propranolol (80 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, but paradoxically increased salivary cortisol, and did not significantly affect BP or subjective stress [25]. But, in another TSST study daily oral propranolol (80 mg) did not affect the salivary cortisol response [27].

The interventions/exposures are allocated under the main headings and subheadings listed in Appendix 4. For example, diet modifications –e.g. diets rich in fruit and vegetables and low in fats- will be coded under “Dietary patterns” and combinations of micronutrients in supplements will be coded under “Dietary Constituents”.
In summary, public and non-profit-making sectors, and by extension tax-payers and philanthropists, have provided considerable financial and non-financial contributions towards the R&amp;D of cancer medicines. This means that in many cases, pharmaceutical companies have not incurred the full costs of R&amp;D. The pharmaceutical industry has also benefited greatly from the knowledge generated by public-sector investments in R&amp;D, and by having access to research supported by public funding at costs, if any, lower than the market value.

a physician intentionally stimulates a physiologic response by CO 2 inhalation [31], sodium lactate infusion [32,33], or cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4) injection [32,34]. These chemical exposures are used as potent tools to design controlled studies with predictable levels of PA episodes. In a study with healthy volunteer subjects using carbon dioxide inhalation to provoke panic and anxiety, propranolol significantly decreased heart rate, a cardiovascular somatic symptom, but did not provide psychic anxiolytic benefit [35].

Building on Failures Researchers continue on their search for effective new treatments for the more than 120 forms of brain cancer, but they face great challenges.93 Since 1998, there have only been 3 new drug approvals for brain cancer, while another 75 medicines have failed in the development process having been discontinued, suspended, or had no development reported.94 That is a 25:1 ratio of unsuccessful attempts to FDA-approved medicines. Decades of research have provided limited treatment options for patients facing aggressive, late-stage forms of brain cancer. Although challenges persist, researchers continue to use past setbacks to inform future discoveries in brain cancer therapies.

The prevailing models of emergency medical transport used in North America and Western Europe are quite costly and would be impractical for most low-income countries. Severe resource constraints, the poor condition of roads or trails, and a lack of fuel may dictate the utilization of a wider range of options. In the United Republic of Tanzania, for example, modes of emergency transportation include motor- boats, canoes, bicycles with trailers, tricycles with platforms, tractors with trailers, reconditioned vehicles, and ox carts (22).

The statewide assessments in mathematics, reading, and science are used to measure whether students, and their school and district, are meeting the academic standards. Statewide assessments are one measure of how well students are doing on the content that is part of their daily instruction. It is also a measure of how well schools and districts are doing in aligning their curriculum and teaching the standards.

Phase 1. The aim of Phase 1 was to identify the contributions of clinical and laboratory variables that in practice were the most predictive of the decision to initiate DMARD therapy in a population of patients with early undifferentiated synovitis. Initiation of DMARD therapy was used as an indicator of the physician’s opinion that the patient was at risk of developing persistent and/or erosive arthritis that we would currently consider to be RA. Data on 3,115 patients from 9 early arthritis cohorts who were consid- ered not to have evidence of another possible diagnosis explaining their presentation were obtained. Between July 2007 and November 2008 an expert working group developed an analysis strategy that related an agreed- upon list of standardized clinical and laboratory vari- ables collected at baseline to the initiation of DMARD treatment within the next 12 months. MTX initiation was used as the gold standard for this purpose. The analytical process aimed to identify the independent contribution of each variable on this list and included univariate regression modeling, a subsequent principal components analysis, and a multivariate regression model that included all identified components (25). The resulting list of informative variables identified during that process and the weights based on the odds ratios are shown in Table 1. Phase 2. Phase 2 consisted of a consensus-based, decision science–informed approach, which took place between November 2008 and June 2009. The purpose of this phase was to derive a clinician-based judgment on

O ceratocone, a degeneração marginal pelúcida e ectasia pós-cirurgia refrativa são doenças que causam afilamento e abaulamento da córnea (estrutura transparente que forma a parede anterior do globo ocular). Estas alterações provocam astigmatismo irregular com distorção visual importante. O grau de embaçamento visual vai depender do grau de astigmatismo produzido e da existência de outras alterações oculares associadas. Astigmatismo pós-transplante de córnea é um grau residual que ocorre dependendo da intera- ção entre córnea doada e receptor (coaptação, cicatrização, abertura e frouxidão de pontos no decorrer da cicatrização e sua retirada).

President Obama has recently expressed a strong conviction that “Science offers great potential for improving health”. The President has announced a research initiative that aims to accelerate progress toward a new era of precision medicine. The time is accurate for this idealistic initiative, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other partners will work to attain this vision [7]. The concept of precision medicine speaks of prevention and treatment strategies that take individual variability into account. Even though it is not new, the impact of practicality is still deprived. If one considers blood typing, for instance, has been used to guide blood transfusions for more than a century. But the vision of applying this concept broadly has been intensely improved by the latest development of large-scale biologic databases (such as the human genome sequence), powerful methods for typifying patients (such as proteomics, metabolomics, genomics, diverse cellular assays, and even mobile health technology), and computational tools for analyzing large sets of data. Francis S.Collins et al. stated that, “What is necessary now is a broad

In the late 1800s, Andrew Taylor Still identified the neuromusculoskeletal system as the key element in health maintenance and stressed preventive aspects of medi- cine in place of drug therapy. During that time, osteop- athy was truly separate and distinct from the world of allo- pathic medicine. Since then, as medicine in general has become more evidence-based and supported by research, osteopathic philosophy has evolved into a more complete and robust osteopathic medicine. The phrase “osteopathic medicine” is now the accepted term for the profession over “osteopathy,” a now-antiquated term that represents a period when Still championed a near-drugless form of manual medicine. Since its conception, osteopathic med- icine has adapted its body of knowledge to incorporate contemporary scientific thought, including germ theory, pharmacology, and other “allopathic” teachings. The cen- tral tenets of osteopathic thought, however, have been maintained and continue to guide DOs in their practice of medicine. Though interprofessional relations between MDs and DOs are better than they have ever been before, challenges still exist in terms of keeping the osteopathic tradition intact, improving the evidence basis of OMM via clinical research, and advocating for widespread recogni- tion of DOs.

Recent analyses of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)- Medicare database tracked healthcare use and costs (projected to 2004 levels) from diagnosis and initial treatment [ 15 ] , in addition to a 4-year follow-up [ 17 ] , for a cohort of 81 659 elderly patients with prostate cancer who had Medicare claims from 1991 to 2003 [ 15 ] , and 1991 to 2004 [ 17 ] , respectively. Treatment in the fi rst year after diagnosis was calculated to incur costs of $21 040 per patient; $13 091 for prostate cancer-related costs and $7949 for medical costs unrelated to prostate cancer [ 15 ] . In terms of cost at each stage, as expected, there was an increase in costs from stage I to IV [ 15,17 ] . Prostate cancer-related costs over 4 years from diagnosis averaged $18 168 per patient [ 17 ] . The annual healthcare cost burden estimated in 2009 is &gt; $2.5 billion annually for initial care alone [ 17 ] .

Dose ranging test: Here, compounds are tested at a minimum of 4 different doses (the “dose ranging, full 4-day test”, typically 100, 30, 10 and 3 mg/kg, by both s.c. and p.o. routes of administration). ED 50 and ED 90 values are calculated by plotting the log dose against probit activity (for example, using Microcal “Origin”). These reflect the drug concentrations at which 50% and 90% of suppression of parasitemia is achieved. Note that with short half-life drugs it may be necessary to dose multiple times per day. Two other parameters measured in this study are relative potency compared to an appropriate standard drug, and oral bioavailability (assessed by comparison of oral and parenteral administration).

Numerous alternative beta blockers are available in lieu of propranolol. Notable among these is the common drug, atenolol, that is available in oral solid dose forms ranging from 25 to 100 mg for the treatment of hypertension. Multiple doses per day may be permitted. It has been used to suppress stage fright in performers when administered orally in advance [45]. Atenolol is a beta-1 selective peripheral-acting agent without CNS effects, which should reduce the risk for asthmatic subjects [46]. Thus, atenolol might be preferred over the nonselective beta blockers for patients affected by asthma or COPD [47]. Oral atenolol at 50 - 200 mg doses suppressed heart rate by ~ 23 - 24 beats per minute (bpm) vs. ~ 10 bpm on placebo [46]. Also,

The goals of treatment are to “cure” the cancer, if possible; pro- long survival; and provide the highest possible quality of life during and after treatment. A cancer is cured when all traces of the cancer have been removed from the patient’s body. Although it is usually not possible to know if the cancer is completely eradicated, for many patients, the initial course of therapy is successful and the cancer never returns. However, some cancer- free survivors must cope with the long-term effects of treatment, as well as psychological concerns such as fear of recurrence. Cancer patients, caregivers, and survivors must have the infor- mation and support they need to play an active role in decisions that affect treatment and quality of life.

Sport-specific rules may not allow adequate time for evaluation, and modifying these rules remains an area for improvement within the governing bodies of some sports. (C) When the sports medicine clinician becomes aware of a poten- tial injury, the athlete is approached and a brief history of the event is obtained from the athlete and those who witnessed the event or athlete behaviour. How the athlete responds to the elements of orientation, memory, concentration and balance is evaluated, as well as speech patterns and how the athlete appears to be processing information. Cervical palpation and range of motion (ROM) are also typically performed to assess for other

In addition to return to learning and sporting environments, older athletes may need to return to driving, where subtle defi- cits could compromise safety. Most sports medicine physicians do not counsel athletes with SRC about driving.90 Driving is a complex process involving coordination of cognitive, visual and motor skills, as well as concentration, attention, visual percep- tion, insight and memory, which can all be affected by SRC.90 Little is known about the risk of driving after SRC, but prelim- inary data suggest some impairment exists when patients with concussion report they are asymptomatic.91 Currently, no widely

These assignment guidelines pertain exclusively to Commercial Mobile Radio Service providers (CMRS). The IMSI Administrator directly administers only the Home Network Identity (HNI) segment of the resource. The HNI uniquely identifies the home wireless network of a FCC- licensed two-way CMRS subscriber and contains the Mobile Country Code (MCC) and the Mobile Network Code (MNC). The remaining segment of the IMSI, the Mobile Station Identification Number (MSIN), is directly administered by the wireless network licensee to which the HNI is assigned. Issue: In 1998, ITU Recommendation E.212 was modified allowing IMSI assignments to those Wireline Service Providers offering limited mobility services. As a result, HNI assignments are no longer available exclusively to CMRS providers. The current IMSI assignment and administrative guidelines do not however reflect these modifications.

changes in clinical status. Reassessments might be per- formed less frequently for patients with more stable pain (eg, patients who have exhibited good pain con- trol without side effects after 24 hours of stable ther- apy). Pain reassessments might be useful at the time of nursing shift changes or with new caregivers to establish a baseline and promote continuity of care, although evidence showing that routine reassessment of pain at nursing shift changes is associated with improved clinical outcomes is not available.
In summary, public and non-profit-making sectors, and by extension tax-payers and philanthropists, have provided considerable financial and non-financial contributions towards the R&amp;D of cancer medicines. This means that in many cases, pharmaceutical companies have not incurred the full costs of R&amp;D. The pharmaceutical industry has also benefited greatly from the knowledge generated by public-sector investments in R&amp;D, and by having access to research supported by public funding at costs, if any, lower than the market value.

Wind turbines will be used to harness the kinetic energy of the moving air over the oceans on the OCS and convert it to electricity. Offshore winds are less turbulent (because the ocean is flat relative to onshore topography), and they tend to flow at higher speeds than onshore winds, thus allowing turbines to produce more electricity. Because the potential energy produced from the wind is directly proportional to the cube of the wind speed, increased wind speeds of only a few miles per hour can produce a significantly larger amount of electricity. For instance, a turbine at a site with an average wind speed of 16 mph would produce 50% more electricity than at a site with the same turbine and average wind speeds of 14 mph (Offshore Wind 2006).

samples)) / (geometric mean cpm of no drug samples). Percentage reductions are used to plot percentage inhibition of growth as a function of drug concentrations. IC 50 values are determined by linear regression analyses on the linear segments of the curves (IC 90 values can also be determined by curve-fitting and can provide an useful measure of variation between experiments). Assays are typically repeated on two or three separate occasions. Within each experiment, standard deviations are typically less than 10% of the mean. Differences in parasite stages of development can lead to up to two-fold shifts in the IC 50 values between experiments; however, these differences rarely affect the overall relationships between the parasite lines in terms of their differences in drug response 4-11 .

President Obama has recently expressed a strong conviction that “Science offers great potential for improving health”. The President has announced a research initiative that aims to accelerate progress toward a new era of precision medicine. The time is accurate for this idealistic initiative, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other partners will work to attain this vision [7]. The concept of precision medicine speaks of prevention and treatment strategies that take individual variability into account. Even though it is not new, the impact of practicality is still deprived. If one considers blood typing, for instance, has been used to guide blood transfusions for more than a century. But the vision of applying this concept broadly has been intensely improved by the latest development of large-scale biologic databases (such as the human genome sequence), powerful methods for typifying patients (such as proteomics, metabolomics, genomics, diverse cellular assays, and even mobile health technology), and computational tools for analyzing large sets of data. Francis S.Collins et al. stated that, “What is necessary now is a broad
Results from the tests showed that the average value of critical thinking ability to the average achievement after the testing ended, showed the relationship was statistically significant (.05). As a result, the researchers compared the results of Table 4 and determined that after the posttest, data showed the average of critical thinking ability and post-learning achievement were higher than before the study.

Sleep-inducing drugs (hypnotics) are medications specif- ically designed to induce sleepiness directly after intake. Optimal agents affect cognitive performance during this period while inducing minimal sleepiness in the waking day after use. An optimal hypnotic would have low tox- icity and addictive potential, as well a minimal side effect profile (Oswald 1970). Among the first hypnotics, and an agent still in use is chloral hydrate - the original “Mickey Finn” - slipped into the drinks of unsuspecting marks for the purposes of criminal activity. Unfortu- nately, this medication is difficult to use since the LD-50 (potentially fatal dose) is quite close to the therapeutic dose. In the years leading up to the 1970’s, rapidly acting barbiturates were commonly utilized for their hypnotic effects. Unfortunately, these medications, also drugs of abuse, had a significant danger of overdose and contrib- uted to an era that was characterized in part by deaths due to overdoses of sleeping pills. These medications and similar barbiturate-like medications [Methaqualone (Quaalude, Sopor) Glutethimide (Doriden), Ethchlor- vynol (Placidyl), Methyprylon (Nodudar)] have limited availability and are rarely used due to limited efficacy, cognitive effects, the potential for abuse and lethal tox- icity associated with overdose (Oswald 1970). Today their primary therapeutic uses include executions and fa- cilitated euthanasia (Lossignol 2008). Most currently utilized hypnotics affect the widely dis- persed negative neurotransmitter GABA. In the 1970’s benzodiazepines (GABA agonists) were first marketed as hypnotics. Some of these agents had an extremely short duration of action [Triazolam (Halcion)]. While this agent-induced minimal next day somnolence, use was as- sociated with daytime memory impairment, particularly at higher dosages (Roehrs et al. 2000; Adam and Oswald

We report the results for four experiments in this pa- per: i) the results of using the IDF stoplist over a ba- sic stoplist, ii) the results of our approach using dif- ferent context descriptions of the possible concepts of a target word, iii) the results of our approach com- pared to SenseClusters and Humphrey et al. (2006) using the NLM-WSD dataset, and iv) the results of our approach compared to SenseClusters using the con(cid:3)ated dataset. The results of using an individualized IDF stoplist for each target word show an improvement over us- ing the basic stoplist. The results of our approach using different context descriptions show that for the NLM-WSD dataset the large differences in accuracy makes it unclear which of the context descriptions performed the best. On the con(cid:3)ated dataset, adding the ST de(cid:2)nition to the context description improved

In the future, we would also like to increase the size of our con(cid:3)ated dataset and possibly create a biomedical all-words disambiguation test set to test our approach. Unlike SenseClusters, our approach can be used to perform all-words disambiguation. For example, given the sentence: His weight has fluctuated during the past month. We (cid:2)rst create a instance vector containing fluctuated, past and months for the word weight and a concept vector for each of its possible concepts, (cid:147)C0005912: Body Weight(cid:148) and (cid:147)C0699807: Quantitative Concept(cid:148) us- ing their context descriptions. We then calculate the cosine between the instance vector and each of the two concept vectors. The concept whose vector has the smallest cosine score is assigned to weight. We then repeat this process for fluctuated, past and months. We also plan to explore using different contex- tual information to improve the accuracy of our approach. We are currently exploring using co- occurrence and relational information about the pos- sible CUIs in the UMLS. Our IDF stoplist exper-

Of note, mice under single or combined metformin treatments showed an extended survival, whereas 84% of the nontreat- ed mice succumbed within 1 week after infection (Table 1). In conclusion, metformin treatment in combi- nation with suboptimal dosage of conventional antimalarials is more efficacious in reducing parasite load.

d Stage success rate of 60% for combining two medicines has been added into reflect the potential for unfavourable drug–drug interactions that prevents further development of a combination. However, as discussed in the text, this may be an underestimate, since it does not include additional risk because of the change in endpoints between parasite reduction in phase IIa (APCR on day 14 or 28) and ACPR day 28 in phase IIb. No additional allowance has been made for the risk that a medicine may fail because it is not possible to produce a pediatric presentation
The use of two antimalarials simultaneously, especially when the antimalarials have different mechanisms of action, has the potential for inhib- iting the development of resistance to either of the components. The efficacy of a combination of a 4-aminoquinoline drug (either chloroquine or amo- diaquine) with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine has been reviewed (43). The results of this review sug- gested that the addition of either chloroquine or amodiaquine to SP marginally improved parasitological clearance (compared with SP alone). The studies reviewed were mostly done in areas and at times when both SP and chloroquine/amodi- aquine retained a fair amount of efficacy, and it is not clear from these studies how well such a combination would act in areas where one of the components was significantly compromised. Additionally, to date, there are no data to suggest whether this slightly improved clearance would

Reflecting – reconsidering a topic by taking into account new information or a new experience, or considering other viewpoints. 3. Analyzing – examining and then explaining how something is, including comparing and contrasting different elements and understanding relationships to your subject/topic. 4. Critiquing – identifying and examining weaknesses in arguments, as well as acknowledging its strengths. It’s important to think of critiquing as ‘neutral’ and not negative. 5. Reasoning – using methods such as cause and effect to demonstrate logical thinking, as well as presenting evidence that either refutes or proves an argument.

Minnesota Statutes, section 120B.31, subdivision 4a, requires the commissioner to create and publish a form for parents and guardians to complete if they refuse to have their student participate in state-required standardized assessments. Your student’s district may require additional information. School districts must post this three-page form on the district website and include it in district student handbooks.
Many complicated and expensive techniques have been applied extensively in literature to extract relationships and dependencies from data. These techniques generally rely on a deep parse results that gives a rich representation which is used for applications in knowledge extraction and semantics. The problem with biomedical data parsing is that there is no exhaustive tagged training corpus available to build models for efficient parsing on test data. Also, deep parsing is computationally very expensive compared to shallow parsing that uses the finite state automaton techniques. UMLS graciously provides such a shallow parser[7] that is trained on entire Medline corpus and claims to achieve over 97% accuracy.
Researchers spend a great deal of time reading research pa- pers. However, this skill is rarely taught, leading to much wasted effort. This article outlines a practical and efficient three-pass method for reading research papers. I also de- scribe how to use this method to do a literature survey.

In this paper, we describe a novel feature space designed to effectively classify the polarity and strength of relationships extracted from biomedical abstracts. In addition to the conventional syntactic features such as unigrams and bigrams, we have also explored and constructed semantics-based sequential features. These features are constructed at three different levels: entity, phrase, and sentence. A wrapper-based method is then used to select the optimal feature sets for both polarity and strength prediction. Specifically, a multi-stage SVM classifier and an SVR predictor are built for polarity and strength prediction, respectively. Two different schemas, namely, (1 vs. all) and (2 vs. 2), are employed to build the multi-stage SVM. Finally, three different kernel functions are considered at different stage of this SVM classifier. Our intensive evaluations have shown that for polarity prediction, the (2 vs. 2) schema in general works better than the (1 vs. all). It produces the highest polarity accuracy of 0.91 when both unigrams and semantics-based sequential structures (KSS) are used, with a standard error ranging between 0.01~0.02. On the other hand, we find that for strength prediction, unigrams solely can produce satisfying results. We obtain a high accuracy of 0.96, with the standard error ranging between 0.61%~0.63% for the strength analysis. We are currently expanding our annotated corpus to facilitate further validation of the findings reported in this work. We are also integrating this module with other modules as shown in Figure 1 towards building a quantitative food-disease-gene network. Finally, we are creating an interactive user interface to visually present this network.

• Mood disturbances and cognitive difficulties. Complaints of irritability, loss of interest, mild depression and anxi- ety are common among insomnia patients. Patients with chronic insomnia often complain of mental inefficiency, difficulty remembering, difficulty focusing attention, and difficulty with complex mental tasks. • Quality of life: The irritability and fatigue associated with insomnia may cause interpersonal difficulties for insomnia patients, or avoidance of such activities. Conversely, in- terpersonal difficulties may be an important contributor to insomnia problems for some individuals. Sleep and wak- ing problems may lead to restriction of daytime activities, including social events, exercise, or work. Lack of regular daytime activities and exercise may in turn contribute to insomnia. • Exacerbation of comorbid conditions. Comorbid condi- tions may cause or increase sleep difficulties. Likewise, poor sleep may exacerbate symptomatology of comorbid conditions. Sleep complaints may herald the onset of mood disorders or exacerbation of comorbid conditions. VI. Other History: A complete insomnia history also in- cludes medical, psychiatric, medication/substance, and family/ social/occupational histories. A wide range of medical (Table 5) and psychiatric (Table 6) conditions can be comorbid with

The strength and moisture penetration resistance of a brick masonry cavity wall are affected by the mortar selection and compatibility with the brick units. Portland cement-lime, mortar cement, or masonry cement mortars can be used. However, mortars with an air content less than 12 percent are recommended for their superior bond strength and resistance to moisture penetration. The MSJC Code requires that the allowable flexural tensile stresses be reduced by approximately 50 percent for assemblies constructed with masonry cement mortars or portland cement-lime mortars that have air entrainment. In addition, some building codes prohibit the use of masonry cement mortars and all Type N mortars in Seismic Performance Categories D and E (formerly Seismic Zones 3 and 4). Mortar should meet the proportion requirements of ASTM C 270 Specification for Mortar for Unit Masonry as shown in Table 1. Mortar type selection should be based on project requirements, such as strength and compatibility with a particular brick unit. Types N or S mortars are typically used in brick masonry cavity walls. See Technical Notes 8 Series for more detailed information on mortar types and selection.

Results from the tests showed that the average value of critical thinking ability to the average achievement after the testing ended, showed the relationship was statistically significant (.05). As a result, the researchers compared the results of Table 4 and determined that after the posttest, data showed the average of critical thinking ability and post-learning achievement were higher than before the study.
While many of these symptoms can be seen with other conditions such as allergies, we ask that you seek medical evaluation if you identify any of these symptoms. Loss of taste or smell is very specific to COVID‐19 and may be described as food tasting bland, rather than not being able to taste. If your child develops any of these symptoms, please notify your child’s school, contact your child’s doctor for evaluation/testing, and keep your child home from school.

The TSST method has been used to study the effects of oral propranolol in volunteer subjects [25-28]. The assessments of psychic anxiety can be assessed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) or other similar tools [29,30]. The somatic and psychic effects of oral propranolol were tested using the TSST method in healthy adult volunteers. Propranolol (40 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, reduced systolic blood pressure, and enhanced cognitive flexibility during stress. In another study propranolol (80 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, but paradoxically increased salivary cortisol, and did not significantly affect BP or subjective stress [25]. But, in another TSST study daily oral propranolol (80 mg) did not affect the salivary cortisol response [27].

medicine when following up n candidate molecules. The numerical solutions for this equation show that at least 48 molecules are to be evaluated for this probability to exceed 90%. The MMV discovery portfolio was built and funded to deliver two new preclinical candidates per year, and allowing for a third molecule coming from else- where, then this would still require some 16 years’ invest- ment per combination, except if there is a considerable increase in success rates going forwards (and a justifica- tion for this), or significantly increased investment. The hope on the horizon is that many of the new molecules are first-in-class, and so should they fail in clinical devel- opment there will be scope for well-defined back-up pro- jects, and these are normally much more cost-effective programmes. The definition of new molecular targets also opens up new possibilities for engaging the wider research community, allowing access to resources such as the EU’s European Lead Factory, which considers molec- ular targets but not phenotypic approaches.

The inclusion of SPX Weeklys in the VIX Index calculation means that the near-term options will always have more than 23 days to expiration and the next-term options always have less than 37 days to expiration, so the resulting VIX Index value will always reflect an interpolation of σ2 1 and σ2 2 ; i.e., each individual weight is less than or equal to 1 and the sum of the weights equals 1.

The numbers in each block are codes for the treatment given to each animal. The purpose of such a design is to reduce heterogeneity associated with time, space and some physical varia- tion. The five animals in Block 1 would be chosen to be as similar as possible with respect to age, weight, genotype and any other variable which might influence the outcome. They would then be assigned at random to one of the five treatments. The animals would be housed in close proximity, and possibly even in the same cage, if the different treatments can be given in such a situation. When measurements are to be made on the animals, those in Block 1 would be treated as a group, with all measurements being made within a short period by the same per- son. Animals in the other blocks would likewise be selected to be as uniform as possible, but might differ in body weight or age, etc. from those in Block 1. They could be measured at a dif- ferent time, if necessary by a different person. Thus, within each block any comparison among treatments would be made on animals which are in all possible ways as similar as possible. The unwanted variation shows up as differences between blocks. This is then removed mathe- matically in the statistical analysis.

With some variation over time and across cancer types, care for the cancer population involves the six categories of services analyzed. The bars in Figures 2a-2c indicate that some patients had significant use of facility services in the year preceding the cancer diagnosis. For both colorectal and lung cancers, total spending on hospital inpatient increased as a percentage of total immediately following diagnosis. In all three cancers, the chemotherapy share of total spending increased rapidly in the first few months after diagnosis and, with the exception of breast cancer, continued at a fairly consistent level of around 20% of spending in subsequent years.

The increase in full-text downloads for open access articles during their first year after publication suggests that the primary benefit to the nonsubscriber commu- nity is in browsing, as opposed to printing or saving, which would have been indicated by a commensurate increase in PDF downloads. The decrease in abstract views suggests a reader preference for the full docu- ment when available.

The prevailing models of emergency medical transport used in North America and Western Europe are quite costly and would be impractical for most low-income countries. Severe resource constraints, the poor condition of roads or trails, and a lack of fuel may dictate the utilization of a wider range of options. In the United Republic of Tanzania, for example, modes of emergency transportation include motor- boats, canoes, bicycles with trailers, tricycles with platforms, tractors with trailers, reconditioned vehicles, and ox carts (22).

• Mood disturbances and cognitive difficulties. Complaints of irritability, loss of interest, mild depression and anxi- ety are common among insomnia patients. Patients with chronic insomnia often complain of mental inefficiency, difficulty remembering, difficulty focusing attention, and difficulty with complex mental tasks. • Quality of life: The irritability and fatigue associated with insomnia may cause interpersonal difficulties for insomnia patients, or avoidance of such activities. Conversely, in- terpersonal difficulties may be an important contributor to insomnia problems for some individuals. Sleep and wak- ing problems may lead to restriction of daytime activities, including social events, exercise, or work. Lack of regular daytime activities and exercise may in turn contribute to insomnia. • Exacerbation of comorbid conditions. Comorbid condi- tions may cause or increase sleep difficulties. Likewise, poor sleep may exacerbate symptomatology of comorbid conditions. Sleep complaints may herald the onset of mood disorders or exacerbation of comorbid conditions. VI. Other History: A complete insomnia history also in- cludes medical, psychiatric, medication/substance, and family/ social/occupational histories. A wide range of medical (Table 5) and psychiatric (Table 6) conditions can be comorbid with

changes in clinical status. Reassessments might be per- formed less frequently for patients with more stable pain (eg, patients who have exhibited good pain con- trol without side effects after 24 hours of stable ther- apy). Pain reassessments might be useful at the time of nursing shift changes or with new caregivers to establish a baseline and promote continuity of care, although evidence showing that routine reassessment of pain at nursing shift changes is associated with improved clinical outcomes is not available.

ability to sleep and the daytime consequences of poor sleep, dis- torted beliefs and attitudes about the origins and meaning of the insomnia, maladaptive efforts to accommodate to the condition (e.g., schedule or lifestyle changes), and excessive time spent awake in bed. The latter behavior is of particular significance in that it often is associated with “trying hard” to fall asleep and growing frustration and tension in the face of wakefulness. Thus, the bed becomes associated with a state of waking arousal as this conditioning paradigm repeats itself night after night.

•Representante Legal: É aquele que por lei ou declaração judicial está autorizado a contrair direitos e obrigações em nome de um terceiro. De acordo com o Código Civil Brasileiro Art. 1.690, compete aos pais, e na falta de um deles ao outro, com exclusividade, representar os filhos menores de dezesseis anos, bem como assis�-los até a maioridade (com o falecimento dos pais, ou sendo estes julgados ausentes, ou em caso de os pais decaírem do poder familiar, compe�rá ao tutor legal representar o menor até os dezesseis anos e assis�-lo após essa idade - Código Civil Brasileiro Art. 1.747). Dessa maneira, no caso de um paciente menor, caso este seja menor de 16 anos, apenas o representante deverá assinar este termo (“representação”). Já, caso o paciente seja maior de 16 e menor de 18, tanto o representante legal, quanto o paciente, deverão assinar este termo (“assistência”).

medically related text and metadata features, such as “pa- tients,” “alzheimer,” “health information management,” and “medicine” are also important and of mostly positive polar- ity, since medical articles attract greater news coverage than, say, a recently published computer science paper. As we dis- cuss later, the presence of “alzheimer” as an important, neg- ative feature is more an artifact of the dataset than an iden- tification of trends in popularity. We also find an artifact of year (2016) of the dataset with the feature “zika virus,” due to the 2015-2016 zika epidemic in North and South Amer- ica.

The goals of treatment are to “cure” the cancer, if possible; pro- long survival; and provide the highest possible quality of life during and after treatment. A cancer is cured when all traces of the cancer have been removed from the patient’s body. Although it is usually not possible to know if the cancer is completely eradicated, for many patients, the initial course of therapy is successful and the cancer never returns. However, some cancer- free survivors must cope with the long-term effects of treatment, as well as psychological concerns such as fear of recurrence. Cancer patients, caregivers, and survivors must have the infor- mation and support they need to play an active role in decisions that affect treatment and quality of life.

When analyzing the data, we found that there does not exist a CUI de(cid:2)nition for a large number of pos- sible concepts. Table 5 shows the number of words in the CUI and ST de(cid:2)nitions for each concept in the NLM-WSD dataset. Only four target words have a CUI de(cid:2)nition for each possible concept. We also found the concept de(cid:2)nitions vary widely in length. The CUI de(cid:2)nitions in the UMLS come from a va- riety of sources and there may exist more than one de(cid:2)nition per source. Unlike CUI de(cid:2)nitions, there does exist an ST de(cid:2)nition for each possible con- cept. The ST de(cid:2)nitions come from the same source and are approximately the same length but they are a broad categorization. We believe this makes them too coarse grained to provide descriptive enough in- formation about their associated concepts.

Readership analysis was conducted on the 20 science journals in our data set (n(cid:1)2903). Articles published in the social sciences and humanities journals (n(cid:1)350) were omitted from the readership analysis, as many did not include abstract or full-text versions of their articles, and, in some cases, refer- ence views were added to full-text views, resulting in indeter- minate and incomparable results. Citation analyses were conducted on the entire article data set (n(cid:1)3245). A logistic regression model was used to estimate the likelihood of articles in each experimental group being cited within the first year after publication, controlling for journal and journal category effects.

a physician intentionally stimulates a physiologic response by CO 2 inhalation [31], sodium lactate infusion [32,33], or cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4) injection [32,34]. These chemical exposures are used as potent tools to design controlled studies with predictable levels of PA episodes. In a study with healthy volunteer subjects using carbon dioxide inhalation to provoke panic and anxiety, propranolol significantly decreased heart rate, a cardiovascular somatic symptom, but did not provide psychic anxiolytic benefit [35].

Insomnia occurs in individuals of all ages and races, and has been observed across all cultures and countries.8,9 The actual prevalence of insomnia varies according to the stringency of the definition used. Insomnia symptoms occur in approximately 33% to 50% of the adult population; insomnia symptoms with dis- tress or impairment (i.e., general insomnia disorder) in 10% to 15%; and specific insomnia disorders in 5% to 10%.10 Consis- tent risk factors for insomnia include increasing age, female sex, comorbid (medical, psychiatric, sleep, and substance use) disor- ders, shift work, and possibly unemployment and lower socio- economic status. Patients with comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions are at particularly increased risk, with psychiatric and chronic pain disorders having insomnia rates as high as 50% to 75%.11-13 The risk relationship between insomnia and psychiatric disorders appears to be bidirectional; several studies have also

6. Identify the efflorescence. Knowing the composition of efflorescing salts is sometimes of use. Table 1, taken from Brownell’s report lists the most probable sources of efflorescing salts. Commercial testing laboratories can use X-ray diffraction, petrographic analysis or chemical analysis can, in some instances, determine both the type of salts present and their relative quantity. 7. Consider miscellaneous sources of water when all obvious sources have been eliminated. Some of these sources are: condensation within the wall, poorly directed landscape sprinklers, leaky pipes, faulty drains and condensation on heating or plumbing pipes. If necessary, condensation analysis methods are described in Technical Note 47.

The numbers in each block are codes for the treatment given to each animal. The purpose of such a design is to reduce heterogeneity associated with time, space and some physical varia- tion. The five animals in Block 1 would be chosen to be as similar as possible with respect to age, weight, genotype and any other variable which might influence the outcome. They would then be assigned at random to one of the five treatments. The animals would be housed in close proximity, and possibly even in the same cage, if the different treatments can be given in such a situation. When measurements are to be made on the animals, those in Block 1 would be treated as a group, with all measurements being made within a short period by the same per- son. Animals in the other blocks would likewise be selected to be as uniform as possible, but might differ in body weight or age, etc. from those in Block 1. They could be measured at a dif- ferent time, if necessary by a different person. Thus, within each block any comparison among treatments would be made on animals which are in all possible ways as similar as possible. The unwanted variation shows up as differences between blocks. This is then removed mathe- matically in the statistical analysis.

• Mood disturbances and cognitive difficulties. Complaints of irritability, loss of interest, mild depression and anxi- ety are common among insomnia patients. Patients with chronic insomnia often complain of mental inefficiency, difficulty remembering, difficulty focusing attention, and difficulty with complex mental tasks. • Quality of life: The irritability and fatigue associated with insomnia may cause interpersonal difficulties for insomnia patients, or avoidance of such activities. Conversely, in- terpersonal difficulties may be an important contributor to insomnia problems for some individuals. Sleep and wak- ing problems may lead to restriction of daytime activities, including social events, exercise, or work. Lack of regular daytime activities and exercise may in turn contribute to insomnia. • Exacerbation of comorbid conditions. Comorbid condi- tions may cause or increase sleep difficulties. Likewise, poor sleep may exacerbate symptomatology of comorbid conditions. Sleep complaints may herald the onset of mood disorders or exacerbation of comorbid conditions. VI. Other History: A complete insomnia history also in- cludes medical, psychiatric, medication/substance, and family/ social/occupational histories. A wide range of medical (Table 5) and psychiatric (Table 6) conditions can be comorbid with

medicine when following up n candidate molecules. The numerical solutions for this equation show that at least 48 molecules are to be evaluated for this probability to exceed 90%. The MMV discovery portfolio was built and funded to deliver two new preclinical candidates per year, and allowing for a third molecule coming from else- where, then this would still require some 16 years’ invest- ment per combination, except if there is a considerable increase in success rates going forwards (and a justifica- tion for this), or significantly increased investment. The hope on the horizon is that many of the new molecules are first-in-class, and so should they fail in clinical devel- opment there will be scope for well-defined back-up pro- jects, and these are normally much more cost-effective programmes. The definition of new molecular targets also opens up new possibilities for engaging the wider research community, allowing access to resources such as the EU’s European Lead Factory, which considers molec- ular targets but not phenotypic approaches.

What is the purpose of a RA and what makes it a good one, and who decides that it is a good RA? Are there rules for easier writing? If the main function of a RA is to transfer a new knowledge on a research topic, then a good paper is the one that is clear, coherent, focused, well argued and uses language that does not have ambiguous or equivoque meaning. However, it is not only the message that is important. The RA must have a well-defined structure and function in serve like a cook-book, so the others can reproduce and repeat explained experiments. Answer research questions Give summary conclusions There are some rules that can make the writing and publishing of RAs 'easier'. Here, we summarised some 'golden' rules that should always be in the mind of an inexperienced researcher (Table 3). We put all these together to make a final list of some 40 logical steps, which can be find in the Appendix.

Structural clay tile has been used as a backing material for cavity wall construction. Structural clay tile for this purpose should conform to ASTM C 126, ASTM C 34 Specification for Structural Clay Load-Bearing Wall Tile or ASTM C 212 for Structural Clay Facing Tile.

As reflected in the statutory new drug and new animal drug approval standards in sections 505 109 and 512 of the FD&amp;C Act and the standard for licensure under section 351 of the PHS Act, the 110 evidence that is the basis for the risk assessment of a drug differs from the evidence that is the 111 basis for an effectiveness determination. The effectiveness determination is generally intended 112 to evaluate a drug’s positive effect based on adequate and well-controlled trials designed to 113 evaluate a specific efficacy variable (or a discrete number of efficacy variables) for the purpose 114 of distinguishing the effect of the drug from other influences.11 In contrast, FDA’s premarket 115 risk assessment is intended to identify and characterize the nature, frequency, and severity of the 116 usually broad spectrum of adverse events and other risks associated with the use of a product 117 based on a range of data sources. For human drugs, the supporting data are generally not derived 118 from studies designed to test a specific safety hypothesis. The assessment is based largely on 119 observations of adverse events from studies intended to assess effectiveness and includes all 120 patients exposed to the investigational drug during its development. For animal drugs, there are 121 generally data from safety studies in the target animal, in addition to observations of adverse 122 events from studies intended to assess effectiveness.12 For both human and animal drugs, 123 relevant data are weighted and integrated, based on the nature and reliability of the data sources, 124 into a coherent assessment of what adverse reactions are reasonably associated with the use of a 125 product and, to the extent possible, their frequency and severity.13 126

The FDA recently recommended that a warning be issued regarding adverse effects associated with BzRA hypnotics. These medications have been associated with reports of disruptive sleep related behaviors including sleepwalking, eating, driving, and sexual behavior. Patients should be cautioned about the potential for these adverse effects, and about the importance of allowing appropriate sleep time, using only prescribed doses and avoiding the combination of BzRA hypnotics with alcohol, other sedatives, and sleep restriction. General comments about sedatives/hypnotics:

Dessa maneira, no caso de um paciente menor, caso este seja menor de 16 anos, apenas o representante deverá assinar este termo (“representação”). Já, caso o paciente seja maior de 16 e menor de 18, tanto o representante legal, quanto o paciente, deverão assinar este termo (“assistência”).

1989). In the 1990’s newer agents were developed and marketed that had selective effects on GABA receptors in- cluding Zolpidem (Ambien), Zaleplon (Sonata), Eszopi- clone (Estorra) and Indiplon. While all hypnotics have abuse potential for individuals with addictive histories and personalities, these agents have been noted to have min- imal additive potential (Hajak et al. 2003). These agents are less likely to have deleterious side effects than most OTC treatments for insomnia, however, with increased use, more side effects including next effects on driving have been reported. This effect as well as next day re- bound insomnia has particularly been reported for higher doses of zolpidem (Verster et al. 2002). In many cases, MVA’s occurred in the period of somnolence and cogni- tive impairment during the first few hours after ingestion. Comparatively normal results on psychomotor tests can be obtained 3.25 h. after zaleplon ingestion and 6.25 h. after zopiclone ingestion (Paul et al. 2003). While these agents have excellent efficacy with minimal side effects, at higher doses these agents can exhibit benzodiazepine-like effects. Idiosyncratic reactions of persistent daytime som- nolence and/or memory loss have been reported. Some patients will report next day sedation after the nighttime use of these agents, as well as demonstrate an increased error rate in driving tests (Verster et al. 2007). Such infor- mation was forthcoming only after these drugs became generic and widely utilized in clinical practice. Most sedat- ing drugs if adopted into such widespread use would also be at least as likely to demonstrate epidemiological effects on MVA’s and MVA associated deaths. In the elderly, chronic use of sedating drugs (particularly those with anti-cholinergic side effects) can be associated with an increased risk for falls, and confusion (American Geriatrics Society 2015). Reported next day sleepiness and other side effects associated with hypnotic use are summarized in Table 3. The newer GABA-effective hypnotics are the only medications with demonstrated effectiveness in treating chronic insomnia (NIH State of the Science Conference

industry for anti-infectives overall, and significantly better than for other therapeutic areas, such as neurol- ogy and oncology. One difficulty with such an analysis is that new chemotypes have an inherently higher risk than additional members of established chemical classes, other than the risks of failure due to resistance (which are higher for drugs that have been used for many years). For this review’s new analysis (Table 8), new chemotypes are separated from life-cycle management projects. The overall success rates have not changed significantly in the last 3 years, either for MMV or for the CMR benchmark, which is reassuring. The data shows that a new molecule in formal preclinical evaluation has an 8% chance of becoming part of a product.

As reflected in the statutory new drug and new animal drug approval standards in sections 505 109 and 512 of the FD&amp;C Act and the standard for licensure under section 351 of the PHS Act, the 110 evidence that is the basis for the risk assessment of a drug differs from the evidence that is the 111 basis for an effectiveness determination. The effectiveness determination is generally intended 112 to evaluate a drug’s positive effect based on adequate and well-controlled trials designed to 113 evaluate a specific efficacy variable (or a discrete number of efficacy variables) for the purpose 114 of distinguishing the effect of the drug from other influences.11 In contrast, FDA’s premarket 115 risk assessment is intended to identify and characterize the nature, frequency, and severity of the 116 usually broad spectrum of adverse events and other risks associated with the use of a product 117 based on a range of data sources. For human drugs, the supporting data are generally not derived 118 from studies designed to test a specific safety hypothesis. The assessment is based largely on 119 observations of adverse events from studies intended to assess effectiveness and includes all 120 patients exposed to the investigational drug during its development. For animal drugs, there are 121 generally data from safety studies in the target animal, in addition to observations of adverse 122 events from studies intended to assess effectiveness.12 For both human and animal drugs, 123 relevant data are weighted and integrated, based on the nature and reliability of the data sources, 124 into a coherent assessment of what adverse reactions are reasonably associated with the use of a 125 product and, to the extent possible, their frequency and severity.13 126
In summary, public and non-profit-making sectors, and by extension tax-payers and philanthropists, have provided considerable financial and non-financial contributions towards the R&amp;D of cancer medicines. This means that in many cases, pharmaceutical companies have not incurred the full costs of R&amp;D. The pharmaceutical industry has also benefited greatly from the knowledge generated by public-sector investments in R&amp;D, and by having access to research supported by public funding at costs, if any, lower than the market value.

Building on Failures Researchers continue on their search for effective new treatments for the more than 120 forms of brain cancer, but they face great challenges.93 Since 1998, there have only been 3 new drug approvals for brain cancer, while another 75 medicines have failed in the development process having been discontinued, suspended, or had no development reported.94 That is a 25:1 ratio of unsuccessful attempts to FDA-approved medicines. Decades of research have provided limited treatment options for patients facing aggressive, late-stage forms of brain cancer. Although challenges persist, researchers continue to use past setbacks to inform future discoveries in brain cancer therapies.

AASM practice parameter papers are based on evidence- based review and grading of literature, often addressing a spe- cific issue or topic. Clinical guidelines provide clinicians with a working overview for disease or disorder evaluation and man- agement. These guidelines include practice parameter papers and also include areas with limited evidence in order to provide a comprehensive practice guideline. Both practice parameters and clinical guidelines define principles of practice that should meet the needs of most patients. They should not, however, be considered exhaustive, inclusive of all available methods of care, or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably expected to obtain the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding appropriateness of any specific therapy must be made by the clinician and patient in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible

The naïve interpretation of this is that no more than 13 candidate compounds would be needed for a reasonable chance of launching one new medicine, and 25 for a com- bination with two NCEs (new chemical entities). How- ever, if one aims for a 90% overall chance of success (P), the number of candidates n, each with a success probabil- ity s (8%) is described by the negative binomial distribu- tion in Eq. 1.

Reassessments might be per- formed less frequently for patients with more stable pain (eg, patients who have exhibited good pain con- trol without side effects after 24 hours of stable ther- apy). Pain reassessments might be useful at the time of nursing shift changes or with new caregivers to establish a baseline and promote continuity of care, although evidence showing that routine reassessment of pain at nursing shift changes is associated with improved clinical outcomes is not available.

With some variation over time and across cancer types, care for the cancer population involves the six categories of services analyzed. The bars in Figures 2a-2c indicate that some patients had significant use of facility services in the year preceding the cancer diagnosis. For both colorectal and lung cancers, total spending on hospital inpatient increased as a percentage of total immediately following diagnosis. In all three cancers, the chemotherapy share of total spending increased rapidly in the first few months after diagnosis and, with the exception of breast cancer, continued at a fairly consistent level of around 20% of spending in subsequent years. Radiation therapy represented a small share of total spending except for breast cancer patients in the year following diagnosis.

Participants also discovered that all RAS's can be separated in subsections or signposts, which can be arbitrary, but improve the structure of a RA. The recognized subsections were: research topic and definitions, research objectives (questions), methodological techniques, experimental set-up, object of the study (e.g. study area), main discoveries (analysed data), answers on research questions, explanation of the conclusions and further research and implications. The main RAS's are listed in a flow chart, showing main relations between different sections (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 shows the substructure of Introduction and Discussion RAS as the most important RAS's.

Your child has been identified as needing services for English Language Learners (ELL). Your child will be placed in the ESL/Bilingual Education dual language immersion program, as outlined in the attached document. We believe that this program will help meet your child’s educational needs and enhance his/her academic success in school. Your child will be assessed twice yearly, or as needed, to determine progress toward individual ELL goals. When your child scores in the acceptable range (4.5 Literacy/5.0 Overall) on all areas of the W-APT or ACCESS assessment they will be exited from the program. If your student currently has an Individualized Education Program (IEP), their needs will continue to be met through their current accommodations.

Proper Sizing-Firebox dimensions should be selected so that the fire fills the combustion chamber during operation. This provides greater heating efficiency. Careful consideration should be given to size of the fireplace opening best suited for the room in which it is to be located. Location and size are important not only from the standpoint of appearance, but also of operation. If the fireplace opening is too small, it may function properly but will not produce enough heat to warm the room. If the opening is too large, a fire that would fill the combustion chamber may overwhelm the room. In such a case, the firebox opening would require a larger flue area and consume larger amounts of interior air even if exterior combustion air is provided. Table 2 provides suggested widths of conventional fireplace openings appropriate for various room sizes. For example, a room with 300 ft2 (28 m2) of floor area is best served by a fireplace with an opening 30 in. (750 mm) to 36 in. (900 mm) wide.
Readership analysis was conducted on the 20 science journals in our data set (n(cid:1)2903). Articles published in the social sciences and humanities journals (n(cid:1)350) were omitted from the readership analysis, as many did not include abstract or full-text versions of their articles, and, in some cases, refer- ence views were added to full-text views, resulting in indeter- minate and incomparable results. Citation analyses were conducted on the entire article data set (n(cid:1)3245). A logistic regression model was used to estimate the likelihood of articles in each experimental group being cited within the first year after publication, controlling for journal and journal category effects.

Incidence numbers (column 2 = total, columns 3-7 = stages 0-IV, column 8 = stage unknown or “?”, for each row columns 3 through 8 add up to column 2), incidence rates in % for stages 0-IV and stage unknown (columns 9-13 = stages 0-IV, column 14 = stage unknown, for each row columns 9 through 14 add up to 100% up to rounding to 2 digits), and incidence rates for stages I-IV only with stage 0 and stage unknown specifically excluded (columns 15-18 = stages I-IV, for each row columns 15 through 18 add up to 100% up to rounding to 2 digits). The incidence numbers are based on the data for California adults aged 20 and older diagnosed with the cancers listed in column 1 during 2005-2009 as reported in [Morris et al, 2013]. Some cancer sites in column 1 are abbreviated as follows: Breast = female breast, Cervix = cervix uteri, Rectum = rectum and rectosigmoid junction, Kidney = kidney and renal pelvis, liver = liver and intrahepatic bile ducts, Lung = lung and bronchus, Melanoma = melanoma of the skin, Oral = oral cavity and pharynx, Bladder = urinary bladder, Uterine = uterine corpus. For Bladder, stage I includes stage 0 (stage I = stage 0/I).
the context description CUI→ST obtains the high- est overall accuracy. On the con(cid:3)ated dataset, the pseudowords a a, a o, d d and e e have a corresponding CUI de(cid:2)ni- tion for each of their possible concepts therefore the accuracy for CUI and CUI→ would be the same for these datasets and is not reported. The pseudowords a a i, x p p and d a m e do not have a CUI de(cid:2)ni- tions for each of their possible concepts. The results show that CUI obtained the highest accuracy for six out of the seven datasets and CUI→ST obtained the highest accuracy for one. These experiments were run using the unigram feature.

For newer targeted cancer medicines, there are two additional areas of uncertainty. Firstly, despite their established mechanisms of action, targeted cancer medicines may not have clinically-meaningful activities against all tumours with a matching genetic mutation. To this point, a clinical trial has found that the progression-free survival of patients with metastatic solid tumour refractory to standard of care did not improve with the use of targeted therapies that matched with the tumour’s molecular profile but outside their approved indications, compared to patients who received treatment at the choice of their treating physicians (79). This means that targeted therapies should only be used according to approved indications and not based on identified molecular alternations or the general type of cancer.

veys, and frequent teleconference discussions, the expert panel identified consensus areas and recommendations for those areas not covered by AASM practice parameters. Recommendations were generated by panel members and discussed by all. To min- imize individual expert bias, the group anonymously voted and rated consensus recommendations from 1: strongly disagree to 9: strongly agree. Consensus was defined when all experts rated a recommendation 8 or 9. If consensus was not evident after the first vote, the consensus recommendations were discussed again, amended as appropriate, and a second anonymous vote was conducted. If consensus was not evident after the second vote, the process was repeated until consensus was attained to include or exclude a recommendation.

Parasitemia is determined microscopically by counting 4 fields of approximately 100 erythrocytes per field. For low parasitemias (&lt;1%), up to 4000 erythrocytes have to be counted. Alternatively the parasitemia can also be determined by FACS analysis, which works particularly well for parasitemias &gt;1%. The difference between the mean value of the control group (taken as 100%) and those of the experimental groups is calculated and expressed as percent reduction (= activity) using the following equation:
Insomnia occurs in individuals of all ages and races, and has been observed across all cultures and countries.8,9 The actual prevalence of insomnia varies according to the stringency of the definition used. Insomnia symptoms occur in approximately 33% to 50% of the adult population; insomnia symptoms with dis- tress or impairment (i.e., general insomnia disorder) in 10% to 15%; and specific insomnia disorders in 5% to 10%.10 Consis- tent risk factors for insomnia include increasing age, female sex, comorbid (medical, psychiatric, sleep, and substance use) disor- ders, shift work, and possibly unemployment and lower socio- economic status. Patients with comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions are at particularly increased risk, with psychiatric and chronic pain disorders having insomnia rates as high as 50% to 75%.11-13 The risk relationship between insomnia and psychiatric disorders appears to be bidirectional; several studies have also

Sleep-inducing drugs (hypnotics) are medications specif- ically designed to induce sleepiness directly after intake. Optimal agents affect cognitive performance during this period while inducing minimal sleepiness in the waking day after use. An optimal hypnotic would have low tox- icity and addictive potential, as well a minimal side effect profile (Oswald 1970). Among the first hypnotics, and an agent still in use is chloral hydrate - the original “Mickey Finn” - slipped into the drinks of unsuspecting marks for the purposes of criminal activity. Unfortu- nately, this medication is difficult to use since the LD-50 (potentially fatal dose) is quite close to the therapeutic dose. In the years leading up to the 1970’s, rapidly acting barbiturates were commonly utilized for their hypnotic effects. Unfortunately, these medications, also drugs of abuse, had a significant danger of overdose and contrib- uted to an era that was characterized in part by deaths due to overdoses of sleeping pills. These medications and similar barbiturate-like medications [Methaqualone (Quaalude, Sopor) Glutethimide (Doriden), Ethchlor- vynol (Placidyl), Methyprylon (Nodudar)] have limited availability and are rarely used due to limited efficacy, cognitive effects, the potential for abuse and lethal tox- icity associated with overdose (Oswald 1970). Today their primary therapeutic uses include executions and fa- cilitated euthanasia (Lossignol 2008). Most currently utilized hypnotics affect the widely dis- persed negative neurotransmitter GABA. In the 1970’s benzodiazepines (GABA agonists) were first marketed as hypnotics. Some of these agents had an extremely short duration of action [Triazolam (Halcion)]. While this agent-induced minimal next day somnolence, use was as- sociated with daytime memory impairment, particularly at higher dosages (Roehrs et al. 2000; Adam and Oswald

• Mood disturbances and cognitive difficulties. Complaints of irritability, loss of interest, mild depression and anxi- ety are common among insomnia patients. Patients with chronic insomnia often complain of mental inefficiency, difficulty remembering, difficulty focusing attention, and difficulty with complex mental tasks. • Quality of life: The irritability and fatigue associated with insomnia may cause interpersonal difficulties for insomnia patients, or avoidance of such activities. Conversely, in- terpersonal difficulties may be an important contributor to insomnia problems for some individuals. Sleep and wak- ing problems may lead to restriction of daytime activities, including social events, exercise, or work. Lack of regular daytime activities and exercise may in turn contribute to insomnia. • Exacerbation of comorbid conditions. Comorbid condi- tions may cause or increase sleep difficulties. Likewise, poor sleep may exacerbate symptomatology of comorbid conditions. Sleep complaints may herald the onset of mood disorders or exacerbation of comorbid conditions. VI. Other History: A complete insomnia history also in- cludes medical, psychiatric, medication/substance, and family/ social/occupational histories.

Based on the size of the flue selected, a preliminary damper size must be assumed. At this point in the design process, it is only necessary to decide if the damper throat area to be used will be equal to or twice the flue area. Once this decision has been made the Inlet Loss Coefficient, K 2, may be determined. If the damper throat area is equal to the flue area, K 2 is equal to 2.5. If the damper throat is twice the flue area, K 2 is equal to 1.0.

In the late 1800s, Andrew Taylor Still identified the neuromusculoskeletal system as the key element in health maintenance and stressed preventive aspects of medi- cine in place of drug therapy. During that time, osteop- athy was truly separate and distinct from the world of allo- pathic medicine. Since then, as medicine in general has become more evidence-based and supported by research, osteopathic philosophy has evolved into a more complete and robust osteopathic medicine. The phrase “osteopathic medicine” is now the accepted term for the profession over “osteopathy,” a now-antiquated term that represents a period when Still championed a near-drugless form of manual medicine. Since its conception, osteopathic med- icine has adapted its body of knowledge to incorporate contemporary scientific thought, including germ theory, pharmacology, and other “allopathic” teachings. The cen- tral tenets of osteopathic thought, however, have been maintained and continue to guide DOs in their practice of medicine. Though interprofessional relations between MDs and DOs are better than they have ever been before, challenges still exist in terms of keeping the osteopathic tradition intact, improving the evidence basis of OMM via clinical research, and advocating for widespread recogni- tion of DOs.
medicine (NMM) and OMM obtain many more hundreds of hours of manual medicine training in a wider variety of clinical settings than DCs and other DOs. This section was meant to give you a better sense of what “osteopathic manipulative medicine” entails, and hopefully it answered most of your questions regarding OMM. The effectiveness of OMM remains a topic of ongoing debate and research despite past and current efforts to lay these arguments to rest. Whether an osteo- pathic physician uses OMM in his or her practice is based entirely on preference. With that said, it is an important core discipline and primary distinction of the osteopathic profession.

6. Identify the efflorescence. Knowing the composition of efflorescing salts is sometimes of use. Table 1, taken from Brownell’s report lists the most probable sources of efflorescing salts. Commercial testing laboratories can use X-ray diffraction, petrographic analysis or chemical analysis can, in some instances, determine both the type of salts present and their relative quantity. 7. Consider miscellaneous sources of water when all obvious sources have been eliminated. Some of these sources are: condensation within the wall, poorly directed landscape sprinklers, leaky pipes, faulty drains and condensation on heating or plumbing pipes. If necessary, condensation analysis methods are described in Technical Note 47.

concussion tests. If it is clear an athlete has an SRC, additional sideline testing can be discontinued. Sport-specific rules may not allow adequate time for evaluation, and modifying these rules remains an area for improvement within the governing bodies of some sports. (C) When the sports medicine clinician becomes aware of a poten- tial injury, the athlete is approached and a brief history of the event is obtained from the athlete and those who witnessed the event or athlete behaviour. How the athlete responds to the elements of orientation, memory, concentration and balance is evaluated, as well as speech patterns and how the athlete appears to be processing information. Cervical palpation and range of motion (ROM) are also typically performed to assess for other

In the absence of financial support from governments, the treatment costs presented in Table 4.3 would not be affordable to individual patients. For example, a course of standard (adjuvant) treatment for early stage HER2 positive breast cancer (Adjuvant AC-TH) would cost about 10 years of average annual wages in India and South Africa, and 1.7 years in the USAxx. Patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in India, South Africa and the USA would require, respectively, 3.7 years, 5.6 years and 1.1 years of wages to cover for the costs of a

The FDA recently recommended that a warning be issued regarding adverse effects associated with BzRA hypnotics. These medications have been associated with reports of disruptive sleep related behaviors including sleepwalking, eating, driving, and sexual behavior. Patients should be cautioned about the potential for these adverse effects, and about the importance of allowing appropriate sleep time, using only prescribed doses and avoiding the combination of BzRA hypnotics with alcohol, other sedatives, and sleep restriction. General comments about sedatives/hypnotics:

samples)) / (geometric mean cpm of no drug samples). Percentage reductions are used to plot percentage inhibition of growth as a function of drug concentrations. IC 50 values are determined by linear regression analyses on the linear segments of the curves (IC 90 values can also be determined by curve-fitting and can provide an useful measure of variation between experiments). Assays are typically repeated on two or three separate occasions. Within each experiment, standard deviations are typically less than 10% of the mean. Differences in parasite stages of development can lead to up to two-fold shifts in the IC 50 values between experiments; however, these differences rarely affect the overall relationships between the parasite lines in terms of their differences in drug response 4-11 .

veys, and frequent teleconference discussions, the expert panel identified consensus areas and recommendations for those areas not covered by AASM practice parameters. Recommendations were generated by panel members and discussed by all. To min- imize individual expert bias, the group anonymously voted and rated consensus recommendations from 1: strongly disagree to 9: strongly agree. Consensus was defined when all experts rated a recommendation 8 or 9. If consensus was not evident after the first vote, the consensus recommendations were discussed again, amended as appropriate, and a second anonymous vote was conducted. If consensus was not evident after the second vote, the process was repeated until consensus was attained to include or exclude a recommendation.

The prevailing models of emergency medical transport used in North America and Western Europe are quite costly and would be impractical for most low-income countries. Severe resource constraints, the poor condition of roads or trails, and a lack of fuel may dictate the utilization of a wider range of options. In the United Republic of Tanzania, for example, modes of emergency transportation include motor- boats, canoes, bicycles with trailers, tricycles with platforms, tractors with trailers, reconditioned vehicles, and ox carts (22).
We used an expert provided list of 42 relevant domain terms for the Myocardial Perfusion Imaging domain (a sub-domain of nuclear cardiology) to heuristically test the coverage of our ontology terms. Of these, we found 31 exactly matching terms, 2 morphological variants and 8 phrases that contained the terms from the expert list. Out of this 42 domain terms, 1 term, ‘dyperidamole’, was not found in our ontology (dyperidamole is a drug given during pregnancy). We found that this term didn’t exist in the 618 JNC abstracts we were using. Instead, another term, diperidamole (spelling variant) existed in our term list. To do away with noise in our data, we selected terms with greater than average frequency (2.9) of the 10191 retrieved terms and set that as our threshold. We pruned the list to

a physician intentionally stimulates a physiologic response by CO 2 inhalation [31], sodium lactate infusion [32,33], or cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4) injection [32,34]. These chemical exposures are used as potent tools to design controlled studies with predictable levels of PA episodes. In a study with healthy volunteer subjects using carbon dioxide inhalation to provoke panic and anxiety, propranolol significantly decreased heart rate, a cardiovascular somatic symptom, but did not provide psychic anxiolytic benefit [35].

medicine when following up n candidate molecules. The numerical solutions for this equation show that at least 48 molecules are to be evaluated for this probability to exceed 90%. The MMV discovery portfolio was built and funded to deliver two new preclinical candidates per year, and allowing for a third molecule coming from else- where, then this would still require some 16 years’ invest- ment per combination, except if there is a considerable increase in success rates going forwards (and a justifica- tion for this), or significantly increased investment. The hope on the horizon is that many of the new molecules are first-in-class, and so should they fail in clinical devel- opment there will be scope for well-defined back-up pro- jects, and these are normally much more cost-effective programmes. The definition of new molecular targets also opens up new possibilities for engaging the wider research community, allowing access to resources such as the EU’s European Lead Factory, which considers molec- ular targets but not phenotypic approaches.

The analysis found that low-income countries could spend on average up to US$ 3800 per cancer patient annually on cancer medicines for all newly-diagnosed cancer patients, and the total expenditure on these medicines would be within the generously assumed 5% of the total health expenditure (Table 4.2). In high- income countries, the analysis found that a budget threshold of 5% of the total health expenditure would allow a spending of up to US$ 40 600 on cancer medicines per patient per year, with a view to providing universal coverage.

• Fatigue and sleepiness. Feelings of fatigue (low energy, physical tiredness, weariness) are more common than symptoms of sleepiness (actual tendency to fall asleep) in patients with chronic insomnia. The presence of significant sleepiness should prompt a search for other potential sleep disorders. The number, duration, and timing of naps should be thoroughly investigated, as both a consequence of in- somnia and a potential contributing factor.

medically related text and metadata features, such as “pa- tients,” “alzheimer,” “health information management,” and “medicine” are also important and of mostly positive polar- ity, since medical articles attract greater news coverage than, say, a recently published computer science paper. As we dis- cuss later, the presence of “alzheimer” as an important, neg- ative feature is more an artifact of the dataset than an iden- tification of trends in popularity. We also find an artifact of year (2016) of the dataset with the feature “zika virus,” due to the 2015-2016 zika epidemic in North and South Amer- ica. Three publishers appear in the top 20, the Massachusetts Medical Society, the publisher of the New England Journal ofMedicine,oneofthemostprestigiouspeer-reviewedmed- ical journals, “The Royal Society,” publisher of the less pres- tigious, but longest-running scientific journal, “Philosophi- cal Transactions of the Royal Society,” and “Elsevier,” one of the largest science publishers.

the top 10. We also extract and treat as binary features four different types of subjects from Altmetric and CrossRef: Medline subject codes for journal (Altmetric), subjects as indexed by SCOPUS (Altmetric), publisher subjects (Altmetric), and CrossRef subjects. Subjects are mostly at the granularity of the journal or higher. Similar journals have subjects in com- mon, with, for instance, the journals Nature Conservation, Conservation Biology, Ecology and Evolution, and many more sharing the CrossRef subject “nature and landscape conservation.”Multidisciplinaryjournals,suchasPNASand Nature, are often tagged with more general subjects such as “science” or “multidisciplinary.” Table 2 displays the top 10 CrossRef subjects describing at least 100 articles by aver- age news coverage. As expected, health related subjects top the list, along with those related to the environment. Unfor- tunately, but as expected, “general computer science” and “computational mathematics” secured the last places, at 0.5 and 0.3 news articles on average, respectively. We also extract textual features, when available, for each document: Title, Abstract, Press Release. For scientific ar- ticles with more than one press release, we randomly select one. For each type of text document, we preprocess using a standard English stop word list, extracting counts of un- igrams and bigrams, keeping tokens which appear in more than one document and no more than 80% of documents of the same type in the training set. We keep the 30,000 most frequently occurring features in the training set. We then scale the vectors of counts by tfidf weights fit on the training set. Finally, we create a boolean feature hasPR indicating whether the scientific article received coverage on one of the two prominent press release aggregation websites, Eu- rekAlert! or Science Daily. We hypothesize that mention on one of these would expose the scientific article to more jour- nalists and thus garner more coverage.
Sexual problems after cancer treatment affect survivors of many different cancers, including breast, bladder, colorectal, prostate, and gynecological.41-44 Issues vary greatly in severity and tend not to be resolved unless specific treatments are provided, which may include medical therapies; non-hormonal, water-based lubricants and moisturizers; and psychoeducational support, group therapy, sexual counseling, marital counseling, or psychotherapy.45

The use of two antimalarials simultaneously, especially when the antimalarials have different mechanisms of action, has the potential for inhib- iting the development of resistance to either of the components. The efficacy of a combination of a 4-aminoquinoline drug (either chloroquine or amo- diaquine) with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine has been reviewed (43). The results of this review sug- gested that the addition of either chloroquine or amodiaquine to SP marginally improved parasitological clearance (compared with SP alone). The studies reviewed were mostly done in areas and at times when both SP and chloroquine/amodi- aquine retained a fair amount of efficacy, and it is not clear from these studies how well such a combination would act in areas where one of the components was significantly compromised. Additionally, to date, there are no data to suggest whether this slightly improved clearance would

In addition to return to learning and sporting environments, older athletes may need to return to driving, where subtle defi- cits could compromise safety. Most sports medicine physicians do not counsel athletes with SRC about driving.90 Driving is a complex process involving coordination of cognitive, visual and motor skills, as well as concentration, attention, visual percep- tion, insight and memory, which can all be affected by SRC.90 Little is known about the risk of driving after SRC, but prelim- inary data suggest some impairment exists when patients with concussion report they are asymptomatic.91 Currently, no widely

industry for anti-infectives overall, and significantly better than for other therapeutic areas, such as neurol- ogy and oncology. One difficulty with such an analysis is that new chemotypes have an inherently higher risk than additional members of established chemical classes, other than the risks of failure due to resistance (which are higher for drugs that have been used for many years). For this review’s new analysis (Table 8), new chemotypes are separated from life-cycle management projects. The overall success rates have not changed significantly in the last 3 years, either for MMV or for the CMR benchmark, which is reassuring. The data shows that a new molecule in formal preclinical evaluation has an 8% chance of becoming part of a product.

Based on the size of the flue selected, a preliminary damper size must be assumed. At this point in the design process, it is only necessary to decide if the damper throat area to be used will be equal to or twice the flue area. Once this decision has been made the Inlet Loss Coefficient, K 2, may be determined. If the damper throat area is equal to the flue area, K 2 is equal to 2.5. If the damper throat is twice the flue area, K 2 is equal to 1.0.

The structural design of cavity walls should follow either rational or empirical methods. The rational design method is based on the properties of the wall materials and engineering analysis. This method may be used for any structure where high loads are likely or where tall walls are a necessity. The empirical method is generally satisfactory for one and two-story buildings consisting of light construction with limited floor spans and wall heights; and for multistory buildings where unsupported wall heights are not excessive.

of care data [ 12 ] . The NCI estimate for expenditure on prostate cancer treatment in 2006 was $9.862 billion, and average Medicare payments per patient in the fi rst year after diagnosis were $11 000. It should be noted when interpreting this data that use of PSA testing for prostate cancer is more widespread in the USA than in many other countries, thus increasing the number of cases identifi ed. In addition, Medicare did not cover certain cancer care expenses such as oral medicines, commonly used to treat prostate cancer until January 2006. These out-of-pocket costs may comprise 10% of the $11 000 estimate. Direct medical expenditures are only one part of the total economic burden of cancer, as cancer- related illnesses and death lead to losses in economic productivity.

Building on Failures Researchers continue on their search for effective new treatments for the more than 120 forms of brain cancer, but they face great challenges.93 Since 1998, there have only been 3 new drug approvals for brain cancer, while another 75 medicines have failed in the development process having been discontinued, suspended, or had no development reported.94 That is a 25:1 ratio of unsuccessful attempts to FDA-approved medicines. Decades of research have provided limited treatment options for patients facing aggressive, late-stage forms of brain cancer. Although challenges persist, researchers continue to use past setbacks to inform future discoveries in brain cancer therapies.

Numerous alternative beta blockers are available in lieu of propranolol. Notable among these is the common drug, atenolol, that is available in oral solid dose forms ranging from 25 to 100 mg for the treatment of hypertension. Multiple doses per day may be permitted. It has been used to suppress stage fright in performers when administered orally in advance [45]. Atenolol is a beta-1 selective peripheral-acting agent without CNS effects, which should reduce the risk for asthmatic subjects [46]. Thus, atenolol might be preferred over the nonselective beta blockers for patients affected by asthma or COPD [47]. Oral atenolol at 50 - 200 mg doses suppressed heart rate by ~ 23 - 24 beats per minute (bpm) vs. ~ 10 bpm on placebo [46]. Also,

istic option. Clinical diagnosis offers the advantages of ease, speed, and low cost. In areas where malaria is prevalent, clinical diagnosis usually results in all patients with fever and no apparent other cause being treated for malaria. This approach can iden- tify most patients who truly need antimalarial treat- ment, but it is also likely to misclassify many who do not (15). Over-diagnosis can be considerable and contributes to misuse of antimalarial drugs. Considerable overlap exists between the signs and

return-to-sport progression is individualised and is a function of the injury, the athlete’s age, prior SRC and level of play, and the ability to provide close supervision during the return to activity. The return-to-sport progression presented by the CISG is widely accepted but empiric, without evidence to support either the progression sequence or the time spent in each stage. In general, for young athletes, each stage of the progression should be at least 24 hours without return of symptoms before progressing to the next stage. (C)

Phase 1. The aim of Phase 1 was to identify the contributions of clinical and laboratory variables that in practice were the most predictive of the decision to initiate DMARD therapy in a population of patients with early undifferentiated synovitis. Initiation of DMARD therapy was used as an indicator of the physician’s opinion that the patient was at risk of developing persistent and/or erosive arthritis that we would currently consider to be RA. Data on 3,115 patients from 9 early arthritis cohorts who were consid- ered not to have evidence of another possible diagnosis explaining their presentation were obtained. Between July 2007 and November 2008 an expert working group developed an analysis strategy that related an agreed- upon list of standardized clinical and laboratory vari- ables collected at baseline to the initiation of DMARD treatment within the next 12 months. MTX initiation was used as the gold standard for this purpose. The analytical process aimed to identify the independent contribution of each variable on this list and included univariate regression modeling, a subsequent principal components analysis, and a multivariate regression model that included all identified components (25). The resulting list of informative variables identified during that process and the weights based on the odds ratios are shown in Table 1. Phase 2. Phase 2 consisted of a consensus-based, decision science–informed approach, which took place between November 2008 and June 2009. The purpose of this phase was to derive a clinician-based judgment on
When analyzing the data, we found that there does not exist a CUI de(cid:2)nition for a large number of pos- sible concepts. Table 5 shows the number of words in the CUI and ST de(cid:2)nitions for each concept in the NLM-WSD dataset. Only four target words have a CUI de(cid:2)nition for each possible concept. We also found the concept de(cid:2)nitions vary widely in length. The CUI de(cid:2)nitions in the UMLS come from a va- riety of sources and there may exist more than one de(cid:2)nition per source. Unlike CUI de(cid:2)nitions, there does exist an ST de(cid:2)nition for each possible con- cept. The ST de(cid:2)nitions come from the same source and are approximately the same length but they are a broad categorization. We believe this makes them too coarse grained to provide descriptive enough in- formation about their associated concepts.

of care data [ 12 ] . The NCI estimate for expenditure on prostate cancer treatment in 2006 was $9.862 billion, and average Medicare payments per patient in the fi rst year after diagnosis were $11 000. It should be noted when interpreting this data that use of PSA testing for prostate cancer is more widespread in the USA than in many other countries, thus increasing the number of cases identifi ed. In addition, Medicare did not cover certain cancer care expenses such as oral medicines, commonly used to treat prostate cancer until January 2006. These out-of-pocket costs may comprise 10% of the $11 000 estimate. Direct medical expenditures are only one part of the total economic burden of cancer, as cancer- related illnesses and death lead to losses in economic productivity.

a physician intentionally stimulates a physiologic response by CO 2 inhalation [31], sodium lactate infusion [32,33], or cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4) injection [32,34]. These chemical exposures are used as potent tools to design controlled studies with predictable levels of PA episodes. In a study with healthy volunteer subjects using carbon dioxide inhalation to provoke panic and anxiety, propranolol significantly decreased heart rate, a cardiovascular somatic symptom, but did not provide psychic anxiolytic benefit [35].

As reflected in the statutory new drug and new animal drug approval standards in sections 505 109 and 512 of the FD&amp;C Act and the standard for licensure under section 351 of the PHS Act, the 110 evidence that is the basis for the risk assessment of a drug differs from the evidence that is the 111 basis for an effectiveness determination. The effectiveness determination is generally intended 112 to evaluate a drug’s positive effect based on adequate and well-controlled trials designed to 113 evaluate a specific efficacy variable (or a discrete number of efficacy variables) for the purpose 114 of distinguishing the effect of the drug from other influences.11 In contrast, FDA’s premarket 115 risk assessment is intended to identify and characterize the nature, frequency, and severity of the 116 usually broad spectrum of adverse events and other risks associated with the use of a product 117 based on a range of data sources. For human drugs, the supporting data are generally not derived 118 from studies designed to test a specific safety hypothesis. The assessment is based largely on 119 observations of adverse events from studies intended to assess effectiveness and includes all 120 patients exposed to the investigational drug during its development. For animal drugs, there are 121 generally data from safety studies in the target animal, in addition to observations of adverse 122 events from studies intended to assess effectiveness.12 For both human and animal drugs, 123 relevant data are weighted and integrated, based on the nature and reliability of the data sources, 124 into a coherent assessment of what adverse reactions are reasonably associated with the use of a 125 product and, to the extent possible, their frequency and severity.13 126

receptor antagonist that affects the autonomic nervous system and reduces cardiovascular symptoms (e.g., tachycardia and hypertension) resulting from epinephrine in the circulation. Beta blockers interfere with receptor binding by catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine, of which epinephrine is the principal catecholamine affecting the cardiovascular symptoms. Propranolol is a lipophilic beta blocker that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, it can affect both somatic and CNS target tissues.

The structural design of cavity walls should follow either rational or empirical methods. The rational design method is based on the properties of the wall materials and engineering analysis. This method may be used for any structure where high loads are likely or where tall walls are a necessity. The empirical method is generally satisfactory for one and two-story buildings consisting of light construction with limited floor spans and wall heights; and for multistory buildings where unsupported wall heights are not excessive.

The industry also often justifies prices of medicine by stating that return on investment needs to be sufficient to incentivize the discovery of future medicines (109). To this point, the industry noted that 20% of its revenues were re-invested into R&amp;D (87).
Building on Failures Researchers continue on their search for effective new treatments for the more than 120 forms of brain cancer, but they face great challenges.93 Since 1998, there have only been 3 new drug approvals for brain cancer, while another 75 medicines have failed in the development process having been discontinued, suspended, or had no development reported.94 That is a 25:1 ratio of unsuccessful attempts to FDA-approved medicines. Decades of research have provided limited treatment options for patients facing aggressive, late-stage forms of brain cancer. Although challenges persist, researchers continue to use past setbacks to inform future discoveries in brain cancer therapies.
the fact that 11 of the 12 medicines approved by the United States Food &amp; Drug Administration (US FDA) in 2012 for various cancer indications were priced above US$ 100 000 per year. The experts asserted that the prices of these medicines were too high, unsustainable, might compromise access of needy patients to highly effective therapy, and harmful to the sustainability of national health care systems (30). Similarly, in 2015, yet another group of cancer experts have petitioned for lower medicine prices (31).

medicine (NMM) and OMM obtain many more hundreds of hours of manual medicine training in a wider variety of clinical settings than DCs and other DOs. This section was meant to give you a better sense of what “osteopathic manipulative medicine” entails, and hopefully it answered most of your questions regarding OMM. The effectiveness of OMM remains a topic of ongoing debate and research despite past and current efforts to lay these arguments to rest. Whether an osteo- pathic physician uses OMM in his or her practice is based entirely on preference. With that said, it is an important core discipline and primary distinction of the osteopathic profession.

Phase 1. The aim of Phase 1 was to identify the contributions of clinical and laboratory variables that in practice were the most predictive of the decision to initiate DMARD therapy in a population of patients with early undifferentiated synovitis. Initiation of DMARD therapy was used as an indicator of the physician’s opinion that the patient was at risk of developing persistent and/or erosive arthritis that we would currently consider to be RA. Data on 3,115 patients from 9 early arthritis cohorts who were consid- ered not to have evidence of another possible diagnosis explaining their presentation were obtained. Between July 2007 and November 2008 an expert working group developed an analysis strategy that related an agreed- upon list of standardized clinical and laboratory vari- ables collected at baseline to the initiation of DMARD treatment within the next 12 months. MTX initiation was used as the gold standard for this purpose. The analytical process aimed to identify the independent contribution of each variable on this list and included univariate regression modeling, a subsequent principal components analysis, and a multivariate regression model that included all identified components (25). The resulting list of informative variables identified during that process and the weights based on the odds ratios are shown in Table 1. Phase 2. Phase 2 consisted of a consensus-based, decision science–informed approach, which took place between November 2008 and June 2009. The purpose of this phase was to derive a clinician-based judgment on

The goals of treatment are to “cure” the cancer, if possible; pro- long survival; and provide the highest possible quality of life during and after treatment. A cancer is cured when all traces of the cancer have been removed from the patient’s body. Although it is usually not possible to know if the cancer is completely eradicated, for many patients, the initial course of therapy is successful and the cancer never returns. However, some cancer- free survivors must cope with the long-term effects of treatment, as well as psychological concerns such as fear of recurrence. Cancer patients, caregivers, and survivors must have the infor- mation and support they need to play an active role in decisions that affect treatment and quality of life.

Psychiatry
One can reasonably assert that this beneficial anxiolytic effect might have been enhanced even further under three study design conditions. First, if the inclusion criteria had required each patient to have a high anxiety score prior to the procedure, for instance a minimum of 7 points (with 10 as the maximum), there would have been a greater potential for a difference pre-treatment vs. during the procedure. The six responders had a baseline average of 6.3 points, so there was room for improvement. Of the six responders, two subjects had low baseline anxiety scores (i.e., patient F at 4 points and patient I at 2 points). A higher baseline inclusion parameter could have increased the differential prior to vs. during the EMG procedure. Second, there might not have been a sufficiently long waiting period between the drug administration and the procedure. One can reasonably assert that if the time interval between dosing and the procedure was increased to a minimum of 30 minutes or more (from the 10 – 20 minutes), the percentage of responders and the magnitude of the response could have been greater. However, it should be noted that often in a clinic time-is-of-the-essence between the patient’s initial assessment by the medical provider and the subsequent medical procedure. Some medical providers are willing to pre-treat an anxious patient, typically with an oral benzodiazepine either swallowed intact or pre-dissolved in water, and then have him/her wait (e.g., 30 + min.) for an anxiolytic effect to be acknowledged by the patient. But, some physicians and dentists might be under time constraints or might not be willing to oblige the patient this waiting period. This would not be an obstacle if either the drug has a rapid onset of effect or the patient were to pre-treat themselves immediately prior to arrival at the physician’s office, for instance 30-60 minutes in advance. Even under the conditions of this study that the authors consider might have been sub-optimal, this drug combo delivered by the oral mucosal route provided a rapid onset effect as a PRN medication. This anxiolytic benefit may be useful in treating anticipatory anxiety either in-office or prior to arrival. There is a third limitation to this study to consider. The compounded medicine contained 25 mg of atenolol and 0.2 mg of scopolamine HBr.

The temperature change used for estimating thermal movements should be based on mean temperatures in the component. For solid masonry walls, tempera- tures at the center of the wall should be used. In cav- ity walls and veneers, the temperature at the center of each wythe or component should be used. In dis- continuous construction, the wythes will have different temperatures due to the separation of the wythes by an air space and perhaps insulation.

6. Evaluating – can include commenting on the degrees of success and failure of something, or the value of something The ability to analyze and creatively adapt to new situations is at the heart of critical thinking. Paul and Elder (2008, 2014b) asserted that critical thinking provides a vehicle for educating the mind. John Dewey would agree, as from his early work, we have increased our sense of the pragmatic basis of human thought (its instrumental nature), and especially its grounding in actual human purposes, goals, and objectives. Dewey (1910) also discussed critical thinking in terms of reflective thinking, which is an uneasiness in accepting the status quo and that critical thinking is both an emotional and intellectual component. Students must, therefore, be taught to examine, poke, question, and reflect on what they have learned. Scepticism, questioning, and reflection is essential. Dewey also stated that schools should have an intimate relationship with the community it serves. From the review of the research concerning critical thinking and what components are considered important in high school education and later a life-long learning skill, the authors developed a 5-step, critical thinking teaching process as outlined in Table 2. Input from the study’s nine experts who reviewed the model and from suggestions from other model developers, led to the selection of easy to remember letters that describe each step’s process.
Dose ranging test: Here, compounds are tested at a minimum of 4 different doses (the “dose ranging, full 4-day test”, typically 100, 30, 10 and 3 mg/kg, by both s.c. and p.o. routes of administration). ED 50 and ED 90 values are calculated by plotting the log dose against probit activity (for example, using Microcal “Origin”). These reflect the drug concentrations at which 50% and 90% of suppression of parasitemia is achieved. Note that with short half-life drugs it may be necessary to dose multiple times per day. Two other parameters measured in this study are relative potency compared to an appropriate standard drug, and oral bioavailability (assessed by comparison of oral and parenteral administration).

considerable challenge in assessing, measuring and translating the value of a medicine to a price. In particular, there is no universally accepted view on what dimensions of value should be considered for the purpose of determining medicine prices. Fig. 3.8 (p.34) shows the various dimensions of value noted in the literature and government guidelines, summarized into eight themes. Common dimensions considered in health technology assessments are: clinical and public health needs for the proposed medicine, clinical evidence, economic and financial public health considerations. More debatable is whether to include as innovativeness of the medicine, and the need to incentivize future
A patient’s decision to use an OON provider selection may be intentional or accidental. Reasons patients may incur OON costs include patient preference for a particular provider or specialty care center that may be out of network, the lack of network providers with appropriate specialists, and the lack of awareness or transparency about which providers are in the patient’s plan network. Common scenarios for accidental use of OON providers are emergency care or care from an OON provider working at an in-network hospital (e.g., radiologist, assistant surgeon, anesthesiologist).22 23 Figure 9 suggests that there might be significant financial consequences to the patient going out of network, which could be exacerbated if health plans remove popular cancer providers from their networks. Figure 9 also provides information on the relationship between the OON percentage (right vertical axis--relative to total spending) and total patient cost-sharing (left vertical axis). While most patients in our study reported under 10% of all OOP cost in the year of diagnosis is spent on out-of- network providers, those in the highest percentile of OOP spending incurred as much as 40% of those costs out-of-network.

Although, it was assumed that the 'thicker' articles with wider range of vocabulary is preferable in the editors hands, the editors (and probably the readers) prefer simple, clear and coherent writing, rather than a fancy or complex, pseudo-scientific style. Also Funkhouser and Maccoby (1971) showed that the information gain is especially enhanced by the “use of examples", i.e. it helps a lot to use some non-science material, such as everyday life parallels, historical points, etc. On the other hand, some sections, such as Introduction and Discussion, have to intrigue readers and attract interest and should therefore not be over-simplified. For example, a mysterious title can catch readers' attention and will be easily remembered (e.g.: T.Y. Li and J. Yorke named their famous paper on chaos: "The period three means chaos"). Some sections require more skill and are more important. It is approximated that from all published journal RAs in the world, only less than 5% are read in detail. However, more than 50% of abstracts are read and so the quality of an abstracts is much more important (Gordon, 1983). Therefore, the abstract should present the 'story' of the RA in miniature and should be readable standalone.

Building on Failures Researchers continue on their search for effective new treatments for the more than 120 forms of brain cancer, but they face great challenges.93 Since 1998, there have only been 3 new drug approvals for brain cancer, while another 75 medicines have failed in the development process having been discontinued, suspended, or had no development reported.94 That is a 25:1 ratio of unsuccessful attempts to FDA-approved medicines. Decades of research have provided limited treatment options for patients facing aggressive, late-stage forms of brain cancer. Although challenges persist, researchers continue to use past setbacks to inform future discoveries in brain cancer therapies.

ability to sleep and the daytime consequences of poor sleep, dis- torted beliefs and attitudes about the origins and meaning of the insomnia, maladaptive efforts to accommodate to the condition (e.g., schedule or lifestyle changes), and excessive time spent awake in bed. The latter behavior is of particular significance in that it often is associated with “trying hard” to fall asleep and growing frustration and tension in the face of wakefulness. Thus, the bed becomes associated with a state of waking arousal as this conditioning paradigm repeats itself night after night.

Insomnia occurs in individuals of all ages and races, and has been observed across all cultures and countries.8,9 The actual prevalence of insomnia varies according to the stringency of the definition used. Insomnia symptoms occur in approximately 33% to 50% of the adult population; insomnia symptoms with dis- tress or impairment (i.e., general insomnia disorder) in 10% to 15%; and specific insomnia disorders in 5% to 10%.10 Consis- tent risk factors for insomnia include increasing age, female sex, comorbid (medical, psychiatric, sleep, and substance use) disor- ders, shift work, and possibly unemployment and lower socio- economic status. Patients with comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions are at particularly increased risk, with psychiatric and chronic pain disorders having insomnia rates as high as 50% to 75%.11-13 The risk relationship between insomnia and psychiatric disorders appears to be bidirectional; several studies have also

Composite or combination flashings are typically less expensive than sheet metal and are easier to install. The most predominant type is a thin layer of metal sandwiched between one or two layers of another material. The metal layer is usually of aluminum, copper or lead. It is covered on one or both sides with various materials, such as asphalt coatings, kraft paper, fiberglass fabric or plastic films. Product literature should be reviewed to determine whether these materials are appropriate for use in brick masonry cavity walls. Consideration should be given to compatibility with adjacent sealants, delamination due to moisture penetration and movement of the wall system.

Phase 1. The aim of Phase 1 was to identify the contributions of clinical and laboratory variables that in practice were the most predictive of the decision to initiate DMARD therapy in a population of patients with early undifferentiated synovitis. Initiation of DMARD therapy was used as an indicator of the physician’s opinion that the patient was at risk of developing persistent and/or erosive arthritis that we would currently consider to be RA. Data on 3,115 patients from 9 early arthritis cohorts who were consid- ered not to have evidence of another possible diagnosis explaining their presentation were obtained. Between July 2007 and November 2008 an expert working group developed an analysis strategy that related an agreed- upon list of standardized clinical and laboratory vari- ables collected at baseline to the initiation of DMARD treatment within the next 12 months. MTX initiation was used as the gold standard for this purpose. The analytical process aimed to identify the independent contribution of each variable on this list and included univariate regression modeling, a subsequent principal components analysis, and a multivariate regression model that included all identified components (25). The resulting list of informative variables identified during that process and the weights based on the odds ratios are shown in Table 1. Phase 2. Phase 2 consisted of a consensus-based, decision science–informed approach, which took place between November 2008 and June 2009. The purpose of this phase was to derive a clinician-based judgment on

of care data [ 12 ] . The NCI estimate for expenditure on prostate cancer treatment in 2006 was $9.862 billion, and average Medicare payments per patient in the fi rst year after diagnosis were $11 000. It should be noted when interpreting this data that use of PSA testing for prostate cancer is more widespread in the USA than in many other countries, thus increasing the number of cases identifi ed. In addition, Medicare did not cover certain cancer care expenses such as oral medicines, commonly used to treat prostate cancer until January 2006. These out-of-pocket costs may comprise 10% of the $11 000 estimate. Direct medical expenditures are only one part of the total economic burden of cancer, as cancer- related illnesses and death lead to losses in economic productivity.

The numbers in each block are codes for the treatment given to each animal. The purpose of such a design is to reduce heterogeneity associated with time, space and some physical varia- tion. The five animals in Block 1 would be chosen to be as similar as possible with respect to age, weight, genotype and any other variable which might influence the outcome. They would then be assigned at random to one of the five treatments. The animals would be housed in close proximity, and possibly even in the same cage, if the different treatments can be given in such a situation. When measurements are to be made on the animals, those in Block 1 would be treated as a group, with all measurements being made within a short period by the same per- son. Animals in the other blocks would likewise be selected to be as uniform as possible, but might differ in body weight or age, etc. from those in Block 1. They could be measured at a dif- ferent time, if necessary by a different person. Thus, within each block any comparison among treatments would be made on animals which are in all possible ways as similar as possible. The unwanted variation shows up as differences between blocks. This is then removed mathe- matically in the statistical analysis.

For newer targeted cancer medicines, there are two additional areas of uncertainty. Firstly, despite their established mechanisms of action, targeted cancer medicines may not have clinically-meaningful activities against all tumours with a matching genetic mutation. To this point, a clinical trial has found that the progression-free survival of patients with metastatic solid tumour refractory to standard of care did not improve with the use of targeted therapies that matched with the tumour’s molecular profile but outside their approved indications, compared to patients who received treatment at the choice of their treating physicians (79). This means that targeted therapies should only be used according to approved indications and not based on identified molecular alternations or the general type of cancer.

The FDA recently recommended that a warning be issued regarding adverse effects associated with BzRA hypnotics. These medications have been associated with reports of disruptive sleep related behaviors including sleepwalking, eating, driving, and sexual behavior. Patients should be cautioned about the potential for these adverse effects, and about the importance of allowing appropriate sleep time, using only prescribed doses and avoiding the combination of BzRA hypnotics with alcohol, other sedatives, and sleep restriction.

Although, it was assumed that the 'thicker' articles with wider range of vocabulary is preferable in the editors hands, the editors (and probably the readers) prefer simple, clear and coherent writing, rather than a fancy or complex, pseudo-scientific style. Also Funkhouser and Maccoby (1971) showed that the information gain is especially enhanced by the “use of examples", i.e. it helps a lot to use some non-science material, such as everyday life parallels, historical points, etc. On the other hand, some sections, such as Introduction and Discussion, have to intrigue readers and attract interest and should therefore not be over-simplified. For example, a mysterious title can catch readers' attention and will be easily remembered (e.g.: T.Y. Li and J. Yorke named their famous paper on chaos: "The period three means chaos"). Some sections require more skill and are more important. It is approximated that from all published journal RAs in the world, only less than 5% are read in detail. However, more than 50% of abstracts are read and so the quality of an abstracts is much more important (Gordon, 1983). Therefore, the abstract should present the 'story' of the RA in miniature and should be readable standalone.

The statewide assessments in mathematics, reading, and science are used to measure whether students, and their school and district, are meeting the academic standards. Statewide assessments are one measure of how well students are doing on the content that is part of their daily instruction. It is also a measure of how well schools and districts are doing in aligning their curriculum and teaching the standards.

The increase in full-text downloads for open access articles during their first year after publication suggests that the primary benefit to the nonsubscriber commu- nity is in browsing, as opposed to printing or saving, which would have been indicated by a commensurate increase in PDF downloads. The decrease in abstract views suggests a reader preference for the full docu- ment when available.

Autorizo esse Banco a liquidar, à taxa do dia, as ordens de pagamento originárias do exterior que forem emitidas a seu cargo, em meu favor, transferindo o respectivo equivalente em moeda nacional para crédito em conta de minha titularidade por mim instruído neste formulário, deduzidas as despesas e tributos. Estou ciente de que se não houver ordem de pagamento liquidada na forma desta Autorização no período de 2 (dois) meses, ela será cancelada automaticamente. Por este meio, outorgo ao Banco do Brasil S.A. poderes para assinar, digitalmente ou pelo punho de funcionário de seu quadro e em meu nome, o contrato e/ou boleto de câmbio e outros documentos necessários à liquidação da operação correspondente, por mim contratada, caso não compareça para fazê-lo no prazo de 05 (cinco) dias úteis contados da data de sua contratação.
Reembolso é o ressarcimento das despesas decorrentes dos atendimentos ocorridos na área de abrangência geográfica da cobertura contratual sempre que não for possível a utilização dos serviços de prestadores da rede credenciada de cada plano. Para os planos que não possuem Livre Escolha (reembolso), os beneficiários deverão entrar em contato com o SAC buscando uma alternativa de atendimento no município onde o serviço ou o procedimento for demandado, desde que dentro da área de abrangência do Plano. O prazo para resposta é de até 7 (sete) dias úteis após a solicitação, caso não haja solução a Operadora concederá autorização de reembolso, sendo necessário apresentar o número de protocolo disponibilizado pela Central de Atendimento no contato inicial. Os beneficiários dos produtos 160 PLUS, 180 PLUS, 318 EXECUTIVO I e 318 EXECUTIVO II, poderão escolher qualquer prestador de serviços legalmente habilitado, que não sejam integrantes da rede credenciada para a realização dos procedimentos cobertos, ao qual pagará diretamente pelo serviço, solicitando posteriormente o reembolso, sendo que o ressarcimento dos valores obedecerá ao limite do plano contratado. O beneficiário titular declara que as informações constantes no pedido de reembolso são verdadeiras, estando ciente de que a não autenticidade dos documentos ou a omissão de qualquer informação, na tentativa de obter vantagem indevida, constitui fraude contra a Operadora, sujeito a perda do direito ao reembolso, cancelamento do plano de saúde e implicações judiciais, além de que o fato será imediatamente comunicado ao empregador (RH) e/ou representante legal da Pessoa Jurídica contratante do plano de saúde. As principais irregularidades não admitidas são: desdobramento de recibos; recibos de atendimento de pessoas diversas (não beneficiários do plano); recibos de atendimento de terceiros (ainda que conste o beneficiário como pagador); recibos falsos, adul- terados ou rasurados. Lembramos ainda que este rol não é taxativo, mas sim exemplificativo. A Operadora reserva-se no direito de contatar o prestador de serviços, emitente do recibo, sempre que julgar necessário, para comprovar e atestar a veracidade das informações. Para receber o reembolso é obrigatória a apresentação deste formulário devidamente preenchido, assim como a documentação exigida (check-list no verso) para cada tipo de serviço. A análise da solicitação e o reembolso serão efetuados no prazo de 30 dias a partir da data do recebimento da docu- mentação na Life Empresarial Saúde.

6. Identify the efflorescence. Knowing the composition of efflorescing salts is sometimes of use. Table 1, taken from Brownell’s report lists the most probable sources of efflorescing salts. Commercial testing laboratories can use X-ray diffraction, petrographic analysis or chemical analysis can, in some instances, determine both the type of salts present and their relative quantity. 7. Consider miscellaneous sources of water when all obvious sources have been eliminated. Some of these sources are: condensation within the wall, poorly directed landscape sprinklers, leaky pipes, faulty drains and condensation on heating or plumbing pipes. If necessary, condensation analysis methods are described in Technical Note 47.

The structural design of cavity walls should follow either rational or empirical methods. The rational design method is based on the properties of the wall materials and engineering analysis. This method may be used for any structure where high loads are likely or where tall walls are a necessity. The empirical method is generally satisfactory for one and two-story buildings consisting of light construction with limited floor spans and wall heights; and for multistory buildings where unsupported wall heights are not excessive.
medically related text and metadata features, such as “pa- tients,” “alzheimer,” “health information management,” and “medicine” are also important and of mostly positive polar- ity, since medical articles attract greater news coverage than, say, a recently published computer science paper. As we dis- cuss later, the presence of “alzheimer” as an important, neg- ative feature is more an artifact of the dataset than an iden- tification of trends in popularity. We also find an artifact of year (2016) of the dataset with the feature “zika virus,” due to the 2015-2016 zika epidemic in North and South Amer- ica. Three publishers appear in the top 20, the Massachusetts Medical Society, the publisher of the New England Journal ofMedicine,oneofthemostprestigiouspeer-reviewedmed- ical journals, “The Royal Society,” publisher of the less pres- tigious, but longest-running scientific journal, “Philosophi- cal Transactions of the Royal Society,” and “Elsevier,” one of the largest science publishers.

Wind turbines will be used to harness the kinetic energy of the moving air over the oceans on the OCS and convert it to electricity. Offshore winds are less turbulent (because the ocean is flat relative to onshore topography), and they tend to flow at higher speeds than onshore winds, thus allowing turbines to produce more electricity. Because the potential energy produced from the wind is directly proportional to the cube of the wind speed, increased wind speeds of only a few miles per hour can produce a significantly larger amount of electricity. For instance, a turbine at a site with an average wind speed of 16 mph would produce 50% more electricity than at a site with the same turbine and average wind speeds of 14 mph (Offshore Wind 2006).

One can reasonably assert that this beneficial anxiolytic effect might have been enhanced even further under three study design conditions. First, if the inclusion criteria had required each patient to have a high anxiety score prior to the procedure, for instance a minimum of 7 points (with 10 as the maximum), there would have been a greater potential for a difference pre-treatment vs. during the procedure. The six responders had a baseline average of 6.3 points, so there was room for improvement. Of the six responders, two subjects had low baseline anxiety scores (i.e., patient F at 4 points and patient I at 2 points). A higher baseline inclusion parameter could have increased the differential prior to vs. during the EMG procedure. Second, there might not have been a sufficiently long waiting period between the drug administration and the procedure. One can reasonably assert that if the time interval between dosing and the procedure was increased to a minimum of 30 minutes or more (from the 10 – 20 minutes), the percentage of responders and the magnitude of the response could have been greater. However, it should be noted that often in a clinic time-is-of-the-essence between the patient’s initial assessment by the medical provider and the subsequent medical procedure. Some medical providers are willing to pre-treat an anxious patient, typically with an oral benzodiazepine either swallowed intact or pre-dissolved in water, and then have him/her wait (e.g., 30 + min.) for an anxiolytic effect to be acknowledged by the patient. But, some physicians and dentists might be under time constraints or might not be willing to oblige the patient this waiting period. This would not be an obstacle if either the drug has a rapid onset of effect or the patient were to pre-treat themselves immediately prior to arrival at the physician’s office, for instance 30-60 minutes in advance. Even under the conditions of this study that the authors consider might have been sub-optimal, this drug combo delivered by the oral mucosal route provided a rapid onset effect as a PRN medication. This anxiolytic benefit may be useful in treating anticipatory anxiety either in-office or prior to arrival. There is a third limitation to this study to consider. The compounded medicine contained 25 mg of atenolol and 0.2 mg of scopolamine HBr.

receptor antagonist that affects the autonomic nervous system and reduces cardiovascular symptoms (e.g., tachycardia and hypertension) resulting from epinephrine in the circulation. Beta blockers interfere with receptor binding by catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine, of which epinephrine is the principal catecholamine affecting the cardiovascular symptoms. Propranolol is a lipophilic beta blocker that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, it can affect both somatic and CNS target tissues.

The numbers in each block are codes for the treatment given to each animal. The purpose of such a design is to reduce heterogeneity associated with time, space and some physical varia- tion. The five animals in Block 1 would be chosen to be as similar as possible with respect to age, weight, genotype and any other variable which might influence the outcome. They would then be assigned at random to one of the five treatments. The animals would be housed in close proximity, and possibly even in the same cage, if the different treatments can be given in such a situation. When measurements are to be made on the animals, those in Block 1 would be treated as a group, with all measurements being made within a short period by the same per- son. Animals in the other blocks would likewise be selected to be as uniform as possible, but might differ in body weight or age, etc. from those in Block 1. They could be measured at a dif- ferent time, if necessary by a different person. Thus, within each block any comparison among treatments would be made on animals which are in all possible ways as similar as possible. The unwanted variation shows up as differences between blocks. This is then removed mathe- matically in the statistical analysis.

of care data [ 12 ] . The NCI estimate for expenditure on prostate cancer treatment in 2006 was $9.862 billion, and average Medicare payments per patient in the fi rst year after diagnosis were $11 000. It should be noted when interpreting this data that use of PSA testing for prostate cancer is more widespread in the USA than in many other countries, thus increasing the number of cases identifi ed. In addition, Medicare did not cover certain cancer care expenses such as oral medicines, commonly used to treat prostate cancer until January 2006. These out-of-pocket costs may comprise 10% of the $11 000 estimate. Direct medical expenditures are only one part of the total economic burden of cancer, as cancer- related illnesses and death lead to losses in economic productivity.

Proper Sizing-Firebox dimensions should be selected so that the fire fills the combustion chamber during operation. This provides greater heating efficiency. Careful consideration should be given to size of the fireplace opening best suited for the room in which it is to be located. Location and size are important not only from the standpoint of appearance, but also of operation. If the fireplace opening is too small, it may function properly but will not produce enough heat to warm the room. If the opening is too large, a fire that would fill the combustion chamber may overwhelm the room. In such a case, the firebox opening would require a larger flue area and consume larger amounts of interior air even if exterior combustion air is provided. Table 2 provides suggested widths of conventional fireplace openings appropriate for various room sizes. For example, a room with 300 ft2 (28 m2) of floor area is best served by a fireplace with an opening 30 in. (750 mm) to 36 in. (900 mm) wide.

Your child has been identified as needing services for English Language Learners (ELL). Your child will be placed in the ESL/Bilingual Education dual language immersion program, as outlined in the attached document. We believe that this program will help meet your child’s educational needs and enhance his/her academic success in school. Your child will be assessed twice yearly, or as needed, to determine progress toward individual ELL goals. When your child scores in the acceptable range (4.5 Literacy/5.0 Overall) on all areas of the W-APT or ACCESS assessment they will be exited from the program. If your student currently has an Individualized Education Program (IEP), their needs will continue to be met through their current accommodations.

With some variation over time and across cancer types, care for the cancer population involves the six categories of services analyzed. The bars in Figures 2a-2c indicate that some patients had significant use of facility services in the year preceding the cancer diagnosis. For both colorectal and lung cancers, total spending on hospital inpatient increased as a percentage of total immediately following diagnosis. In all three cancers, the chemotherapy share of total spending increased rapidly in the first few months after diagnosis and, with the exception of breast cancer, continued at a fairly consistent level of around 20% of spending in subsequent years. Radiation therapy represented a small share of total spending except for breast cancer patients in the year following diagnosis.
receptor antagonist that affects the autonomic nervous system and reduces cardiovascular symptoms (e.g., tachycardia and hypertension) resulting from epinephrine in the circulation. Beta blockers interfere with receptor binding by catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine, of which epinephrine is the principal catecholamine affecting the cardiovascular symptoms. Propranolol is a lipophilic beta blocker that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, it can affect both somatic and CNS target tissues.

somnolence as a side effect is reproducible in susceptible individuals (White and Rumbold 1988). Sedation is a com- mon side effect of the traditional antipsychotics, with chlorpromazine and thioridazine somewhat more sedating than haloperidol. Clinical studies have shown a high inci- dence of persistent sedation with clozapine (46%) with less frequent reports of sedation with risperidone, olanzapine, sertindole and quetiapine (Monti et al. 2016). The sed- ation associated with these agents is most likely associated with their known effects on histaminic receptors. Doxepin, a sedating psychotropic agent with pro- nounced histamine (H-1) receptor antagonism exerts at least part of its effects by antagonizing orexin (Krystal et al. 2013). Suvorexant, is an orexin antagonist designed to lower waking arousal (Norman and Anderson 2016). Currently, it is being heavily marketed as a hypnotic (Rhyne and Anderson 2015). As based on performance and driving tests, this agent is known to produce a dose-related next day increase in somnolence for all age groupings tested (Farkus 2013). Sedative drug effects on daytime sleepiness are summarized in Table 4.

For the (2 vs. 2) SVM schema, one can observe from Table 6 that the highest overall accuracy is 0.91 and generated by a feature combination of POS-based unigrams and K-array semantics-based sequential features, regardless of whether WordNet is used to correct the POS of a unigram or not. In terms of the kernel functions, a linear kernel is used at the first level of the SVM model and a polynomial kernel at the second level. In addition, we notice that the inclusion of bigrams (the last four rows in Table 6) does not improve accuracy but rather reduce the accuracy. This agrees with results reported in previous studies. Tables 7 and 8 present the confusion matrices resulted from the two best feature sets using the (2 vs. 2) SVM schema. These two tables elaborate the two optimal feature sets as highlighted in Table 6. Results are obtained by using a linear and a polynomial kernel at the two levels respectively and averaged over 10-fold cross validation. Notice that in certain cases, the model cannot ditinguish between positive and neutral polarities due to the reasons discussed above; while negative and no-relationship can often be correctly identified.

the top 10. We also extract and treat as binary features four different types of subjects from Altmetric and CrossRef: Medline subject codes for journal (Altmetric), subjects as indexed by SCOPUS (Altmetric), publisher subjects (Altmetric), and CrossRef subjects. Subjects are mostly at the granularity of the journal or higher. Similar journals have subjects in com- mon, with, for instance, the journals Nature Conservation, Conservation Biology, Ecology and Evolution, and many more sharing the CrossRef subject “nature and landscape conservation.”Multidisciplinaryjournals,suchasPNASand Nature, are often tagged with more general subjects such as “science” or “multidisciplinary.” Table 2 displays the top 10 CrossRef subjects describing at least 100 articles by aver- age news coverage. As expected, health related subjects top the list, along with those related to the environment. Unfor- tunately, but as expected, “general computer science” and “computational mathematics” secured the last places, at 0.5 and 0.3 news articles on average, respectively. We also extract textual features, when available, for each document: Title, Abstract, Press Release. For scientific ar- ticles with more than one press release, we randomly select one. For each type of text document, we preprocess using a standard English stop word list, extracting counts of un- igrams and bigrams, keeping tokens which appear in more than one document and no more than 80% of documents of the same type in the training set. We keep the 30,000 most frequently occurring features in the training set. We then scale the vectors of counts by tfidf weights fit on the training set. Finally, we create a boolean feature hasPR indicating whether the scientific article received coverage on one of the two prominent press release aggregation websites, Eu- rekAlert! or Science Daily. We hypothesize that mention on one of these would expose the scientific article to more jour- nalists and thus garner more coverage.

the fact that 11 of the 12 medicines approved by the United States Food &amp; Drug Administration (US FDA) in 2012 for various cancer indications were priced above US$ 100 000 per year. The experts asserted that the prices of these medicines were too high, unsustainable, might compromise access of needy patients to highly effective therapy, and harmful to the sustainability of national health care systems (30). Similarly, in 2015, yet another group of cancer experts have petitioned for lower medicine prices (31).

1989). In the 1990’s newer agents were developed and marketed that had selective effects on GABA receptors in- cluding Zolpidem (Ambien), Zaleplon (Sonata), Eszopi- clone (Estorra) and Indiplon. While all hypnotics have abuse potential for individuals with addictive histories and personalities, these agents have been noted to have min- imal additive potential (Hajak et al. 2003). These agents are less likely to have deleterious side effects than most OTC treatments for insomnia, however, with increased use, more side effects including next effects on driving have been reported. This effect as well as next day re- bound insomnia has particularly been reported for higher doses of zolpidem (Verster et al. 2002). In many cases, MVA’s occurred in the period of somnolence and cogni- tive impairment during the first few hours after ingestion. Comparatively normal results on psychomotor tests can be obtained 3.25 h. after zaleplon ingestion and 6.25 h. after zopiclone ingestion (Paul et al. 2003). While these agents have excellent efficacy with minimal side effects, at higher doses these agents can exhibit benzodiazepine-like effects. Idiosyncratic reactions of persistent daytime som- nolence and/or memory loss have been reported. Some patients will report next day sedation after the nighttime use of these agents, as well as demonstrate an increased error rate in driving tests (Verster et al. 2007). Such infor- mation was forthcoming only after these drugs became generic and widely utilized in clinical practice. Most sedat- ing drugs if adopted into such widespread use would also be at least as likely to demonstrate epidemiological effects on MVA’s and MVA associated deaths. In the elderly, chronic use of sedating drugs (particularly those with anti-cholinergic side effects) can be associated with an increased risk for falls, and confusion (American Geriatrics Society 2015). Reported next day sleepiness and other side effects associated with hypnotic use are summarized in Table 3. The newer GABA-effective hypnotics are the only medications with demonstrated effectiveness in treating chronic insomnia (NIH State of the Science Conference

samples)) / (geometric mean cpm of no drug samples). Percentage reductions are used to plot percentage inhibition of growth as a function of drug concentrations. IC 50 values are determined by linear regression analyses on the linear segments of the curves (IC 90 values can also be determined by curve-fitting and can provide an useful measure of variation between experiments). Assays are typically repeated on two or three separate occasions. Within each experiment, standard deviations are typically less than 10% of the mean. Differences in parasite stages of development can lead to up to two-fold shifts in the IC 50 values between experiments; however, these differences rarely affect the overall relationships between the parasite lines in terms of their differences in drug response 4-11 .

• Fatigue and sleepiness. Feelings of fatigue (low energy, physical tiredness, weariness) are more common than symptoms of sleepiness (actual tendency to fall asleep) in patients with chronic insomnia. The presence of significant sleepiness should prompt a search for other potential sleep disorders. The number, duration, and timing of naps should be thoroughly investigated, as both a consequence of in- somnia and a potential contributing factor.

Having your child in quarantine does not require any restrictions with other household members unless your child is experiencing COVID-19 symptoms or has tested positive for COVID-19. If your child develops symptoms or tests positive, household members should also quarantine and await further instruction from public health.
Clinicians should individualise adjustments based on patient-specific symptoms, symptom severity, academic demands, as well as pre-existing conditions, such as mood disorder, learning disability or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.87 88 Athletes with complicated or prolonged recovery may require a multidisciplinary team with specific expertise across the scope of concussion management.
Results from the tests showed that the average value of critical thinking ability to the average achievement after the testing ended, showed the relationship was statistically significant (.05). As a result, the researchers compared the results of Table 4 and determined that after the posttest, data showed the average of critical thinking ability and post-learning achievement were higher than before the study.

When analyzing the data, we found that there does not exist a CUI de(cid:2)nition for a large number of pos- sible concepts. Table 5 shows the number of words in the CUI and ST de(cid:2)nitions for each concept in the NLM-WSD dataset. Only four target words have a CUI de(cid:2)nition for each possible concept. We also found the concept de(cid:2)nitions vary widely in length. The CUI de(cid:2)nitions in the UMLS come from a va- riety of sources and there may exist more than one de(cid:2)nition per source. Unlike CUI de(cid:2)nitions, there does exist an ST de(cid:2)nition for each possible con- cept. The ST de(cid:2)nitions come from the same source and are approximately the same length but they are a broad categorization. We believe this makes them too coarse grained to provide descriptive enough in- formation about their associated concepts.

Effective immediately, hospitals shall notify an EMS provider if a patient transported to the hospital by that provider’s EMS crew subsequently tests positive for the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus. Notification must occur within 48 hours of the positive test result. This is a change from the previous 12-hour notification requirement. Notification of a positive test result is required regardless of whether CDC’s recommended use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during transport of any individual with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 was observed. Notification shall not include the name of the patient who tested positive.

President Obama has recently expressed a strong conviction that “Science offers great potential for improving health”. The President has announced a research initiative that aims to accelerate progress toward a new era of precision medicine. The time is accurate for this idealistic initiative, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other partners will work to attain this vision [7]. The concept of precision medicine speaks of prevention and treatment strategies that take individual variability into account. Even though it is not new, the impact of practicality is still deprived. If one considers blood typing, for instance, has been used to guide blood transfusions for more than a century. But the vision of applying this concept broadly has been intensely improved by the latest development of large-scale biologic databases (such as the human genome sequence), powerful methods for typifying patients (such as proteomics, metabolomics, genomics, diverse cellular assays, and even mobile health technology), and computational tools for analyzing large sets of data. Francis S.Collins et al. stated that, “What is necessary now is a broad

Concrete masonry units are usually used for the interior wythe of a cavity wall in combination with a brick masonry exterior. They may also be used as accent bands in the exterior brick wythe. Hollow or solid concrete masonry units should conform to ASTM C 55 Specification for Concrete Building Brick, ASTM C 90 Specification for Loadbearing Concrete Masonry Units or ASTM C 129 Specification for Non-Loadbearing Concrete Masonry Units. Non load- bearing concrete masonry units are usually specified for the interior wythe when the brick and block cavity wall is used as infill walls for concrete or steel frame structural systems if shear loads are not transmitted to that wythe.

O ceratocone, a degeneração marginal pelúcida e ectasia pós-cirurgia refrativa são doenças que causam afilamento e abaulamento da córnea (estrutura transparente que forma a parede anterior do globo ocular). Estas alterações provocam astigmatismo irregular com distorção visual importante. O grau de embaçamento visual vai depender do grau de astigmatismo produzido e da existência de outras alterações oculares associadas. Astigmatismo pós-transplante de córnea é um grau residual que ocorre dependendo da intera- ção entre córnea doada e receptor (coaptação, cicatrização, abertura e frouxidão de pontos no decorrer da cicatrização e sua retirada).

What is the purpose of a RA and what makes it a good one, and who decides that it is a good RA? Are there rules for easier writing? If the main function of a RA is to transfer a new knowledge on a research topic, then a good paper is the one that is clear, coherent, focused, well argued and uses language that does not have ambiguous or equivoque meaning. However, it is not only the message that is important. The RA must have a well-defined structure and function in serve like a cook-book, so the others can reproduce and repeat explained experiments. Answer research questions Give summary conclusions There are some rules that can make the writing and publishing of RAs 'easier'. Here, we summarised some 'golden' rules that should always be in the mind of an inexperienced researcher (Table 3). We put all these together to make a final list of some 40 logical steps, which can be find in the Appendix.

Profit control is an effective measure to manage medicine prices insofar as the regulators have control over the supply of medicines at certain points along the supply chain. Typically, this means that the regulator needs to have full visibility of the supply and distribution chains. The regulator also needs to have the capacity and ability to enforce non-compliance. Profit control is most effective when there is a publicly- funded universal programme for the provision of medicines. In contrast, it may be much less effective in health care settings where the private sector plays a significant role in the delivery of medicines, or where the structure of supply chain is complex or under-developed (183).

Participants also discovered that all RAS's can be separated in subsections or signposts, which can be arbitrary, but improve the structure of a RA. The recognized subsections were: research topic and definitions, research objectives (questions), methodological techniques, experimental set-up, object of the study (e.g. study area), main discoveries (analysed data), answers on research questions, explanation of the conclusions and further research and implications. The main RAS's are listed in a flow chart, showing main relations between different sections (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 shows the substructure of Introduction and Discussion RAS as the most important RAS's.

Wind turbines will be used to harness the kinetic energy of the moving air over the oceans on the OCS and convert it to electricity. Offshore winds are less turbulent (because the ocean is flat relative to onshore topography), and they tend to flow at higher speeds than onshore winds, thus allowing turbines to produce more electricity. Because the potential energy produced from the wind is directly proportional to the cube of the wind speed, increased wind speeds of only a few miles per hour can produce a significantly larger amount of electricity. For instance, a turbine at a site with an average wind speed of 16 mph would produce 50% more electricity than at a site with the same turbine and average wind speeds of 14 mph (Offshore Wind 2006).

The numbers in each block are codes for the treatment given to each animal. The purpose of such a design is to reduce heterogeneity associated with time, space and some physical varia- tion. The five animals in Block 1 would be chosen to be as similar as possible with respect to age, weight, genotype and any other variable which might influence the outcome. They would then be assigned at random to one of the five treatments. The animals would be housed in close proximity, and possibly even in the same cage, if the different treatments can be given in such a situation. When measurements are to be made on the animals, those in Block 1 would be treated as a group, with all measurements being made within a short period by the same per- son. Animals in the other blocks would likewise be selected to be as uniform as possible, but might differ in body weight or age, etc. from those in Block 1. They could be measured at a dif- ferent time, if necessary by a different person. Thus, within each block any comparison among treatments would be made on animals which are in all possible ways as similar as possible. The unwanted variation shows up as differences between blocks. This is then removed mathe- matically in the statistical analysis.

In summary, public and non-profit-making sectors, and by extension tax-payers and philanthropists, have provided considerable financial and non-financial contributions towards the R&amp;D of cancer medicines. This means that in many cases, pharmaceutical companies have not incurred the full costs of R&amp;D. The pharmaceutical industry has also benefited greatly from the knowledge generated by public-sector investments in R&amp;D, and by having access to research supported by public funding at costs, if any, lower than the market value.

The goals of treatment are to “cure” the cancer, if possible; pro- long survival; and provide the highest possible quality of life during and after treatment. A cancer is cured when all traces of the cancer have been removed from the patient’s body. Although it is usually not possible to know if the cancer is completely eradicated, for many patients, the initial course of therapy is successful and the cancer never returns. However, some cancer- free survivors must cope with the long-term effects of treatment, as well as psychological concerns such as fear of recurrence. Cancer patients, caregivers, and survivors must have the infor- mation and support they need to play an active role in decisions that affect treatment and quality of life.
Canada has a national stopgap to protect consumers from price gouging. The Patient Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB), a consumer protection agency, has the authority to impose sanctions and price reductions for patented products deemed excessively priced. However, the PMPRB is hobbled in its ability to keep Canada’s drug spending low.
The FDA recently recommended that a warning be issued regarding adverse effects associated with BzRA hypnotics. These medications have been associated with reports of disruptive sleep related behaviors including sleepwalking, eating, driving, and sexual behavior. Patients should be cautioned about the potential for these adverse effects, and about the importance of allowing appropriate sleep time, using only prescribed doses and avoiding the combination of BzRA hypnotics with alcohol, other sedatives, and sleep restriction.

Although, it was assumed that the 'thicker' articles with wider range of vocabulary is preferable in the editors hands, the editors (and probably the readers) prefer simple, clear and coherent writing, rather than a fancy or complex, pseudo-scientific style. Also Funkhouser and Maccoby (1971) showed that the information gain is especially enhanced by the “use of examples", i.e. it helps a lot to use some non-science material, such as everyday life parallels, historical points, etc. On the other hand, some sections, such as Introduction and Discussion, have to intrigue readers and attract interest and should therefore not be over-simplified. For example, a mysterious title can catch readers' attention and will be easily remembered (e.g.: T.Y. Li and J. Yorke named their famous paper on chaos: "The period three means chaos"). Some sections require more skill and are more important. It is approximated that from all published journal RAs in the world, only less than 5% are read in detail. However, more than 50% of abstracts are read and so the quality of an abstracts is much more important (Gordon, 1983). Therefore, the abstract should present the 'story' of the RA in miniature and should be readable standalone.

Brick has been used to create beautiful buildings for centuries. Most of these structures have a substantial history of outstanding performance. In some instances the appearance is affected by the development of efflorescence or stains. These may originate from materials in the brick or mortar, from adjacent materials, and from outside sourc- es such as cleaning agents. Each has a particular chemical composition and a unique means of removal.

Phase 1. The aim of Phase 1 was to identify the contributions of clinical and laboratory variables that in practice were the most predictive of the decision to initiate DMARD therapy in a population of patients with early undifferentiated synovitis. Initiation of DMARD therapy was used as an indicator of the physician’s opinion that the patient was at risk of developing persistent and/or erosive arthritis that we would currently consider to be RA. Data on 3,115 patients from 9 early arthritis cohorts who were consid- ered not to have evidence of another possible diagnosis explaining their presentation were obtained. Between July 2007 and November 2008 an expert working group developed an analysis strategy that related an agreed- upon list of standardized clinical and laboratory vari- ables collected at baseline to the initiation of DMARD treatment within the next 12 months. MTX initiation was used as the gold standard for this purpose. The analytical process aimed to identify the independent contribution of each variable on this list and included univariate regression modeling, a subsequent principal components analysis, and a multivariate regression model that included all identified components (25). The resulting list of informative variables identified during that process and the weights based on the odds ratios are shown in Table 1. Phase 2. Phase 2 consisted of a consensus-based, decision science–informed approach, which took place between November 2008 and June 2009. The purpose of this phase was to derive a clinician-based judgment on

Your child has been identified as needing services for English Language Learners (ELL). Your child will be placed in the ESL/Bilingual Education dual language immersion program, as outlined in the attached document. We believe that this program will help meet your child’s educational needs and enhance his/her academic success in school. Your child will be assessed twice yearly, or as needed, to determine progress toward individual ELL goals. When your child scores in the acceptable range (4.5 Literacy/5.0 Overall) on all areas of the W-APT or ACCESS assessment they will be exited from the program. If your student currently has an Individualized Education Program (IEP), their needs will continue to be met through their current accommodations.

OOP costs in the year of diagnosis came mostly from professional and non-inpatient facility services. Figure 8 shows the level of OOP costs by percentile for all study cancers combined. In general, patient cost-sharing is higher for out-of-network services than in-network. Not surprisingly, cancer patients in the highest decile of OOP spending also incurred the highest portion of OOP costs for out- of-network providers; conversely, patients in the lowest decile incurred the lowest portion of OOP costs for out-of-network providers.

Based on the size of the flue selected, a preliminary damper size must be assumed. At this point in the design process, it is only necessary to decide if the damper throat area to be used will be equal to or twice the flue area. Once this decision has been made the Inlet Loss Coefficient, K 2, may be determined. If the damper throat area is equal to the flue area, K 2 is equal to 2.5. If the damper throat is twice the flue area, K 2 is equal to 1.0.

In the future, we would also like to increase the size of our con(cid:3)ated dataset and possibly create a biomedical all-words disambiguation test set to test our approach. Unlike SenseClusters, our approach can be used to perform all-words disambiguation. For example, given the sentence: His weight has fluctuated during the past month. We (cid:2)rst create a instance vector containing fluctuated, past and months for the word weight and a concept vector for each of its possible concepts, (cid:147)C0005912: Body Weight(cid:148) and (cid:147)C0699807: Quantitative Concept(cid:148) us- ing their context descriptions. We then calculate the cosine between the instance vector and each of the two concept vectors. The concept whose vector has the smallest cosine score is assigned to weight. We then repeat this process for fluctuated, past and months. We also plan to explore using different contex- tual information to improve the accuracy of our approach. We are currently exploring using co- occurrence and relational information about the pos- sible CUIs in the UMLS. Our IDF stoplist exper-

1989). In the 1990’s newer agents were developed and marketed that had selective effects on GABA receptors in- cluding Zolpidem (Ambien), Zaleplon (Sonata), Eszopi- clone (Estorra) and Indiplon. While all hypnotics have abuse potential for individuals with addictive histories and personalities, these agents have been noted to have min- imal additive potential (Hajak et al. 2003). These agents are less likely to have deleterious side effects than most OTC treatments for insomnia, however, with increased use, more side effects including next effects on driving have been reported. This effect as well as next day re- bound insomnia has particularly been reported for higher doses of zolpidem (Verster et al. 2002). In many cases, MVA’s occurred in the period of somnolence and cogni- tive impairment during the first few hours after ingestion. Comparatively normal results on psychomotor tests can be obtained 3.25 h. after zaleplon ingestion and 6.25 h. after zopiclone ingestion (Paul et al. 2003). While these agents have excellent efficacy with minimal side effects, at higher doses these agents can exhibit benzodiazepine-like effects. Idiosyncratic reactions of persistent daytime som- nolence and/or memory loss have been reported. Some patients will report next day sedation after the nighttime use of these agents, as well as demonstrate an increased error rate in driving tests (Verster et al. 2007). Such infor- mation was forthcoming only after these drugs became generic and widely utilized in clinical practice. Most sedat- ing drugs if adopted into such widespread use would also be at least as likely to demonstrate epidemiological effects on MVA’s and MVA associated deaths. In the elderly, chronic use of sedating drugs (particularly those with anti-cholinergic side effects) can be associated with an increased risk for falls, and confusion (American Geriatrics Society 2015). Reported next day sleepiness and other side effects associated with hypnotic use are summarized in Table 3. The newer GABA-effective hypnotics are the only medications with demonstrated effectiveness in treating chronic insomnia (NIH State of the Science Conference

The TSST method has been used to study the effects of oral propranolol in volunteer subjects [25-28]. The assessments of psychic anxiety can be assessed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) or other similar tools [29,30]. The somatic and psychic effects of oral propranolol were tested using the TSST method in healthy adult volunteers. Propranolol (40 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, reduced systolic blood pressure, and enhanced cognitive flexibility during stress. In another study propranolol (80 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, but paradoxically increased salivary cortisol, and did not significantly affect BP or subjective stress [25]. But, in another TSST study daily oral propranolol (80 mg) did not affect the salivary cortisol response [27].

somnolence as a side effect is reproducible in susceptible individuals (White and Rumbold 1988). Sedation is a com- mon side effect of the traditional antipsychotics, with chlorpromazine and thioridazine somewhat more sedating than haloperidol. Clinical studies have shown a high inci- dence of persistent sedation with clozapine (46%) with less frequent reports of sedation with risperidone, olanzapine, sertindole and quetiapine (Monti et al. 2016). The sed- ation associated with these agents is most likely associated with their known effects on histaminic receptors. Doxepin, a sedating psychotropic agent with pro- nounced histamine (H-1) receptor antagonism exerts at least part of its effects by antagonizing orexin (Krystal et al. 2013). Suvorexant, is an orexin antagonist designed to lower waking arousal (Norman and Anderson 2016). Currently, it is being heavily marketed as a hypnotic (Rhyne and Anderson 2015). As based on performance and driving tests, this agent is known to produce a dose-related next day increase in somnolence for all age groupings tested (Farkus 2013). Sedative drug effects on daytime sleepiness are summarized in Table 4.

There are debates about whether the returns generated from the sales of medicines, including cancer medicines, are sufficient for pharmaceutical companies to cover their past R&amp;D expenses, maintain their operations and engage in future drug discovery research. For example, some commentators have observed that the revenue generated from the sales of imatinib had exceeded the costs of R&amp;D within two years and “the revenues over the subsequent years of the patent would represent generous profits to the company” (30). Another study found that total revenue from the sales of 10 cancer medicines since approval over a median of four years (US$ 67.0 billion) was 9.3 times the total R&amp;D spending of US$ 7.2 billion (or 7.4 times using an estimated risk-adjusted R&amp;D costs of US$ 9.1 billion) (94).

The use of two antimalarials simultaneously, especially when the antimalarials have different mechanisms of action, has the potential for inhib- iting the development of resistance to either of the components. The efficacy of a combination of a 4-aminoquinoline drug (either chloroquine or amo- diaquine) with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine has been reviewed (43). The results of this review sug- gested that the addition of either chloroquine or amodiaquine to SP marginally improved parasitological clearance (compared with SP alone). The studies reviewed were mostly done in areas and at times when both SP and chloroquine/amodi- aquine retained a fair amount of efficacy, and it is not clear from these studies how well such a combination would act in areas where one of the components was significantly compromised. Additionally, to date, there are no data to suggest whether this slightly improved clearance would

The temperature change used for estimating thermal movements should be based on mean temperatures in the component. For solid masonry walls, tempera- tures at the center of the wall should be used. In cav- ity walls and veneers, the temperature at the center of each wythe or component should be used. In dis- continuous construction, the wythes will have different temperatures due to the separation of the wythes by an air space and perhaps insulation.

(cid:2) The panel recommends that clinicians offer multi- modal analgesia, or the use of a variety of analgesic medications and techniques combined with non- pharmacological interventions, for the treatment of postoperative pain in children and adults (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Multimodal analgesia, defined as the use of a variety of analgesic medication and techniques that target different mechanisms of action in the peripheral and/or central nervous system (which might also be combined with nonpharmacological interventions) might have ad- ditiveorsynergisticeffectsandmoreeffectivepainrelief compared with single-modality interventions. For example, clinicians might offer local anesthetic-based regional (peripheral and neuraxial) analgesic techniques in combination with systemic opioids and other analge- sics as part of a multimodal approach to perioperative pain. Because of the availability of effective nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies for postop- erative pain management, the panel suggests that clini- cians routinely incorporate around the clock nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies into multi- modal analgesia regimens. Systemic opioids might not be required in all patients. One study suggests that it shouldbeavoidedwhennotneeded,becauselimitedev- idence suggests that perioperative opioid therapy might be associated with increased likelihood of long-term opioid use, with its attendant risks.4

concussion tests. If it is clear an athlete has an SRC, additional sideline testing can be discontinued. Sport-specific rules may not allow adequate time for evaluation, and modifying these rules remains an area for improvement within the governing bodies of some sports. (C) When the sports medicine clinician becomes aware of a poten- tial injury, the athlete is approached and a brief history of the event is obtained from the athlete and those who witnessed the event or athlete behaviour. How the athlete responds to the elements of orientation, memory, concentration and balance is evaluated, as well as speech patterns and how the athlete appears to be processing information. Cervical palpation and range of motion (ROM) are also typically performed to assess for other

1. Brief description of your research project:
prices of pharmaceuticals grew faster than the collective prices of all goods and services (Fig. 4.6a, p.61). However, the trends in the two countries began to diverge in the late 1980s where the price level of medicines continued to rise faster in the USA, while the growth rate of pharmaceutical prices in Australia seemed to have been stabilized at around 10% higher than the consumer price index. This could possibly be due to the introduction of “cost effectiveness” as a requirement before listing a medicine on the national pharmaceutical insurance scheme, so as to ensure the benefits of a given medicine were high enough to justify the price requested by the manufacturer (246). The divergence became more prominent when the Australian Government undertook further reforms of its national scheme after 2005 (247), which was implemented in response to a report that warned “in 40 years’ time, the PBS could account for 3.4% of GDP, making it the largest part of the Government’s spending on health” (248). The reforms seem to have resulted in gradual normalization of the growth rate of medicine prices in Australia to a level in line with the overall inflation rate of other consumer goods (Fig. 4.6a). In contrast, medicine prices continued to grow considerably in the USA, with the cumulative growth reaching 2.4 times the overall inflation rate of other consumer goods in 2017. Of note, the price level of prescription medicines in the USA rose in parallel with Pricing and reimbursement policies in Australia over four decades have controlled the growth rate of medicine prices.

Based on the size of the flue selected, a preliminary damper size must be assumed. At this point in the design process, it is only necessary to decide if the damper throat area to be used will be equal to or twice the flue area. Once this decision has been made the Inlet Loss Coefficient, K 2, may be determined. If the damper throat area is equal to the flue area, K 2 is equal to 2.5. If the damper throat is twice the flue area, K 2 is equal to 1.0.
Composite or combination flashings are typically less expensive than sheet metal and are easier to install. The most predominant type is a thin layer of metal sandwiched between one or two layers of another material. The metal layer is usually of aluminum, copper or lead. It is covered on one or both sides with various materials, such as asphalt coatings, kraft paper, fiberglass fabric or plastic films. Product literature should be reviewed to determine whether these materials are appropriate for use in brick masonry cavity walls. Consideration should be given to compatibility with adjacent sealants, delamination due to moisture penetration and movement of the wall system.

Rectal cancer patients require a colostomy more often than colon cancer patients (29% versus 12%, respectively).82 A permanent colos- tomy may be required if the anus and the sphincter muscle are removed during surgery.
The structural design of cavity walls should follow either rational or empirical methods. The rational design method is based on the properties of the wall materials and engineering analysis. This method may be used for any structure where high loads are likely or where tall walls are a necessity. The empirical method is generally satisfactory for one and two-story buildings consisting of light construction with limited floor spans and wall heights; and for multistory buildings where unsupported wall heights are not excessive.

In the future, we would also like to increase the size of our con(cid:3)ated dataset and possibly create a biomedical all-words disambiguation test set to test our approach. Unlike SenseClusters, our approach can be used to perform all-words disambiguation. For example, given the sentence: His weight has fluctuated during the past month. We (cid:2)rst create a instance vector containing fluctuated, past and months for the word weight and a concept vector for each of its possible concepts, (cid:147)C0005912: Body Weight(cid:148) and (cid:147)C0699807: Quantitative Concept(cid:148) us- ing their context descriptions. We then calculate the cosine between the instance vector and each of the two concept vectors. The concept whose vector has the smallest cosine score is assigned to weight. We then repeat this process for fluctuated, past and months. We also plan to explore using different contex- tual information to improve the accuracy of our approach. We are currently exploring using co- occurrence and relational information about the pos- sible CUIs in the UMLS. Our IDF stoplist exper-

The strength and moisture penetration resistance of a brick masonry cavity wall are affected by the mortar selection and compatibility with the brick units. Portland cement-lime, mortar cement, or masonry cement mortars can be used. However, mortars with an air content less than 12 percent are recommended for their superior bond strength and resistance to moisture penetration. The MSJC Code requires that the allowable flexural tensile stresses be reduced by approximately 50 percent for assemblies constructed with masonry cement mortars or portland cement-lime mortars that have air entrainment. In addition, some building codes prohibit the use of masonry cement mortars and all Type N mortars in Seismic Performance Categories D and E (formerly Seismic Zones 3 and 4). Mortar should meet the proportion requirements of ASTM C 270 Specification for Mortar for Unit Masonry as shown in Table 1. Mortar type selection should be based on project requirements, such as strength and compatibility with a particular brick unit. Types N or S mortars are typically used in brick masonry cavity walls. See Technical Notes 8 Series for more detailed information on mortar types and selection.

The goals of treatment are to “cure” the cancer, if possible; pro- long survival; and provide the highest possible quality of life during and after treatment. A cancer is cured when all traces of the cancer have been removed from the patient’s body. Although it is usually not possible to know if the cancer is completely eradicated, for many patients, the initial course of therapy is successful and the cancer never returns. However, some cancer- free survivors must cope with the long-term effects of treatment, as well as psychological concerns such as fear of recurrence. Cancer patients, caregivers, and survivors must have the infor- mation and support they need to play an active role in decisions that affect treatment and quality of life.

Phase 1. The aim of Phase 1 was to identify the contributions of clinical and laboratory variables that in practice were the most predictive of the decision to initiate DMARD therapy in a population of patients with early undifferentiated synovitis. Initiation of DMARD therapy was used as an indicator of the physician’s opinion that the patient was at risk of developing persistent and/or erosive arthritis that we would currently consider to be RA. Data on 3,115 patients from 9 early arthritis cohorts who were consid- ered not to have evidence of another possible diagnosis explaining their presentation were obtained. Between July 2007 and November 2008 an expert working group developed an analysis strategy that related an agreed- upon list of standardized clinical and laboratory vari- ables collected at baseline to the initiation of DMARD treatment within the next 12 months. MTX initiation was used as the gold standard for this purpose. The analytical process aimed to identify the independent contribution of each variable on this list and included univariate regression modeling, a subsequent principal components analysis, and a multivariate regression model that included all identified components (25). The resulting list of informative variables identified during that process and the weights based on the odds ratios are shown in Table 1. Phase 2. Phase 2 consisted of a consensus-based, decision science–informed approach, which took place between November 2008 and June 2009. The purpose of this phase was to derive a clinician-based judgment on

This section of the form is utilized to give third party organizations permission to verbally speak and electronically receive academic and financial student information from National University (NU), for the purpose of providing, maintaining, and/or administering Tuition Scholarships and other corporate benefits. This information includes personal information such as student name, Student ID, school status, document status and Organization name, financial information related to billing, financial aid, account balances, account statements, payments due and benefits earned, and academic information including but not limited to grades, credits attempted/earned, GPA, unsuccessful grades, program, start date, course names, and period of attendance.
Dose ranging test: Here, compounds are tested at a minimum of 4 different doses (the “dose ranging, full 4-day test”, typically 100, 30, 10 and 3 mg/kg, by both s.c. and p.o. routes of administration). ED 50 and ED 90 values are calculated by plotting the log dose against probit activity (for example, using Microcal “Origin”). These reflect the drug concentrations at which 50% and 90% of suppression of parasitemia is achieved. Note that with short half-life drugs it may be necessary to dose multiple times per day. Two other parameters measured in this study are relative potency compared to an appropriate standard drug, and oral bioavailability (assessed by comparison of oral and parenteral administration).

Although, it was assumed that the 'thicker' articles with wider range of vocabulary is preferable in the editors hands, the editors (and probably the readers) prefer simple, clear and coherent writing, rather than a fancy or complex, pseudo-scientific style. Also Funkhouser and Maccoby (1971) showed that the information gain is especially enhanced by the “use of examples", i.e. it helps a lot to use some non-science material, such as everyday life parallels, historical points, etc. On the other hand, some sections, such as Introduction and Discussion, have to intrigue readers and attract interest and should therefore not be over-simplified. For example, a mysterious title can catch readers' attention and will be easily remembered (e.g.: T.Y. Li and J. Yorke named their famous paper on chaos: "The period three means chaos"). Some sections require more skill and are more important. It is approximated that from all published journal RAs in the world, only less than 5% are read in detail. However, more than 50% of abstracts are read and so the quality of an abstracts is much more important (Gordon, 1983). Therefore, the abstract should present the 'story' of the RA in miniature and should be readable standalone.

The DO Difference:
For newer targeted cancer medicines, there are two additional areas of uncertainty. Firstly, despite their established mechanisms of action, targeted cancer medicines may not have clinically-meaningful activities against all tumours with a matching genetic mutation. To this point, a clinical trial has found that the progression-free survival of patients with metastatic solid tumour refractory to standard of care did not improve with the use of targeted therapies that matched with the tumour’s molecular profile but outside their approved indications, compared to patients who received treatment at the choice of their treating physicians (79). This means that targeted therapies should only be used according to approved indications and not based on identified molecular alternations or the general type of cancer.

Based on the size of the flue selected, a preliminary damper size must be assumed. At this point in the design process, it is only necessary to decide if the damper throat area to be used will be equal to or twice the flue area. Once this decision has been made the Inlet Loss Coefficient, K 2, may be determined. If the damper throat area is equal to the flue area, K 2 is equal to 2.5. If the damper throat is twice the flue area, K 2 is equal to 1.0.

ability to sleep and the daytime consequences of poor sleep, dis- torted beliefs and attitudes about the origins and meaning of the insomnia, maladaptive efforts to accommodate to the condition (e.g., schedule or lifestyle changes), and excessive time spent awake in bed. The latter behavior is of particular significance in that it often is associated with “trying hard” to fall asleep and growing frustration and tension in the face of wakefulness. Thus, the bed becomes associated with a state of waking arousal as this conditioning paradigm repeats itself night after night.

In this paper, we describe a novel feature space designed to effectively classify the polarity and strength of relationships extracted from biomedical abstracts. In addition to the conventional syntactic features such as unigrams and bigrams, we have also explored and constructed semantics-based sequential features. These features are constructed at three different levels: entity, phrase, and sentence. A wrapper-based method is then used to select the optimal feature sets for both polarity and strength prediction. Specifically, a multi-stage SVM classifier and an SVR predictor are built for polarity and strength prediction, respectively. Two different schemas, namely, (1 vs. all) and (2 vs. 2), are employed to build the multi-stage SVM. Finally, three different kernel functions are considered at different stage of this SVM classifier. Our intensive evaluations have shown that for polarity prediction, the (2 vs. 2) schema in general works better than the (1 vs. all). It produces the highest polarity accuracy of 0.91 when both unigrams and semantics-based sequential structures (KSS) are used, with a standard error ranging between 0.01~0.02. On the other hand, we find that for strength prediction, unigrams solely can produce satisfying results. We obtain a high accuracy of 0.96, with the standard error ranging between 0.61%~0.63% for the strength analysis. We are currently expanding our annotated corpus to facilitate further validation of the findings reported in this work. We are also integrating this module with other modules as shown in Figure 1 towards building a quantitative food-disease-gene network. Finally, we are creating an interactive user interface to visually present this network.

The numbers in each block are codes for the treatment given to each animal. The purpose of such a design is to reduce heterogeneity associated with time, space and some physical varia- tion. The five animals in Block 1 would be chosen to be as similar as possible with respect to age, weight, genotype and any other variable which might influence the outcome. They would then be assigned at random to one of the five treatments. The animals would be housed in close proximity, and possibly even in the same cage, if the different treatments can be given in such a situation. When measurements are to be made on the animals, those in Block 1 would be treated as a group, with all measurements being made within a short period by the same per- son. Animals in the other blocks would likewise be selected to be as uniform as possible, but might differ in body weight or age, etc. from those in Block 1. They could be measured at a dif- ferent time, if necessary by a different person. Thus, within each block any comparison among treatments would be made on animals which are in all possible ways as similar as possible. The unwanted variation shows up as differences between blocks. This is then removed mathe- matically in the statistical analysis.

The goals of treatment are to “cure” the cancer, if possible; pro- long survival; and provide the highest possible quality of life during and after treatment. A cancer is cured when all traces of the cancer have been removed from the patient’s body. Although it is usually not possible to know if the cancer is completely eradicated, for many patients, the initial course of therapy is successful and the cancer never returns. However, some cancer- free survivors must cope with the long-term effects of treatment, as well as psychological concerns such as fear of recurrence. Cancer patients, caregivers, and survivors must have the infor- mation and support they need to play an active role in decisions that affect treatment and quality of life.

the stoma is closed and the ends of the large intestine recon- nected in a procedure called colostomy reversal. Rectal cancer patients require a colostomy more often than colon cancer patients (29% versus 12%, respectively).82 A permanent colos- tomy may be required if the anus and the sphincter muscle are removed during surgery.
We used an expert provided list of 42 relevant domain terms for the Myocardial Perfusion Imaging domain (a sub-domain of nuclear cardiology) to heuristically test the coverage of our ontology terms. Of these, we found 31 exactly matching terms, 2 morphological variants and 8 phrases that contained the terms from the expert list. Out of this 42 domain terms, 1 term, ‘dyperidamole’, was not found in our ontology (dyperidamole is a drug given during pregnancy). We found that this term didn’t exist in the 618 JNC abstracts we were using. Instead, another term, diperidamole (spelling variant) existed in our term list. To do away with noise in our data, we selected terms with greater than average frequency (2.9) of the 10191 retrieved terms and set that as our threshold. We pruned the list to

The numbers in each block are codes for the treatment given to each animal. The purpose of such a design is to reduce heterogeneity associated with time, space and some physical varia- tion. The five animals in Block 1 would be chosen to be as similar as possible with respect to age, weight, genotype and any other variable which might influence the outcome. They would then be assigned at random to one of the five treatments. The animals would be housed in close proximity, and possibly even in the same cage, if the different treatments can be given in such a situation. When measurements are to be made on the animals, those in Block 1 would be treated as a group, with all measurements being made within a short period by the same per- son. Animals in the other blocks would likewise be selected to be as uniform as possible, but might differ in body weight or age, etc. from those in Block 1. They could be measured at a dif- ferent time, if necessary by a different person. Thus, within each block any comparison among treatments would be made on animals which are in all possible ways as similar as possible. The unwanted variation shows up as differences between blocks. This is then removed mathe- matically in the statistical analysis.

The temperature change used for estimating thermal movements should be based on mean temperatures in the component. For solid masonry walls, tempera- tures at the center of the wall should be used. In cav- ity walls and veneers, the temperature at the center of each wythe or component should be used. In dis- continuous construction, the wythes will have different temperatures due to the separation of the wythes by an air space and perhaps insulation.

The IOM report supports these findings, stating that diagnostic errors contribute to 10% of patient deaths and 6-17% of hospital adverse events. Other researchers quantify the human cost of diagnostic errors at between 40,000 and 80,000 deaths per year.9 These troubling findings make developing effective methods to prevent diagnostic errors an urgent priority.

In the future, we would also like to increase the size of our con(cid:3)ated dataset and possibly create a biomedical all-words disambiguation test set to test our approach. Unlike SenseClusters, our approach can be used to perform all-words disambiguation. For example, given the sentence: His weight has fluctuated during the past month. We (cid:2)rst create a instance vector containing fluctuated, past and months for the word weight and a concept vector for each of its possible concepts, (cid:147)C0005912: Body Weight(cid:148) and (cid:147)C0699807: Quantitative Concept(cid:148) us- ing their context descriptions. We then calculate the cosine between the instance vector and each of the two concept vectors. The concept whose vector has the smallest cosine score is assigned to weight. We then repeat this process for fluctuated, past and months. We also plan to explore using different contex- tual information to improve the accuracy of our approach. We are currently exploring using co- occurrence and relational information about the pos- sible CUIs in the UMLS. Our IDF stoplist exper-

For newer targeted cancer medicines, there are two additional areas of uncertainty. Firstly, despite their established mechanisms of action, targeted cancer medicines may not have clinically-meaningful activities against all tumours with a matching genetic mutation. To this point, a clinical trial has found that the progression-free survival of patients with metastatic solid tumour refractory to standard of care did not improve with the use of targeted therapies that matched with the tumour’s molecular profile but outside their approved indications, compared to patients who received treatment at the choice of their treating physicians (79). This means that targeted therapies should only be used according to approved indications and not based on identified molecular alternations or the general type of cancer.

One can reasonably assert that this beneficial anxiolytic effect might have been enhanced even further under three study design conditions. First, if the inclusion criteria had required each patient to have a high anxiety score prior to the procedure, for instance a minimum of 7 points (with 10 as the maximum), there would have been a greater potential for a difference pre-treatment vs. during the procedure. The six responders had a baseline average of 6.3 points, so there was room for improvement. Of the six responders, two subjects had low baseline anxiety scores (i.e., patient F at 4 points and patient I at 2 points). A higher baseline inclusion parameter could have increased the differential prior to vs. during the EMG procedure. Second, there might not have been a sufficiently long waiting period between the drug administration and the procedure. One can reasonably assert that if the time interval between dosing and the procedure was increased to a minimum of 30 minutes or more (from the 10 – 20 minutes), the percentage of responders and the magnitude of the response could have been greater. However, it should be noted that often in a clinic time-is-of-the-essence between the patient’s initial assessment by the medical provider and the subsequent medical procedure. Some medical providers are willing to pre-treat an anxious patient, typically with an oral benzodiazepine either swallowed intact or pre-dissolved in water, and then have him/her wait (e.g., 30 + min.) for an anxiolytic effect to be acknowledged by the patient. But, some physicians and dentists might be under time constraints or might not be willing to oblige the patient this waiting period. This would not be an obstacle if either the drug has a rapid onset of effect or the patient were to pre-treat themselves immediately prior to arrival at the physician’s office, for instance 30-60 minutes in advance. Even under the conditions of this study that the authors consider might have been sub-optimal, this drug combo delivered by the oral mucosal route provided a rapid onset effect as a PRN medication. This anxiolytic benefit may be useful in treating anticipatory anxiety either in-office or prior to arrival. There is a third limitation to this study to consider. The compounded medicine contained 25 mg of atenolol and 0.2 mg of scopolamine HBr.

The structural design of cavity walls should follow either rational or empirical methods. The rational design method is based on the properties of the wall materials and engineering analysis. This method may be used for any structure where high loads are likely or where tall walls are a necessity. The empirical method is generally satisfactory for one and two-story buildings consisting of light construction with limited floor spans and wall heights; and for multistory buildings where unsupported wall heights are not excessive.

Although, it was assumed that the 'thicker' articles with wider range of vocabulary is preferable in the editors hands, the editors (and probably the readers) prefer simple, clear and coherent writing, rather than a fancy or complex, pseudo-scientific style. Also Funkhouser and Maccoby (1971) showed that the information gain is especially enhanced by the “use of examples", i.e. it helps a lot to use some non-science material, such as everyday life parallels, historical points, etc. On the other hand, some sections, such as Introduction and Discussion, have to intrigue readers and attract interest and should therefore not be over-simplified. For example, a mysterious title can catch readers' attention and will be easily remembered (e.g.: T.Y. Li and J. Yorke named their famous paper on chaos: "The period three means chaos"). Some sections require more skill and are more important. It is approximated that from all published journal RAs in the world, only less than 5% are read in detail. However, more than 50% of abstracts are read and so the quality of an abstracts is much more important (Gordon, 1983). Therefore, the abstract should present the 'story' of the RA in miniature and should be readable standalone.

Reassessments might be per- formed less frequently for patients with more stable pain (eg, patients who have exhibited good pain con- trol without side effects after 24 hours of stable ther- apy). Pain reassessments might be useful at the time of nursing shift changes or with new caregivers to establish a baseline and promote continuity of care, although evidence showing that routine reassessment of pain at nursing shift changes is associated with improved clinical outcomes is not available.

medicine (NMM) and OMM obtain many more hundreds of hours of manual medicine training in a wider variety of clinical settings than DCs and other DOs. This section was meant to give you a better sense of what “osteopathic manipulative medicine” entails, and hopefully it answered most of your questions regarding OMM. The effectiveness of OMM remains a topic of ongoing debate and research despite past and current efforts to lay these arguments to rest. Whether an osteo- pathic physician uses OMM in his or her practice is based entirely on preference. With that said, it is an important core discipline and primary distinction of the osteopathic profession.

prices of pharmaceuticals grew faster than the collective prices of all goods and services (Fig. 4.6a, p.61). However, the trends in the two countries began to diverge in the late 1980s where the price level of medicines continued to rise faster in the USA, while the growth rate of pharmaceutical prices in Australia seemed to have been stabilized at around 10% higher than the consumer price index. This could possibly be due to the introduction of “cost effectiveness” as a requirement before listing a medicine on the national pharmaceutical insurance scheme, so as to ensure the benefits of a given medicine were high enough to justify the price requested by the manufacturer (246). The divergence became more prominent when the Australian Government undertook further reforms of its national scheme after 2005 (247), which was implemented in response to a report that warned “in 40 years’ time, the PBS could account for 3.4% of GDP, making it the largest part of the Government’s spending on health” (248). The reforms seem to have resulted in gradual normalization of the growth rate of medicine prices in Australia to a level in line with the overall inflation rate of other consumer goods (Fig. 4.6a). In contrast, medicine prices continued to grow considerably in the USA, with the cumulative growth reaching 2.4 times the overall inflation rate of other consumer goods in 2017. Of note, the price level of prescription medicines in the USA rose in parallel with Pricing and reimbursement policies in Australia over four decades have controlled the growth rate of medicine prices.

The numbers in each block are codes for the treatment given to each animal. The purpose of such a design is to reduce heterogeneity associated with time, space and some physical varia- tion. The five animals in Block 1 would be chosen to be as similar as possible with respect to age, weight, genotype and any other variable which might influence the outcome. They would then be assigned at random to one of the five treatments. The animals would be housed in close proximity, and possibly even in the same cage, if the different treatments can be given in such a situation. When measurements are to be made on the animals, those in Block 1 would be treated as a group, with all measurements being made within a short period by the same per- son. Animals in the other blocks would likewise be selected to be as uniform as possible, but might differ in body weight or age, etc. from those in Block 1. They could be measured at a dif- ferent time, if necessary by a different person. Thus, within each block any comparison among treatments would be made on animals which are in all possible ways as similar as possible. The unwanted variation shows up as differences between blocks. This is then removed mathe- matically in the statistical analysis.

medically related text and metadata features, such as “pa- tients,” “alzheimer,” “health information management,” and “medicine” are also important and of mostly positive polar- ity, since medical articles attract greater news coverage than, say, a recently published computer science paper. As we dis- cuss later, the presence of “alzheimer” as an important, neg- ative feature is more an artifact of the dataset than an iden- tification of trends in popularity. We also find an artifact of year (2016) of the dataset with the feature “zika virus,” due to the 2015-2016 zika epidemic in North and South Amer- ica. Three publishers appear in the top 20, the Massachusetts Medical Society, the publisher of the New England Journal ofMedicine,oneofthemostprestigiouspeer-reviewedmed- ical journals, “The Royal Society,” publisher of the less pres- tigious, but longest-running scientific journal, “Philosophi- cal Transactions of the Royal Society,” and “Elsevier,” one of the largest science publishers.

The strength and moisture penetration resistance of a brick masonry cavity wall are affected by the mortar selection and compatibility with the brick units. Portland cement-lime, mortar cement, or masonry cement mortars can be used. However, mortars with an air content less than 12 percent are recommended for their superior bond strength and resistance to moisture penetration. The MSJC Code requires that the allowable flexural tensile stresses be reduced by approximately 50 percent for assemblies constructed with masonry cement mortars or portland cement-lime mortars that have air entrainment. In addition, some building codes prohibit the use of masonry cement mortars and all Type N mortars in Seismic Performance Categories D and E (formerly Seismic Zones 3 and 4). Mortar should meet the proportion requirements of ASTM C 270 Specification for Mortar for Unit Masonry as shown in Table 1. Mortar type selection should be based on project requirements, such as strength and compatibility with a particular brick unit. Types N or S mortars are typically used in brick masonry cavity walls. See Technical Notes 8 Series for more detailed information on mortar types and selection.
Your child has been identified as needing services for English Language Learners (ELL). Your child will be placed in the ESL/Bilingual Education dual language immersion program, as outlined in the attached document. We believe that this program will help meet your child’s educational needs and enhance his/her academic success in school. Your child will be assessed twice yearly, or as needed, to determine progress toward individual ELL goals. When your child scores in the acceptable range (4.5 Literacy/5.0 Overall) on all areas of the W-APT or ACCESS assessment they will be exited from the program. If your student currently has an Individualized Education Program (IEP), their needs will continue to be met through their current accommodations.

• Fatigue and sleepiness. Feelings of fatigue (low energy, physical tiredness, weariness) are more common than symptoms of sleepiness (actual tendency to fall asleep) in patients with chronic insomnia. The presence of significant sleepiness should prompt a search for other potential sleep disorders. The number, duration, and timing of naps should be thoroughly investigated, as both a consequence of in- somnia and a potential contributing factor.

Numerous alternative beta blockers are available in lieu of propranolol. Notable among these is the common drug, atenolol, that is available in oral solid dose forms ranging from 25 to 100 mg for the treatment of hypertension. Multiple doses per day may be permitted. It has been used to suppress stage fright in performers when administered orally in advance [45]. Atenolol is a beta-1 selective peripheral-acting agent without CNS effects, which should reduce the risk for asthmatic subjects [46]. Thus, atenolol might be preferred over the nonselective beta blockers for patients affected by asthma or COPD [47]. Oral atenolol at 50 - 200 mg doses suppressed heart rate by ~ 23 - 24 beats per minute (bpm) vs. ~ 10 bpm on placebo [46]. Also,

O ceratocone, a degeneração marginal pelúcida e ectasia pós-cirurgia refrativa são doenças que causam afilamento e abaulamento da córnea (estrutura transparente que forma a parede anterior do globo ocular). Estas alterações provocam astigmatismo irregular com distorção visual importante. O grau de embaçamento visual vai depender do grau de astigmatismo produzido e da existência de outras alterações oculares associadas. Astigmatismo pós-transplante de córnea é um grau residual que ocorre dependendo da intera- ção entre córnea doada e receptor (coaptação, cicatrização, abertura e frouxidão de pontos no decorrer da cicatrização e sua retirada).

Phase 1. The aim of Phase 1 was to identify the contributions of clinical and laboratory variables that in practice were the most predictive of the decision to initiate DMARD therapy in a population of patients with early undifferentiated synovitis. Initiation of DMARD therapy was used as an indicator of the physician’s opinion that the patient was at risk of developing persistent and/or erosive arthritis that we would currently consider to be RA. Data on 3,115 patients from 9 early arthritis cohorts who were consid- ered not to have evidence of another possible diagnosis explaining their presentation were obtained. Between July 2007 and November 2008 an expert working group developed an analysis strategy that related an agreed- upon list of standardized clinical and laboratory vari- ables collected at baseline to the initiation of DMARD treatment within the next 12 months. MTX initiation was used as the gold standard for this purpose. The analytical process aimed to identify the independent contribution of each variable on this list and included univariate regression modeling, a subsequent principal components analysis, and a multivariate regression model that included all identified components (25). The resulting list of informative variables identified during that process and the weights based on the odds ratios are shown in Table 1. Phase 2. Phase 2 consisted of a consensus-based, decision science–informed approach, which took place between November 2008 and June 2009. The purpose of this phase was to derive a clinician-based judgment on

industry for anti-infectives overall, and significantly better than for other therapeutic areas, such as neurol- ogy and oncology. One difficulty with such an analysis is that new chemotypes have an inherently higher risk than additional members of established chemical classes, other than the risks of failure due to resistance (which are higher for drugs that have been used for many years). For this review’s new analysis (Table 8), new chemotypes are separated from life-cycle management projects. The overall success rates have not changed significantly in the last 3 years, either for MMV or for the CMR benchmark, which is reassuring. The data shows that a new molecule in formal preclinical evaluation has an 8% chance of becoming part of a product.

The use of two antimalarials simultaneously, especially when the antimalarials have different mechanisms of action, has the potential for inhib- iting the development of resistance to either of the components. The efficacy of a combination of a 4-aminoquinoline drug (either chloroquine or amo- diaquine) with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine has been reviewed (43). The results of this review sug- gested that the addition of either chloroquine or amodiaquine to SP marginally improved parasitological clearance (compared with SP alone). The studies reviewed were mostly done in areas and at times when both SP and chloroquine/amodi- aquine retained a fair amount of efficacy, and it is not clear from these studies how well such a combination would act in areas where one of the components was significantly compromised. Additionally, to date, there are no data to suggest whether this slightly improved clearance would

When analyzing the data, we found that there does not exist a CUI de(cid:2)nition for a large number of pos- sible concepts. Table 5 shows the number of words in the CUI and ST de(cid:2)nitions for each concept in the NLM-WSD dataset. Only four target words have a CUI de(cid:2)nition for each possible concept. We also found the concept de(cid:2)nitions vary widely in length. The CUI de(cid:2)nitions in the UMLS come from a va- riety of sources and there may exist more than one de(cid:2)nition per source. Unlike CUI de(cid:2)nitions, there does exist an ST de(cid:2)nition for each possible con- cept. The ST de(cid:2)nitions come from the same source and are approximately the same length but they are a broad categorization. We believe this makes them too coarse grained to provide descriptive enough in- formation about their associated concepts.

Recent analyses of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)- Medicare database tracked healthcare use and costs (projected to 2004 levels) from diagnosis and initial treatment [ 15 ] , in addition to a 4-year follow-up [ 17 ] , for a cohort of 81 659 elderly patients with prostate cancer who had Medicare claims from 1991 to 2003 [ 15 ] , and 1991 to 2004 [ 17 ] , respectively. Treatment in the fi rst year after diagnosis was calculated to incur costs of $21 040 per patient; $13 091 for prostate cancer-related costs and $7949 for medical costs unrelated to prostate cancer [ 15 ] . In terms of cost at each stage, as expected, there was an increase in costs from stage I to IV [ 15,17 ] . Prostate cancer-related costs over 4 years from diagnosis averaged $18 168 per patient [ 17 ] . The annual healthcare cost burden estimated in 2009 is &gt; $2.5 billion annually for initial care alone [ 17 ] .

As reflected in the statutory new drug and new animal drug approval standards in sections 505 109 and 512 of the FD&amp;C Act and the standard for licensure under section 351 of the PHS Act, the 110 evidence that is the basis for the risk assessment of a drug differs from the evidence that is the 111 basis for an effectiveness determination. The effectiveness determination is generally intended 112 to evaluate a drug’s positive effect based on adequate and well-controlled trials designed to 113 evaluate a specific efficacy variable (or a discrete number of efficacy variables) for the purpose 114 of distinguishing the effect of the drug from other influences.11 In contrast, FDA’s premarket 115 risk assessment is intended to identify and characterize the nature, frequency, and severity of the 116 usually broad spectrum of adverse events and other risks associated with the use of a product 117 based on a range of data sources. For human drugs, the supporting data are generally not derived 118 from studies designed to test a specific safety hypothesis. The assessment is based largely on 119 observations of adverse events from studies intended to assess effectiveness and includes all 120 patients exposed to the investigational drug during its development. For animal drugs, there are 121 generally data from safety studies in the target animal, in addition to observations of adverse 122 events from studies intended to assess effectiveness.12 For both human and animal drugs, 123 relevant data are weighted and integrated, based on the nature and reliability of the data sources, 124 into a coherent assessment of what adverse reactions are reasonably associated with the use of a 125 product and, to the extent possible, their frequency and severity.13 126

A cancer is cured when all traces of the cancer have been removed from the patient’s body. Although it is usually not possible to know if the cancer is completely eradicated, for many patients, the initial course of therapy is successful and the cancer never returns. However, some cancer- free survivors must cope with the long-term effects of treatment, as well as psychological concerns such as fear of recurrence. Cancer patients, caregivers, and survivors must have the infor- mation and support they need to play an active role in decisions that affect treatment and quality of life.
Having your child in quarantine does not require any restrictions with other household members unless your child is experiencing COVID-19 symptoms or has tested positive for COVID-19. If your child develops symptoms or tests positive, household members should also quarantine and await further instruction from public health.

a physician intentionally stimulates a physiologic response by CO 2 inhalation [31], sodium lactate infusion [32,33], or cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4) injection [32,34]. These chemical exposures are used as potent tools to design controlled studies with predictable levels of PA episodes. In a study with healthy volunteer subjects using carbon dioxide inhalation to provoke panic and anxiety, propranolol significantly decreased heart rate, a cardiovascular somatic symptom, but did not provide psychic anxiolytic benefit [35].
The statewide assessments in mathematics, reading, and science are used to measure whether students, and their school and district, are meeting the academic standards. Statewide assessments are one measure of how well students are doing on the content that is part of their daily instruction. It is also a measure of how well schools and districts are doing in aligning their curriculum and teaching the standards.

We used an expert provided list of 42 relevant domain terms for the Myocardial Perfusion Imaging domain (a sub-domain of nuclear cardiology) to heuristically test the coverage of our ontology terms. Of these, we found 31 exactly matching terms, 2 morphological variants and 8 phrases that contained the terms from the expert list. Out of this 42 domain terms, 1 term, ‘dyperidamole’, was not found in our ontology (dyperidamole is a drug given during pregnancy). We found that this term didn’t exist in the 618 JNC abstracts we were using. Instead, another term, diperidamole (spelling variant) existed in our term list. To do away with noise in our data, we selected terms with greater than average frequency (2.9) of the 10191 retrieved terms and set that as our threshold. We pruned the list to

of the weakest links in the system. A study in Malawi revealed that the condition of many seriously ill children arriving at clinicshadnotpreviouslybeenrecognized.Insteadofreceiving immediate emergency care they were kept waiting for long periods before being given proper treatment. This resulted in avoidable deaths and disability (28). In Mexico, verbal autopsies of 132 children who died revealed that the majority had been seen by a physician within three days of death. Poor selection of medications and late referral to tertiary care were judged to be important contributory factors in more than half the deaths (29). A qualitative study of 21 hospitals in seven developing countries found that poor triage of incoming patients and inadequate provision of emergency care jeopar- dized the lives of arriving patients (30). Fourteen of the facilities (including 10 of 13 district hospitals) did not have an adequate triage system. A comprehensive review of the management of 131 children treated at these facilities found evidenceofinappropriateordelayedtriagein8%ofcases,poor clinical assessments in 41%, and potentially harmful delays in treatment in 19%. Several international health projects aimed at improving initial triage and treatment have been instituted at district health care facilities. Most focus on the strengthening of maternal and child health. One such project produced guidelines for emergency triage and treatment (28). An evaluation of these guidelines demonstrated that they significantly decreased the time required to assess children in need of urgent medical attention (31). In Sierra Leone a health care facility was upgraded in order to enhance its ability to provide prompt medical and surgicaltreatmenttowomenwithcomplicationsofpregnancy. The annual number of obstetric procedures rose from 2 to 38 over a period of five years. During the same period the

somnolence as a side effect is reproducible in susceptible individuals (White and Rumbold 1988). Sedation is a com- mon side effect of the traditional antipsychotics, with chlorpromazine and thioridazine somewhat more sedating than haloperidol. Clinical studies have shown a high inci- dence of persistent sedation with clozapine (46%) with less frequent reports of sedation with risperidone, olanzapine, sertindole and quetiapine (Monti et al. 2016). The sed- ation associated with these agents is most likely associated with their known effects on histaminic receptors. Doxepin, a sedating psychotropic agent with pro- nounced histamine (H-1) receptor antagonism exerts at least part of its effects by antagonizing orexin (Krystal et al. 2013). Suvorexant, is an orexin antagonist designed to lower waking arousal (Norman and Anderson 2016). Currently, it is being heavily marketed as a hypnotic (Rhyne and Anderson 2015). As based on performance and driving tests, this agent is known to produce a dose-related next day increase in somnolence for all age groupings tested (Farkus 2013). Sedative drug effects on daytime sleepiness are summarized in Table 4.

When analyzing the data, we found that there does not exist a CUI de(cid:2)nition for a large number of pos- sible concepts. Table 5 shows the number of words in the CUI and ST de(cid:2)nitions for each concept in the NLM-WSD dataset. Only four target words have a CUI de(cid:2)nition for each possible concept. We also found the concept de(cid:2)nitions vary widely in length. The CUI de(cid:2)nitions in the UMLS come from a va- riety of sources and there may exist more than one de(cid:2)nition per source. Unlike CUI de(cid:2)nitions, there does exist an ST de(cid:2)nition for each possible con- cept. The ST de(cid:2)nitions come from the same source and are approximately the same length but they are a broad categorization. We believe this makes them too coarse grained to provide descriptive enough in- formation about their associated concepts.

AASM practice parameter papers are based on evidence- based review and grading of literature, often addressing a spe- cific issue or topic. Clinical guidelines provide clinicians with a working overview for disease or disorder evaluation and man- agement. These guidelines include practice parameter papers and also include areas with limited evidence in order to provide a comprehensive practice guideline. Both practice parameters and clinical guidelines define principles of practice that should meet the needs of most patients. They should not, however, be considered exhaustive, inclusive of all available methods of care, or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably expected to obtain the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding appropriateness of any specific therapy must be made by the clinician and patient in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible

The FDA recently recommended that a warning be issued regarding adverse effects associated with BzRA hypnotics. These medications have been associated with reports of disruptive sleep related behaviors including sleepwalking, eating, driving, and sexual behavior. Patients should be cautioned about the potential for these adverse effects, and about the importance of allowing appropriate sleep time, using only prescribed doses and avoiding the combination of BzRA hypnotics with alcohol, other sedatives, and sleep restriction.

□ New Authorization: I hereby authorize the Virginia Housing Development Authority (VHDA) to deposit into my account any and all housing assistance payments payable by VHDA to me under the Housing Choice Voucher Program and to correct entries for such deposits hereafter made in such account. This authority will remain in force until I have submitted a written revocation to VHDA, which revocation shall be in such form and shall be submitted prior to such date as VHDA shall require. I understand that VHDA reserves the right to make such payments to me by check rather than by direct deposit.
Dose ranging test: Here, compounds are tested at a minimum of 4 different doses (the “dose ranging, full 4-day test”, typically 100, 30, 10 and 3 mg/kg, by both s.c. and p.o. routes of administration). ED 50 and ED 90 values are calculated by plotting the log dose against probit activity (for example, using Microcal “Origin”). These reflect the drug concentrations at which 50% and 90% of suppression of parasitemia is achieved. Note that with short half-life drugs it may be necessary to dose multiple times per day. Two other parameters measured in this study are relative potency compared to an appropriate standard drug, and oral bioavailability (assessed by comparison of oral and parenteral administration).

1. Describing – by clearly defining what you are talking about, what specifically was involved, where it took place and under what circumstances. 2. Reflecting – reconsidering a topic by taking into account new information or a new experience, or considering other viewpoints. 3. Analyzing – examining and then explaining how something is, including comparing and contrasting different elements and understanding relationships to your subject/topic. 4. Critiquing – identifying and examining weaknesses in arguments, as well as acknowledging its strengths. It’s important to think of critiquing as ‘neutral’ and not negative. 5. Reasoning – using methods such as cause and effect to demonstrate logical thinking, as well as presenting evidence that either refutes or proves an argument.
istic option. Clinical diagnosis offers the advantages of ease, speed, and low cost. In areas where malaria is prevalent, clinical diagnosis usually results in all patients with fever and no apparent other cause being treated for malaria. This approach can iden- tify most patients who truly need antimalarial treat- ment, but it is also likely to misclassify many who do not (15). Over-diagnosis can be considerable and contributes to misuse of antimalarial drugs. Considerable overlap exists between the signs and
The goals of treatment are to “cure” the cancer, if possible; pro- long survival; and provide the highest possible quality of life during and after treatment. A cancer is cured when all traces of the cancer have been removed from the patient’s body. Although it is usually not possible to know if the cancer is completely eradicated, for many patients, the initial course of therapy is successful and the cancer never returns. However, some cancer- free survivors must cope with the long-term effects of treatment, as well as psychological concerns such as fear of recurrence. Cancer patients, caregivers, and survivors must have the infor- mation and support they need to play an active role in decisions that affect treatment and quality of life.
Profit control is an effective measure to manage medicine prices insofar as the regulators have control over the supply of medicines at certain points along the supply chain. Typically, this means that the regulator needs to have full visibility of the supply and distribution chains. The regulator also needs to have the capacity and ability to enforce non-compliance. Profit control is most effective when there is a publicly- funded universal programme for the provision of medicines. In contrast, it may be much less effective in health care settings where the private sector plays a significant role in the delivery of medicines, or where the structure of supply chain is complex or under-developed (183).

a) The regulation gives data subjects the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, where there is a legal or similarly significant effect on the person (the regulation prohibits automated processing where there is no meaningful human involvement in the decision and where the decision either impacts one’s legal rights, or the decision has the potential to significantly influence the circumstances, behavior, or choices of the individuals concerned). b) Other considerations: i) Research affecting the healthcare a person receives, where there is no human involvement in the decision, would be considered covered under the regulation (i.e., assigning trial subjects to receive an intervention or placebo, based solely on the individual’s personal data, i.e., test results)
Return-to-sport progressions should be individualised based on the injury, athlete’s age, history and level of play, and the ability to provide close supervision during the return to activity, and progressions may vary between athletes. Each stage is generally 24 hours without return of concussion symptoms. Consider written clearance from a healthcare professional before return to sport as directed by local laws and regulations.3

The increase in full-text downloads for open access articles during their first year after publication suggests that the primary benefit to the nonsubscriber commu- nity is in browsing, as opposed to printing or saving, which would have been indicated by a commensurate increase in PDF downloads. The decrease in abstract views suggests a reader preference for the full docu- ment when available.

The TSST method has been used to study the effects of oral propranolol in volunteer subjects [25-28]. The assessments of psychic anxiety can be assessed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) or other similar tools [29,30]. The somatic and psychic effects of oral propranolol were tested using the TSST method in healthy adult volunteers. Propranolol (40 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, reduced systolic blood pressure, and enhanced cognitive flexibility during stress. In another study propranolol (80 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, but paradoxically increased salivary cortisol, and did not significantly affect BP or subjective stress [25]. But, in another TSST study daily oral propranolol (80 mg) did not affect the salivary cortisol response [27].

receptor antagonist that affects the autonomic nervous system and reduces cardiovascular symptoms (e.g., tachycardia and hypertension) resulting from epinephrine in the circulation. Beta blockers interfere with receptor binding by catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine, of which epinephrine is the principal catecholamine affecting the cardiovascular symptoms. Propranolol is a lipophilic beta blocker that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, it can affect both somatic and CNS target tissues.

What is the purpose of a RA and what makes it a good one, and who decides that it is a good RA? Are there rules for easier writing? If the main function of a RA is to transfer a new knowledge on a research topic, then a good paper is the one that is clear, coherent, focused, well argued and uses language that does not have ambiguous or equivoque meaning. However, it is not only the message that is important. The RA must have a well-defined structure and function in serve like a cook-book, so the others can reproduce and repeat explained experiments. Answer research questions Give summary conclusions There are some rules that can make the writing and publishing of RAs 'easier'. Here, we summarised some 'golden' rules that should always be in the mind of an inexperienced researcher (Table 3). We put all these together to make a final list of some 40 logical steps, which can be find in the Appendix.

6. Identify the efflorescence. Knowing the composition of efflorescing salts is sometimes of use. Table 1, taken from Brownell’s report lists the most probable sources of efflorescing salts. Commercial testing laboratories can use X-ray diffraction, petrographic analysis or chemical analysis can, in some instances, determine both the type of salts present and their relative quantity. 7. Consider miscellaneous sources of water when all obvious sources have been eliminated. Some of these sources are: condensation within the wall, poorly directed landscape sprinklers, leaky pipes, faulty drains and condensation on heating or plumbing pipes. If necessary, condensation analysis methods are described in Technical Note 47.

Insomnia occurs in individuals of all ages and races, and has been observed across all cultures and countries.8,9 The actual prevalence of insomnia varies according to the stringency of the definition used. Insomnia symptoms occur in approximately 33% to 50% of the adult population; insomnia symptoms with dis- tress or impairment (i.e., general insomnia disorder) in 10% to 15%; and specific insomnia disorders in 5% to 10%.10 Consis- tent risk factors for insomnia include increasing age, female sex, comorbid (medical, psychiatric, sleep, and substance use) disor- ders, shift work, and possibly unemployment and lower socio- economic status. Patients with comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions are at particularly increased risk, with psychiatric and chronic pain disorders having insomnia rates as high as 50% to 75%.11-13 The risk relationship between insomnia and psychiatric disorders appears to be bidirectional; several studies have also

It includes information on stain composition, factors that influence their occurrence, and stain prevention. Key Words: carbonates, chlorides, efflorescence, manganese, rain water, silicates, stains, soluble salts, sulfates, vanadium.
There are many, often complicated, mechanisms of efflorescence. Simply stated, efflorescence occurs when water containing dissolved salts is brought to the surface of masonry, the water evaporates and the salts are left on the surface of the masonry. The salt solutions may migrate across surfaces of masonry units, between the mortar and units, or through the pores of the mortar or units.

There are debates about whether the returns generated from the sales of medicines, including cancer medicines, are sufficient for pharmaceutical companies to cover their past R&amp;D expenses, maintain their operations and engage in future drug discovery research. For example, some commentators have observed that the revenue generated from the sales of imatinib had exceeded the costs of R&amp;D within two years and “the revenues over the subsequent years of the patent would represent generous profits to the company” (30). Another study found that total revenue from the sales of 10 cancer medicines since approval over a median of four years (US$ 67.0 billion) was 9.3 times the total R&amp;D spending of US$ 7.2 billion (or 7.4 times using an estimated risk-adjusted R&amp;D costs of US$ 9.1 billion) (94).
• Fatigue and sleepiness. Feelings of fatigue (low energy, physical tiredness, weariness) are more common than symptoms of sleepiness (actual tendency to fall asleep) in patients with chronic insomnia. The presence of significant sleepiness should prompt a search for other potential sleep disorders. The number, duration, and timing of naps should be thoroughly investigated, as both a consequence of in- somnia and a potential contributing factor.

For the (2 vs. 2) SVM schema, one can observe from Table 6 that the highest overall accuracy is 0.91 and generated by a feature combination of POS-based unigrams and K-array semantics-based sequential features, regardless of whether WordNet is used to correct the POS of a unigram or not. In terms of the kernel functions, a linear kernel is used at the first level of the SVM model and a polynomial kernel at the second level. In addition, we notice that the inclusion of bigrams (the last four rows in Table 6) does not improve accuracy but rather reduce the accuracy. This agrees with results reported in previous studies. Tables 7 and 8 present the confusion matrices resulted from the two best feature sets using the (2 vs. 2) SVM schema. These two tables elaborate the two optimal feature sets as highlighted in Table 6. Results are obtained by using a linear and a polynomial kernel at the two levels respectively and averaged over 10-fold cross validation. Notice that in certain cases, the model cannot ditinguish between positive and neutral polarities due to the reasons discussed above; while negative and no-relationship can often be correctly identified.

As reflected in the statutory new drug and new animal drug approval standards in sections 505 109 and 512 of the FD&amp;C Act and the standard for licensure under section 351 of the PHS Act, the 110 evidence that is the basis for the risk assessment of a drug differs from the evidence that is the 111 basis for an effectiveness determination. The effectiveness determination is generally intended 112 to evaluate a drug’s positive effect based on adequate and well-controlled trials designed to 113 evaluate a specific efficacy variable (or a discrete number of efficacy variables) for the purpose 114 of distinguishing the effect of the drug from other influences.11 In contrast, FDA’s premarket 115 risk assessment is intended to identify and characterize the nature, frequency, and severity of the 116 usually broad spectrum of adverse events and other risks associated with the use of a product 117 based on a range of data sources. For human drugs, the supporting data are generally not derived 118 from studies designed to test a specific safety hypothesis. The assessment is based largely on 119 observations of adverse events from studies intended to assess effectiveness and includes all 120 patients exposed to the investigational drug during its development. For animal drugs, there are 121 generally data from safety studies in the target animal, in addition to observations of adverse 122 events from studies intended to assess effectiveness.12 For both human and animal drugs, 123 relevant data are weighted and integrated, based on the nature and reliability of the data sources, 124 into a coherent assessment of what adverse reactions are reasonably associated with the use of a 125 product and, to the extent possible, their frequency and severity.13 126

7.    Shortage   of Leucovorin     (J0640)
In the late 1800s, Andrew Taylor Still identified the neuromusculoskeletal system as the key element in health maintenance and stressed preventive aspects of medi- cine in place of drug therapy. During that time, osteop- athy was truly separate and distinct from the world of allo- pathic medicine. Since then, as medicine in general has become more evidence-based and supported by research, osteopathic philosophy has evolved into a more complete and robust osteopathic medicine. The phrase “osteopathic medicine” is now the accepted term for the profession over “osteopathy,” a now-antiquated term that represents a period when Still championed a near-drugless form of manual medicine. Since its conception, osteopathic med- icine has adapted its body of knowledge to incorporate contemporary scientific thought, including germ theory, pharmacology, and other “allopathic” teachings. The cen- tral tenets of osteopathic thought, however, have been maintained and continue to guide DOs in their practice of medicine. Though interprofessional relations between MDs and DOs are better than they have ever been before, challenges still exist in terms of keeping the osteopathic tradition intact, improving the evidence basis of OMM via clinical research, and advocating for widespread recogni- tion of DOs.

Based on the size of the flue selected, a preliminary damper size must be assumed. At this point in the design process, it is only necessary to decide if the damper throat area to be used will be equal to or twice the flue area. Once this decision has been made the Inlet Loss Coefficient, K 2, may be determined. If the damper throat area is equal to the flue area, K 2 is equal to 2.5. If the damper throat is twice the flue area, K 2 is equal to 1.0.

Abstract: This Technical Note describes the mechanisms leading to the formation of efflorescence, including probable sources of soluble salts and moisture. Conditions necessary to cause efflorescence to appear are presented, along with design recommendations and practices that reduce the potential for efflorescence.
The analysis found that low-income countries could spend on average up to US$ 3800 per cancer patient annually on cancer medicines for all newly-diagnosed cancer patients, and the total expenditure on these medicines would be within the generously assumed 5% of the total health expenditure (Table 4.2). In high- income countries, the analysis found that a budget threshold of 5% of the total health expenditure would allow a spending of up to US$ 40 600 on cancer medicines per patient per year, with a view to providing universal coverage.

Sleep-inducing drugs (hypnotics) are medications specif- ically designed to induce sleepiness directly after intake. Optimal agents affect cognitive performance during this period while inducing minimal sleepiness in the waking day after use. An optimal hypnotic would have low tox- icity and addictive potential, as well a minimal side effect profile (Oswald 1970). Among the first hypnotics, and an agent still in use is chloral hydrate - the original “Mickey Finn” - slipped into the drinks of unsuspecting marks for the purposes of criminal activity. Unfortu- nately, this medication is difficult to use since the LD-50 (potentially fatal dose) is quite close to the therapeutic dose. In the years leading up to the 1970’s, rapidly acting barbiturates were commonly utilized for their hypnotic effects. Unfortunately, these medications, also drugs of abuse, had a significant danger of overdose and contrib- uted to an era that was characterized in part by deaths due to overdoses of sleeping pills. These medications and similar barbiturate-like medications [Methaqualone (Quaalude, Sopor) Glutethimide (Doriden), Ethchlor- vynol (Placidyl), Methyprylon (Nodudar)] have limited availability and are rarely used due to limited efficacy, cognitive effects, the potential for abuse and lethal tox- icity associated with overdose (Oswald 1970). Today their primary therapeutic uses include executions and fa- cilitated euthanasia (Lossignol 2008). Most currently utilized hypnotics affect the widely dis- persed negative neurotransmitter GABA. In the 1970’s benzodiazepines (GABA agonists) were first marketed as hypnotics. Some of these agents had an extremely short duration of action [Triazolam (Halcion)]. While this agent-induced minimal next day somnolence, use was as- sociated with daytime memory impairment, particularly at higher dosages (Roehrs et al. 2000; Adam and Oswald

These assignment guidelines pertain exclusively to Commercial Mobile Radio Service providers (CMRS). The IMSI Administrator directly administers only the Home Network Identity (HNI) segment of the resource. The HNI uniquely identifies the home wireless network of a FCC- licensed two-way CMRS subscriber and contains the Mobile Country Code (MCC) and the Mobile Network Code (MNC). The remaining segment of the IMSI, the Mobile Station Identification Number (MSIN), is directly administered by the wireless network licensee to which the HNI is assigned. Issue: In 1998, ITU Recommendation E.212 was modified allowing IMSI assignments to those Wireline Service Providers offering limited mobility services. As a result, HNI assignments are no longer available exclusively to CMRS providers. The current IMSI assignment and administrative guidelines do not however reflect these modifications.

A patient’s decision to use an OON provider selection may be intentional or accidental. Reasons patients may incur OON costs include patient preference for a particular provider or specialty care center that may be out of network, the lack of network providers with appropriate specialists, and the lack of awareness or transparency about which providers are in the patient’s plan network. Common scenarios for accidental use of OON providers are emergency care or care from an OON provider working at an in-network hospital (e.g., radiologist, assistant surgeon, anesthesiologist).22 23 Figure 9 suggests that there might be significant financial consequences to the patient going out of network, which could be exacerbated if health plans remove popular cancer providers from their networks. Figure 9 also provides information on the relationship between the OON percentage (right vertical axis--relative to total spending) and total patient cost-sharing (left vertical axis). While most patients in our study reported under 10% of all OOP cost in the year of diagnosis is spent on out-of- network providers, those in the highest percentile of OOP spending incurred as much as 40% of those costs out-of-network.

istic option. Clinical diagnosis offers the advantages of ease, speed, and low cost. In areas where malaria is prevalent, clinical diagnosis usually results in all patients with fever and no apparent other cause being treated for malaria. This approach can iden- tify most patients who truly need antimalarial treat- ment, but it is also likely to misclassify many who do not (15). Over-diagnosis can be considerable and contributes to misuse of antimalarial drugs. Considerable overlap exists between the signs and

Studies of international regulations of drug prices and the Gant Consortium’s own analysis of the Canadian, English, and German experiences suggest that there are several “necessary but not sufficient” components of value-based drug regulations. One study of MEAs argues that key components of successful agreements include:

The use of two antimalarials simultaneously, especially when the antimalarials have different mechanisms of action, has the potential for inhib- iting the development of resistance to either of the components. The efficacy of a combination of a 4-aminoquinoline drug (either chloroquine or amo- diaquine) with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine has been reviewed (43). The results of this review sug- gested that the addition of either chloroquine or amodiaquine to SP marginally improved parasitological clearance (compared with SP alone). The studies reviewed were mostly done in areas and at times when both SP and chloroquine/amodi- aquine retained a fair amount of efficacy, and it is not clear from these studies how well such a combination would act in areas where one of the components was significantly compromised. Additionally, to date, there are no data to suggest whether this slightly improved clearance would

prices of pharmaceuticals grew faster than the collective prices of all goods and services (Fig. 4.6a, p.61). However, the trends in the two countries began to diverge in the late 1980s where the price level of medicines continued to rise faster in the USA, while the growth rate of pharmaceutical prices in Australia seemed to have been stabilized at around 10% higher than the consumer price index. This could possibly be due to the introduction of “cost effectiveness” as a requirement before listing a medicine on the national pharmaceutical insurance scheme, so as to ensure the benefits of a given medicine were high enough to justify the price requested by the manufacturer (246). The divergence became more prominent when the Australian Government undertook further reforms of its national scheme after 2005 (247), which was implemented in response to a report that warned “in 40 years’ time, the PBS could account for 3.4% of GDP, making it the largest part of the Government’s spending on health” (248). The reforms seem to have resulted in gradual normalization of the growth rate of medicine prices in Australia to a level in line with the overall inflation rate of other consumer goods (Fig. 4.6a). In contrast, medicine prices continued to grow considerably in the USA, with the cumulative growth reaching 2.4 times the overall inflation rate of other consumer goods in 2017. Of note, the price level of prescription medicines in the USA rose in parallel with Pricing and reimbursement policies in Australia over four decades have controlled the growth rate of medicine prices.

Readership analysis was conducted on the 20 science journals in our data set (n(cid:1)2903). Articles published in the social sciences and humanities journals (n(cid:1)350) were omitted from the readership analysis, as many did not include abstract or full-text versions of their articles, and, in some cases, refer- ence views were added to full-text views, resulting in indeter- minate and incomparable results. Citation analyses were conducted on the entire article data set (n(cid:1)3245). A logistic regression model was used to estimate the likelihood of articles in each experimental group being cited within the first year after publication, controlling for journal and journal category effects.

Wind turbines will be used to harness the kinetic energy of the moving air over the oceans on the OCS and convert it to electricity. Offshore winds are less turbulent (because the ocean is flat relative to onshore topography), and they tend to flow at higher speeds than onshore winds, thus allowing turbines to produce more electricity. Because the potential energy produced from the wind is directly proportional to the cube of the wind speed, increased wind speeds of only a few miles per hour can produce a significantly larger amount of electricity. For instance, a turbine at a site with an average wind speed of 16 mph would produce 50% more electricity than at a site with the same turbine and average wind speeds of 14 mph (Offshore Wind 2006).

These assignment guidelines pertain exclusively to Commercial Mobile Radio Service providers (CMRS). The IMSI Administrator directly administers only the Home Network Identity (HNI) segment of the resource. The HNI uniquely identifies the home wireless network of a FCC- licensed two-way CMRS subscriber and contains the Mobile Country Code (MCC) and the Mobile Network Code (MNC). The remaining segment of the IMSI, the Mobile Station Identification Number (MSIN), is directly administered by the wireless network licensee to which the HNI is assigned. Issue: In 1998, ITU Recommendation E.212 was modified allowing IMSI assignments to those Wireline Service Providers offering limited mobility services. As a result, HNI assignments are no longer available exclusively to CMRS providers. The current IMSI assignment and administrative guidelines do not however reflect these modifications.

Pain reassessments might be useful at the time of nursing shift changes or with new caregivers to establish a baseline and promote continuity of care, although evidence showing that routine reassessment of pain at nursing shift changes is associated with improved clinical outcomes is not available.

The structural design of cavity walls should follow either rational or empirical methods. The rational design method is based on the properties of the wall materials and engineering analysis. This method may be used for any structure where high loads are likely or where tall walls are a necessity. The empirical method is generally satisfactory for one and two-story buildings consisting of light construction with limited floor spans and wall heights; and for multistory buildings where unsupported wall heights are not excessive.

The numbers in each block are codes for the treatment given to each animal. The purpose of such a design is to reduce heterogeneity associated with time, space and some physical varia- tion. The five animals in Block 1 would be chosen to be as similar as possible with respect to age, weight, genotype and any other variable which might influence the outcome. They would then be assigned at random to one of the five treatments. The animals would be housed in close proximity, and possibly even in the same cage, if the different treatments can be given in such a situation. When measurements are to be made on the animals, those in Block 1 would be treated as a group, with all measurements being made within a short period by the same per- son. Animals in the other blocks would likewise be selected to be as uniform as possible, but might differ in body weight or age, etc. from those in Block 1. They could be measured at a dif- ferent time, if necessary by a different person. Thus, within each block any comparison among treatments would be made on animals which are in all possible ways as similar as possible. The unwanted variation shows up as differences between blocks. This is then removed mathe- matically in the statistical analysis.

Based on the size of the flue selected, a preliminary damper size must be assumed. At this point in the design process, it is only necessary to decide if the damper throat area to be used will be equal to or twice the flue area. Once this decision has been made the Inlet Loss Coefficient, K 2, may be determined. If the damper throat area is equal to the flue area, K 2 is equal to 2.5.

industry for anti-infectives overall, and significantly better than for other therapeutic areas, such as neurol- ogy and oncology. One difficulty with such an analysis is that new chemotypes have an inherently higher risk than additional members of established chemical classes, other than the risks of failure due to resistance (which are higher for drugs that have been used for many years). For this review’s new analysis (Table 8), new chemotypes are separated from life-cycle management projects. The overall success rates have not changed significantly in the last 3 years, either for MMV or for the CMR benchmark, which is reassuring. The data shows that a new molecule in formal preclinical evaluation has an 8% chance of becoming part of a product.

The goals of treatment are to “cure” the cancer, if possible; pro- long survival; and provide the highest possible quality of life during and after treatment. A cancer is cured when all traces of the cancer have been removed from the patient’s body. Although it is usually not possible to know if the cancer is completely eradicated, for many patients, the initial course of therapy is successful and the cancer never returns. However, some cancer- free survivors must cope with the long-term effects of treatment, as well as psychological concerns such as fear of recurrence. Cancer patients, caregivers, and survivors must have the infor- mation and support they need to play an active role in decisions that affect treatment and quality of life.

(cid:2) The panel recommends that clinicians offer multi- modal analgesia, or the use of a variety of analgesic medications and techniques combined with non- pharmacological interventions, for the treatment of postoperative pain in children and adults (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Multimodal analgesia, defined as the use of a variety of analgesic medication and techniques that target different mechanisms of action in the peripheral and/or central nervous system (which might also be combined with nonpharmacological interventions) might have ad- ditiveorsynergisticeffectsandmoreeffectivepainrelief compared with single-modality interventions. For example, clinicians might offer local anesthetic-based regional (peripheral and neuraxial) analgesic techniques in combination with systemic opioids and other analge- sics as part of a multimodal approach to perioperative pain. Because of the availability of effective nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies for postop- erative pain management, the panel suggests that clini- cians routinely incorporate around the clock nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies into multi- modal analgesia regimens. Systemic opioids might not be required in all patients. One study suggests that it shouldbeavoidedwhennotneeded,becauselimitedev- idence suggests that perioperative opioid therapy might be associated with increased likelihood of long-term opioid use, with its attendant risks.4

Numerous alternative beta blockers are available in lieu of propranolol. Notable among these is the common drug, atenolol, that is available in oral solid dose forms ranging from 25 to 100 mg for the treatment of hypertension. Multiple doses per day may be permitted. It has been used to suppress stage fright in performers when administered orally in advance [45]. Atenolol is a beta-1 selective peripheral-acting agent without CNS effects, which should reduce the risk for asthmatic subjects [46]. Thus, atenolol might be preferred over the nonselective beta blockers for patients affected by asthma or COPD [47]. Oral atenolol at 50 - 200 mg doses suppressed heart rate by ~ 23 - 24 beats per minute (bpm) vs. ~ 10 bpm on placebo [46]. Also,

The results of using an individualized IDF stoplist for each target word show an improvement over us- ing the basic stoplist. The results of our approach using different context descriptions show that for the NLM-WSD dataset the large differences in accuracy makes it unclear which of the context descriptions performed the best.

There are debates about whether the returns generated from the sales of medicines, including cancer medicines, are sufficient for pharmaceutical companies to cover their past R&amp;D expenses, maintain their operations and engage in future drug discovery research. For example, some commentators have observed that the revenue generated from the sales of imatinib had exceeded the costs of R&amp;D within two years and “the revenues over the subsequent years of the patent would represent generous profits to the company” (30). Another study found that total revenue from the sales of 10 cancer medicines since approval over a median of four years (US$ 67.0 billion) was 9.3 times the total R&amp;D spending of US$ 7.2 billion (or 7.4 times using an estimated risk-adjusted R&amp;D costs of US$ 9.1 billion) (94).

In summary, public and non-profit-making sectors, and by extension tax-payers and philanthropists, have provided considerable financial and non-financial contributions towards the R&amp;D of cancer medicines. This means that in many cases, pharmaceutical companies have not incurred the full costs of R&amp;D. The pharmaceutical industry has also benefited greatly from the knowledge generated by public-sector investments in R&amp;D, and by having access to research supported by public funding at costs, if any, lower than the market value.

The TSST method has been used to study the effects of oral propranolol in volunteer subjects [25-28]. The assessments of psychic anxiety can be assessed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) or other similar tools [29,30]. The somatic and psychic effects of oral propranolol were tested using the TSST method in healthy adult volunteers. Propranolol (40 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, reduced systolic blood pressure, and enhanced cognitive flexibility during stress. In another study propranolol (80 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, but paradoxically increased salivary cortisol, and did not significantly affect BP or subjective stress [25]. But, in another TSST study daily oral propranolol (80 mg) did not affect the salivary cortisol response [27].

Profit control is an effective measure to manage medicine prices insofar as the regulators have control over the supply of medicines at certain points along the supply chain. Typically, this means that the regulator needs to have full visibility of the supply and distribution chains. The regulator also needs to have the capacity and ability to enforce non-compliance. Profit control is most effective when there is a publicly- funded universal programme for the provision of medicines. In contrast, it may be much less effective in health care settings where the private sector plays a significant role in the delivery of medicines, or where the structure of supply chain is complex or under-developed (183).

Proper Sizing-Firebox dimensions should be selected so that the fire fills the combustion chamber during operation. This provides greater heating efficiency. Careful consideration should be given to size of the fireplace opening best suited for the room in which it is to be located. Location and size are important not only from the standpoint of appearance, but also of operation. If the fireplace opening is too small, it may function properly but will not produce enough heat to warm the room. If the opening is too large, a fire that would fill the combustion chamber may overwhelm the room. In such a case, the firebox opening would require a larger flue area and consume larger amounts of interior air even if exterior combustion air is provided. Table 2 provides suggested widths of conventional fireplace openings appropriate for various room sizes. For example, a room with 300 ft2 (28 m2) of floor area is best served by a fireplace with an opening 30 in. (750 mm) to 36 in. (900 mm) wide.
What is the purpose of a RA and what makes it a good one, and who decides that it is a good RA? Are there rules for easier writing? If the main function of a RA is to transfer a new knowledge on a research topic, then a good paper is the one that is clear, coherent, focused, well argued and uses language that does not have ambiguous or equivoque meaning. However, it is not only the message that is important. The RA must have a well-defined structure and function in serve like a cook-book, so the others can reproduce and repeat explained experiments. Answer research questions Give summary conclusions There are some rules that can make the writing and publishing of RAs 'easier'. Here, we summarised some 'golden' rules that should always be in the mind of an inexperienced researcher (Table 3). We put all these together to make a final list of some 40 logical steps, which can be find in the Appendix.

For the (2 vs. 2) SVM schema, one can observe from Table 6 that the highest overall accuracy is 0.91 and generated by a feature combination of POS-based unigrams and K-array semantics-based sequential features, regardless of whether WordNet is used to correct the POS of a unigram or not. In terms of the kernel functions, a linear kernel is used at the first level of the SVM model and a polynomial kernel at the second level. In addition, we notice that the inclusion of bigrams (the last four rows in Table 6) does not improve accuracy but rather reduce the accuracy. This agrees with results reported in previous studies. Tables 7 and 8 present the confusion matrices resulted from the two best feature sets using the (2 vs. 2) SVM schema. These two tables elaborate the two optimal feature sets as highlighted in Table 6. Results are obtained by using a linear and a polynomial kernel at the two levels respectively and averaged over 10-fold cross validation. Notice that in certain cases, the model cannot ditinguish between positive and neutral polarities due to the reasons discussed above; while negative and no-relationship can often be correctly identified.

Return-to-sport progressions should be individualised based on the injury, athlete’s age, history and level of play, and the ability to provide close supervision during the return to activity, and progressions may vary between athletes. Each stage is generally 24 hours without return of concussion symptoms. Consider written clearance from a healthcare professional before return to sport as directed by local laws and regulations.3
Antimalarial efficacy screening: in vitro and in vivo protocols. Supplemental file. animals are prepared and stained with Giemsa. Parasitemia is determined microscopically by counting 4 fields of approximately 100 erythrocytes per field. For low parasitemias (&lt;1%), up to 4000 erythrocytes have to be counted. Alternatively the parasitemia can also be determined by FACS analysis, which works particularly well for parasitemias &gt;1%. The difference between the mean value of the control group (taken as 100%) and those of the experimental groups is calculated and expressed as percent reduction (= activity) using the following equation:

□ Alternative Program (Alt): Transitional Bilingual Education: Students with an approved Parental Exception Waiver* receive core instruction initially through their primary language and instruction in ELD from trained and authorized teachers using district-adopted textbooks and supplementary instructional materials. Instruction is based on ELD and grade-level standards. With the goal of English Proficiency, in addition to mastery of core content, the language in which academic subjects are taught gradually shifts from students’ first language to English in order to make academic progress and meet the requirements to be reclassified as fluent English proficient (FEP). Parents may request specific program details for the alternative program at each school site.

Brick has been used to create beautiful buildings for centuries. Most of these structures have a substantial history of outstanding performance. In some instances the appearance is affected by the development of efflorescence or stains. These may originate from materials in the brick or mortar, from adjacent materials, and from outside sourc- es such as cleaning agents. Each has a particular chemical composition and a unique means of removal.
The case definition for reporting includes CRAB isolated from any body site that is resistant to any carbapenem based on current Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines, or that demonstrates the presence or production of a carbapenemase, if such testing is done.

Proper Sizing-Firebox dimensions should be selected so that the fire fills the combustion chamber during operation. This provides greater heating efficiency. Careful consideration should be given to size of the fireplace opening best suited for the room in which it is to be located. Location and size are important not only from the standpoint of appearance, but also of operation. If the fireplace opening is too small, it may function properly but will not produce enough heat to warm the room. If the opening is too large, a fire that would fill the combustion chamber may overwhelm the room. In such a case, the firebox opening would require a larger flue area and consume larger amounts of interior air even if exterior combustion air is provided. Table 2 provides suggested widths of conventional fireplace openings appropriate for various room sizes. For example, a room with 300 ft2 (28 m2) of floor area is best served by a fireplace with an opening 30 in. (750 mm) to 36 in. (900 mm) wide.

When analyzing the data, we found that there does not exist a CUI de(cid:2)nition for a large number of pos- sible concepts. Table 5 shows the number of words in the CUI and ST de(cid:2)nitions for each concept in the NLM-WSD dataset. Only four target words have a CUI de(cid:2)nition for each possible concept. We also found the concept de(cid:2)nitions vary widely in length. The CUI de(cid:2)nitions in the UMLS come from a va- riety of sources and there may exist more than one de(cid:2)nition per source. Unlike CUI de(cid:2)nitions, there does exist an ST de(cid:2)nition for each possible con- cept. The ST de(cid:2)nitions come from the same source and are approximately the same length but they are a broad categorization. We believe this makes them too coarse grained to provide descriptive enough in- formation about their associated concepts.

The TSST method has been used to study the effects of oral propranolol in volunteer subjects [25-28]. The assessments of psychic anxiety can be assessed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) or other similar tools [29,30]. The somatic and psychic effects of oral propranolol were tested using the TSST method in healthy adult volunteers. Propranolol (40 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, reduced systolic blood pressure, and enhanced cognitive flexibility during stress. In another study propranolol (80 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, but paradoxically increased salivary cortisol, and did not significantly affect BP or subjective stress [25]. But, in another TSST study daily oral propranolol (80 mg) did not affect the salivary cortisol response [27].

As reflected in the statutory new drug and new animal drug approval standards in sections 505 109 and 512 of the FD&amp;C Act and the standard for licensure under section 351 of the PHS Act, the 110 evidence that is the basis for the risk assessment of a drug differs from the evidence that is the 111 basis for an effectiveness determination. The effectiveness determination is generally intended 112 to evaluate a drug’s positive effect based on adequate and well-controlled trials designed to 113 evaluate a specific efficacy variable (or a discrete number of efficacy variables) for the purpose 114 of distinguishing the effect of the drug from other influences.11 In contrast, FDA’s premarket 115 risk assessment is intended to identify and characterize the nature, frequency, and severity of the 116 usually broad spectrum of adverse events and other risks associated with the use of a product 117 based on a range of data sources. For human drugs, the supporting data are generally not derived 118 from studies designed to test a specific safety hypothesis. The assessment is based largely on 119 observations of adverse events from studies intended to assess effectiveness and includes all 120 patients exposed to the investigational drug during its development. For animal drugs, there are 121 generally data from safety studies in the target animal, in addition to observations of adverse 122 events from studies intended to assess effectiveness.12 For both human and animal drugs, 123 relevant data are weighted and integrated, based on the nature and reliability of the data sources, 124 into a coherent assessment of what adverse reactions are reasonably associated with the use of a 125 product and, to the extent possible, their frequency and severity.13 126

Objectives of Phase 3. In Phase 3 the working group integrated the findings of the first 2 phases, refined the scoring system, and determined the optimal cut point to define “definite RA.” The goal of this final phase was to utilize the results of Phases 1 and 2 to develop a scoring system that would be applicable to newly presenting patients with undifferentiated inflam- matory arthritis to permit identification of those with a high probability of developing persistent and/or erosive RA. Being intended for use with newly presenting patients, the scoring system should be robust enough that it could be applied repeatedly during the early course of disease, such that a patient identified as not classifiable as having definite RA at initial presentation might be classified as having definite RA at a subsequent time point. The work was not aimed at classifying subjects with established disease, either active or inac- tive. However, the working group recognized that pa- tients may present for the first time with disease that is at a later stage and being treated. Thus, although it was not the explicit charge of the working group to provide

President Obama has recently expressed a strong conviction that “Science offers great potential for improving health”. The President has announced a research initiative that aims to accelerate progress toward a new era of precision medicine. The time is accurate for this idealistic initiative, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other partners will work to attain this vision [7]. The concept of precision medicine speaks of prevention and treatment strategies that take individual variability into account. Even though it is not new, the impact of practicality is still deprived. If one considers blood typing, for instance, has been used to guide blood transfusions for more than a century. But the vision of applying this concept broadly has been intensely improved by the latest development of large-scale biologic databases (such as the human genome sequence), powerful methods for typifying patients (such as proteomics, metabolomics, genomics, diverse cellular assays, and even mobile health technology), and computational tools for analyzing large sets of data. Francis S.Collins et al. stated that, “What is necessary now is a broad

a physician intentionally stimulates a physiologic response by CO 2 inhalation [31], sodium lactate infusion [32,33], or cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4) injection [32,34]. These chemical exposures are used as potent tools to design controlled studies with predictable levels of PA episodes. In a study with healthy volunteer subjects using carbon dioxide inhalation to provoke panic and anxiety, propranolol significantly decreased heart rate, a cardiovascular somatic symptom, but did not provide psychic anxiolytic benefit [35].

The strength and moisture penetration resistance of a brick masonry cavity wall are affected by the mortar selection and compatibility with the brick units. Portland cement-lime, mortar cement, or masonry cement mortars can be used. However, mortars with an air content less than 12 percent are recommended for their superior bond strength and resistance to moisture penetration. The MSJC Code requires that the allowable flexural tensile stresses be reduced by approximately 50 percent for assemblies constructed with masonry cement mortars or portland cement-lime mortars that have air entrainment. In addition, some building codes prohibit the use of masonry cement mortars and all Type N mortars in Seismic Performance Categories D and E (formerly Seismic Zones 3 and 4). Mortar should meet the proportion requirements of ASTM C 270 Specification for Mortar for Unit Masonry as shown in Table 1. Mortar type selection should be based on project requirements, such as strength and compatibility with a particular brick unit. Types N or S mortars are typically used in brick masonry cavity walls. See Technical Notes 8 Series for more detailed information on mortar types and selection.

A similar calculation is performed for each option. The resulting values for the near-term options are then summed and multiplied by 2/T 1. Likewise, the resulting values for the next-term options are summed and multiplied by 2/T 2. The table below summarizes the results for each strip of options.
A patient’s decision to use an OON provider selection may be intentional or accidental. Reasons patients may incur OON costs include patient preference for a particular provider or specialty care center that may be out of network, the lack of network providers with appropriate specialists, and the lack of awareness or transparency about which providers are in the patient’s plan network. Common scenarios for accidental use of OON providers are emergency care or care from an OON provider working at an in-network hospital (e.g., radiologist, assistant surgeon, anesthesiologist).22 23 Figure 9 suggests that there might be significant financial consequences to the patient going out of network, which could be exacerbated if health plans remove popular cancer providers from their networks. Figure 9 also provides information on the relationship between the OON percentage (right vertical axis--relative to total spending) and total patient cost-sharing (left vertical axis). While most patients in our study reported under 10% of all OOP cost in the year of diagnosis is spent on out-of- network providers, those in the highest percentile of OOP spending incurred as much as 40% of those costs out-of-network.

The goals of treatment are to “cure” the cancer, if possible; pro- long survival; and provide the highest possible quality of life during and after treatment. A cancer is cured when all traces of the cancer have been removed from the patient’s body. Although it is usually not possible to know if the cancer is completely eradicated, for many patients, the initial course of therapy is successful and the cancer never returns. However, some cancer- free survivors must cope with the long-term effects of treatment, as well as psychological concerns such as fear of recurrence. Cancer patients, caregivers, and survivors must have the infor- mation and support they need to play an active role in decisions that affect treatment and quality of life.
1. Describing – by clearly defining what you are talking about, what specifically was involved, where it took place and under what circumstances. 2. Reflecting – reconsidering a topic by taking into account new information or a new experience, or considering other viewpoints. 3. Analyzing – examining and then explaining how something is, including comparing and contrasting different elements and understanding relationships to your subject/topic. 4. Critiquing – identifying and examining weaknesses in arguments, as well as acknowledging its strengths. It’s important to think of critiquing as ‘neutral’ and not negative. 5. Reasoning – using methods such as cause and effect to demonstrate logical thinking, as well as presenting evidence that either refutes or proves an argument.

President Obama has recently expressed a strong conviction that “Science offers great potential for improving health”. The President has announced a research initiative that aims to accelerate progress toward a new era of precision medicine. The time is accurate for this idealistic initiative, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other partners will work to attain this vision [7]. The concept of precision medicine speaks of prevention and treatment strategies that take individual variability into account. Even though it is not new, the impact of practicality is still deprived. If one considers blood typing, for instance, has been used to guide blood transfusions for more than a century. But the vision of applying this concept broadly has been intensely improved by the latest development of large-scale biologic databases (such as the human genome sequence), powerful methods for typifying patients (such as proteomics, metabolomics, genomics, diverse cellular assays, and even mobile health technology), and computational tools for analyzing large sets of data. Francis S.Collins et al. stated that, “What is necessary now is a broad

However, as discussed in the text, this may be an underestimate, since it does not include additional risk because of the change in endpoints between parasite reduction in phase IIa (APCR on day 14 or 28) and ACPR day 28 in phase IIb. No additional allowance has been made for the risk that a medicine may fail because it is not possible to produce a pediatric presentation
The numbers in each block are codes for the treatment given to each animal. The purpose of such a design is to reduce heterogeneity associated with time, space and some physical varia- tion. The five animals in Block 1 would be chosen to be as similar as possible with respect to age, weight, genotype and any other variable which might influence the outcome. They would then be assigned at random to one of the five treatments. The animals would be housed in close proximity, and possibly even in the same cage, if the different treatments can be given in such a situation. When measurements are to be made on the animals, those in Block 1 would be treated as a group, with all measurements being made within a short period by the same per- son. Animals in the other blocks would likewise be selected to be as uniform as possible, but might differ in body weight or age, etc. from those in Block 1. They could be measured at a dif- ferent time, if necessary by a different person. Thus, within each block any comparison among treatments would be made on animals which are in all possible ways as similar as possible. The unwanted variation shows up as differences between blocks. This is then removed mathe- matically in the statistical analysis.

We used an expert provided list of 42 relevant domain terms for the Myocardial Perfusion Imaging domain (a sub-domain of nuclear cardiology) to heuristically test the coverage of our ontology terms. Of these, we found 31 exactly matching terms, 2 morphological variants and 8 phrases that contained the terms from the expert list. Out of this 42 domain terms, 1 term, ‘dyperidamole’, was not found in our ontology (dyperidamole is a drug given during pregnancy). We found that this term didn’t exist in the 618 JNC abstracts we were using. Instead, another term, diperidamole (spelling variant) existed in our term list. To do away with noise in our data, we selected terms with greater than average frequency (2.9) of the 10191 retrieved terms and set that as our threshold. We pruned the list to

samples)) / (geometric mean cpm of no drug samples). Percentage reductions are used to plot percentage inhibition of growth as a function of drug concentrations. IC 50 values are determined by linear regression analyses on the linear segments of the curves (IC 90 values can also be determined by curve-fitting and can provide an useful measure of variation between experiments). Assays are typically repeated on two or three separate occasions. Within each experiment, standard deviations are typically less than 10% of the mean. Differences in parasite stages of development can lead to up to two-fold shifts in the IC 50 values between experiments; however, these differences rarely affect the overall relationships between the parasite lines in terms of their differences in drug response 4-11 .

of care data [ 12 ] . The NCI estimate for expenditure on prostate cancer treatment in 2006 was $9.862 billion, and average Medicare payments per patient in the fi rst year after diagnosis were $11 000. It should be noted when interpreting this data that use of PSA testing for prostate cancer is more widespread in the USA than in many other countries, thus increasing the number of cases identifi ed. In addition, Medicare did not cover certain cancer care expenses such as oral medicines, commonly used to treat prostate cancer until January 2006. These out-of-pocket costs may comprise 10% of the $11 000 estimate. Direct medical expenditures are only one part of the total economic burden of cancer, as cancer- related illnesses and death lead to losses in economic productivity.

Many complicated and expensive techniques have been applied extensively in literature to extract relationships and dependencies from data. These techniques generally rely on a deep parse results that gives a rich representation which is used for applications in knowledge extraction and semantics. The problem with biomedical data parsing is that there is no exhaustive tagged training corpus available to build models for efficient parsing on test data. Also, deep parsing is computationally very expensive compared to shallow parsing that uses the finite state automaton techniques. UMLS graciously provides such a shallow parser[7] that is trained on entire Medline corpus and claims to achieve over 97% accuracy.

Insomnia occurs in individuals of all ages and races, and has been observed across all cultures and countries.8,9 The actual prevalence of insomnia varies according to the stringency of the definition used. Insomnia symptoms occur in approximately 33% to 50% of the adult population; insomnia symptoms with dis- tress or impairment (i.e., general insomnia disorder) in 10% to 15%; and specific insomnia disorders in 5% to 10%.10 Consis- tent risk factors for insomnia include increasing age, female sex, comorbid (medical, psychiatric, sleep, and substance use) disor- ders, shift work, and possibly unemployment and lower socio- economic status. Patients with comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions are at particularly increased risk, with psychiatric and chronic pain disorders having insomnia rates as high as 50% to 75%.11-13 The risk relationship between insomnia and psychiatric disorders appears to be bidirectional; several studies have also

Recent analyses of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)- Medicare database tracked healthcare use and costs (projected to 2004 levels) from diagnosis and initial treatment [ 15 ] , in addition to a 4-year follow-up [ 17 ] , for a cohort of 81 659 elderly patients with prostate cancer who had Medicare claims from 1991 to 2003 [ 15 ] , and 1991 to 2004 [ 17 ] , respectively. Treatment in the fi rst year after diagnosis was calculated to incur costs of $21 040 per patient; $13 091 for prostate cancer-related costs and $7949 for medical costs unrelated to prostate cancer [ 15 ] . In terms of cost at each stage, as expected, there was an increase in costs from stage I to IV [ 15,17 ] . Prostate cancer-related costs over 4 years from diagnosis averaged $18 168 per patient [ 17 ] . The annual healthcare cost burden estimated in 2009 is &gt; $2.5 billion annually for initial care alone [ 17 ] .

Composite or combination flashings are typically less expensive than sheet metal and are easier to install. The most predominant type is a thin layer of metal sandwiched between one or two layers of another material. The metal layer is usually of aluminum, copper or lead. It is covered on one or both sides with various materials, such as asphalt coatings, kraft paper, fiberglass fabric or plastic films. Product literature should be reviewed to determine whether these materials are appropriate for use in brick masonry cavity walls. Consideration should be given to compatibility with adjacent sealants, delamination due to moisture penetration and movement of the wall system.

One can reasonably assert that this beneficial anxiolytic effect might have been enhanced even further under three study design conditions. First, if the inclusion criteria had required each patient to have a high anxiety score prior to the procedure, for instance a minimum of 7 points (with 10 as the maximum), there would have been a greater potential for a difference pre-treatment vs. during the procedure. The six responders had a baseline average of 6.3 points, so there was room for improvement. Of the six responders, two subjects had low baseline anxiety scores (i.e., patient F at 4 points and patient I at 2 points). A higher baseline inclusion parameter could have increased the differential prior to vs. during the EMG procedure. Second, there might not have been a sufficiently long waiting period between the drug administration and the procedure. One can reasonably assert that if the time interval between dosing and the procedure was increased to a minimum of 30 minutes or more (from the 10 – 20 minutes), the percentage of responders and the magnitude of the response could have been greater. However, it should be noted that often in a clinic time-is-of-the-essence between the patient’s initial assessment by the medical provider and the subsequent medical procedure. Some medical providers are willing to pre-treat an anxious patient, typically with an oral benzodiazepine either swallowed intact or pre-dissolved in water, and then have him/her wait (e.g., 30 + min.) for an anxiolytic effect to be acknowledged by the patient. But, some physicians and dentists might be under time constraints or might not be willing to oblige the patient this waiting period. This would not be an obstacle if either the drug has a rapid onset of effect or the patient were to pre-treat themselves immediately prior to arrival at the physician’s office, for instance 30-60 minutes in advance. Even under the conditions of this study that the authors consider might have been sub-optimal, this drug combo delivered by the oral mucosal route provided a rapid onset effect as a PRN medication. This anxiolytic benefit may be useful in treating anticipatory anxiety either in-office or prior to arrival. There is a third limitation to this study to consider. The compounded medicine contained 25 mg of atenolol and 0.2 mg of scopolamine HBr.

For the (2 vs. 2) SVM schema, one can observe from Table 6 that the highest overall accuracy is 0.91 and generated by a feature combination of POS-based unigrams and K-array semantics-based sequential features, regardless of whether WordNet is used to correct the POS of a unigram or not. In terms of the kernel functions, a linear kernel is used at the first level of the SVM model and a polynomial kernel at the second level. In addition, we notice that the inclusion of bigrams (the last four rows in Table 6) does not improve accuracy but rather reduce the accuracy. This agrees with results reported in previous studies. Tables 7 and 8 present the confusion matrices resulted from the two best feature sets using the (2 vs. 2) SVM schema. These two tables elaborate the two optimal feature sets as highlighted in Table 6. Results are obtained by using a linear and a polynomial kernel at the two levels respectively and averaged over 10-fold cross validation. Notice that in certain cases, the model cannot ditinguish between positive and neutral polarities due to the reasons discussed above; while negative and no-relationship can often be correctly identified.

Although, it was assumed that the 'thicker' articles with wider range of vocabulary is preferable in the editors hands, the editors (and probably the readers) prefer simple, clear and coherent writing, rather than a fancy or complex, pseudo-scientific style. Also Funkhouser and Maccoby (1971) showed that the information gain is especially enhanced by the “use of examples", i.e. it helps a lot to use some non-science material, such as everyday life parallels, historical points, etc. On the other hand, some sections, such as Introduction and Discussion, have to intrigue readers and attract interest and should therefore not be over-simplified. For example, a mysterious title can catch readers' attention and will be easily remembered (e.g.: T.Y. Li and J. Yorke named their famous paper on chaos: "The period three means chaos"). Some sections require more skill and are more important. It is approximated that from all published journal RAs in the world, only less than 5% are read in detail. However, more than 50% of abstracts are read and so the quality of an abstracts is much more important (Gordon, 1983). Therefore, the abstract should present the 'story' of the RA in miniature and should be readable standalone.

The statewide assessments in mathematics, reading, and science are used to measure whether students, and their school and district, are meeting the academic standards. Statewide assessments are one measure of how well students are doing on the content that is part of their daily instruction. It is also a measure of how well schools and districts are doing in aligning their curriculum and teaching the standards.

Numerous alternative beta blockers are available in lieu of propranolol. Notable among these is the common drug, atenolol, that is available in oral solid dose forms ranging from 25 to 100 mg for the treatment of hypertension. Multiple doses per day may be permitted. It has been used to suppress stage fright in performers when administered orally in advance [45]. Atenolol is a beta-1 selective peripheral-acting agent without CNS effects, which should reduce the risk for asthmatic subjects [46]. Thus, atenolol might be preferred over the nonselective beta blockers for patients affected by asthma or COPD [47]. Oral atenolol at 50 - 200 mg doses suppressed heart rate by ~ 23 - 24 beats per minute (bpm) vs. ~ 10 bpm on placebo [46]. Also,

Properties of insulation materials vary widely. Table 3 shows various properties of insulation materials used in brick masonry cavity walls. The thermal conductivity (k) and thermal resistance (R) provide a means of comparing the insulating properties of insulation materials. These are determined in accordance with ASTM C 177 Test Method for Steady-State Heat Flux Measurements and Thermal Transmission Properties by Means of the Guarded-Hot-Plate Apparatus measured at various temperatures. Due to the large number of types of insulation, and even larger number of manufacturers, Table 3 lists only a few representative values of physical properties. For some materials, an aged or stabilized value is given. In all cases, the aged or stabilized value is the one that should be used in design. Individual manufacturers should be consulted for design values and other properties of their specific materials and their applications.
What is the purpose of a RA and what makes it a good one, and who decides that it is a good RA? Are there rules for easier writing? If the main function of a RA is to transfer a new knowledge on a research topic, then a good paper is the one that is clear, coherent, focused, well argued and uses language that does not have ambiguous or equivoque meaning. However, it is not only the message that is important. The RA must have a well-defined structure and function in serve like a cook-book, so the others can reproduce and repeat explained experiments. Answer research questions Give summary conclusions There are some rules that can make the writing and publishing of RAs 'easier'. Here, we summarised some 'golden' rules that should always be in the mind of an inexperienced researcher (Table 3). We put all these together to make a final list of some 40 logical steps, which can be find in the Appendix.

A patient’s decision to use an OON provider selection may be intentional or accidental. Reasons patients may incur OON costs include patient preference for a particular provider or specialty care center that may be out of network, the lack of network providers with appropriate specialists, and the lack of awareness or transparency about which providers are in the patient’s plan network. Common scenarios for accidental use of OON providers are emergency care or care from an OON provider working at an in-network hospital (e.g., radiologist, assistant surgeon, anesthesiologist).22 23 Figure 9 suggests that there might be significant financial consequences to the patient going out of network, which could be exacerbated if health plans remove popular cancer providers from their networks. Figure 9 also provides information on the relationship between the OON percentage (right vertical axis--relative to total spending) and total patient cost-sharing (left vertical axis). While most patients in our study reported under 10% of all OOP cost in the year of diagnosis is spent on out-of- network providers, those in the highest percentile of OOP spending incurred as much as 40% of those costs out-of-network.

In the future, we would also like to increase the size of our con(cid:3)ated dataset and possibly create a biomedical all-words disambiguation test set to test our approach. Unlike SenseClusters, our approach can be used to perform all-words disambiguation. For example, given the sentence: His weight has fluctuated during the past month. We (cid:2)rst create a instance vector containing fluctuated, past and months for the word weight and a concept vector for each of its possible concepts, (cid:147)C0005912: Body Weight(cid:148) and (cid:147)C0699807: Quantitative Concept(cid:148) us- ing their context descriptions. We then calculate the cosine between the instance vector and each of the two concept vectors. The concept whose vector has the smallest cosine score is assigned to weight. We then repeat this process for fluctuated, past and months. We also plan to explore using different contex- tual information to improve the accuracy of our approach. We are currently exploring using co- occurrence and relational information about the pos- sible CUIs in the UMLS. Our IDF stoplist exper-

the context description CUI→ST obtains the high- est overall accuracy. On the con(cid:3)ated dataset, the pseudowords a a, a o, d d and e e have a corresponding CUI de(cid:2)ni- tion for each of their possible concepts therefore the accuracy for CUI and CUI→ would be the same for these datasets and is not reported. The pseudowords a a i, x p p and d a m e do not have a CUI de(cid:2)ni- tions for each of their possible concepts. The results show that CUI obtained the highest accuracy for six out of the seven datasets and CUI→ST obtained the highest accuracy for one. These experiments were run using the unigram feature.

The increase in full-text downloads for open access articles during their first year after publication suggests that the primary benefit to the nonsubscriber commu- nity is in browsing, as opposed to printing or saving, which would have been indicated by a commensurate increase in PDF downloads. The decrease in abstract views suggests a reader preference for the full docu- ment when available.

In addition to return to learning and sporting environments, older athletes may need to return to driving, where subtle defi- cits could compromise safety. Most sports medicine physicians do not counsel athletes with SRC about driving.90 Driving is a complex process involving coordination of cognitive, visual and motor skills, as well as concentration, attention, visual percep- tion, insight and memory, which can all be affected by SRC.90 Little is known about the risk of driving after SRC, but prelim- inary data suggest some impairment exists when patients with concussion report they are asymptomatic.91 Currently, no widely

Insomnia occurs in individuals of all ages and races, and has been observed across all cultures and countries.8,9 The actual prevalence of insomnia varies according to the stringency of the definition used. Insomnia symptoms occur in approximately 33% to 50% of the adult population; insomnia symptoms with dis- tress or impairment (i.e., general insomnia disorder) in 10% to 15%; and specific insomnia disorders in 5% to 10%.10 Consis- tent risk factors for insomnia include increasing age, female sex, comorbid (medical, psychiatric, sleep, and substance use) disor- ders, shift work, and possibly unemployment and lower socio- economic status. Patients with comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions are at particularly increased risk, with psychiatric and chronic pain disorders having insomnia rates as high as 50% to 75%.11-13 The risk relationship between insomnia and psychiatric disorders appears to be bidirectional; several studies have also
medicine (NMM) and OMM obtain many more hundreds of hours of manual medicine training in a wider variety of clinical settings than DCs and other DOs. This section was meant to give you a better sense of what “osteopathic manipulative medicine” entails, and hopefully it answered most of your questions regarding OMM. The effectiveness of OMM remains a topic of ongoing debate and research despite past and current efforts to lay these arguments to rest. Whether an osteo- pathic physician uses OMM in his or her practice is based entirely on preference. With that said, it is an important core discipline and primary distinction of the osteopathic profession.
We report the results for four experiments in this pa- per: i) the results of using the IDF stoplist over a ba- sic stoplist, ii) the results of our approach using dif- ferent context descriptions of the possible concepts of a target word, iii) the results of our approach com- pared to SenseClusters and Humphrey et al. (2006) using the NLM-WSD dataset, and iv) the results of our approach compared to SenseClusters using the con(cid:3)ated dataset. The results of using an individualized IDF stoplist for each target word show an improvement over us- ing the basic stoplist. The results of our approach using different context descriptions show that for the NLM-WSD dataset the large differences in accuracy makes it unclear which of the context descriptions performed the best. On the con(cid:3)ated dataset, adding the ST de(cid:2)nition to the context description improved

Sleep-inducing drugs (hypnotics) are medications specif- ically designed to induce sleepiness directly after intake. Optimal agents affect cognitive performance during this period while inducing minimal sleepiness in the waking day after use. An optimal hypnotic would have low tox- icity and addictive potential, as well a minimal side effect profile (Oswald 1970). Among the first hypnotics, and an agent still in use is chloral hydrate - the original “Mickey Finn” - slipped into the drinks of unsuspecting marks for the purposes of criminal activity. Unfortu- nately, this medication is difficult to use since the LD-50 (potentially fatal dose) is quite close to the therapeutic dose. In the years leading up to the 1970’s, rapidly acting barbiturates were commonly utilized for their hypnotic effects. Unfortunately, these medications, also drugs of abuse, had a significant danger of overdose and contrib- uted to an era that was characterized in part by deaths due to overdoses of sleeping pills. These medications and similar barbiturate-like medications [Methaqualone (Quaalude, Sopor) Glutethimide (Doriden), Ethchlor- vynol (Placidyl), Methyprylon (Nodudar)] have limited availability and are rarely used due to limited efficacy, cognitive effects, the potential for abuse and lethal tox- icity associated with overdose (Oswald 1970). Today their primary therapeutic uses include executions and fa- cilitated euthanasia (Lossignol 2008). Most currently utilized hypnotics affect the widely dis- persed negative neurotransmitter GABA. In the 1970’s benzodiazepines (GABA agonists) were first marketed as hypnotics. Some of these agents had an extremely short duration of action [Triazolam (Halcion)]. While this agent-induced minimal next day somnolence, use was as- sociated with daytime memory impairment, particularly at higher dosages (Roehrs et al. 2000; Adam and Oswald

Brick has been used to create beautiful buildings for centuries. Most of these structures have a substantial history of outstanding performance. In some instances the appearance is affected by the development of efflorescence or stains. These may originate from materials in the brick or mortar, from adjacent materials, and from outside sourc- es such as cleaning agents. Each has a particular chemical composition and a unique means of removal.

Structural clay tile has been used as a backing material for cavity wall construction. Structural clay tile for this purpose should conform to ASTM C 126, ASTM C 34 Specification for Structural Clay Load-Bearing Wall Tile or ASTM C 212 for Structural Clay Facing Tile. Clay tile units under ASTM C 126 and ASTM C 212 are commonly used for the interior wythe of a cavity wall when left exposed for architectural appearance reasons.

The strength and moisture penetration resistance of a brick masonry cavity wall are affected by the mortar selection and compatibility with the brick units. Portland cement-lime, mortar cement, or masonry cement mortars can be used. However, mortars with an air content less than 12 percent are recommended for their superior bond strength and resistance to moisture penetration. The MSJC Code requires that the allowable flexural tensile stresses be reduced by approximately 50 percent for assemblies constructed with masonry cement mortars or portland cement-lime mortars that have air entrainment. In addition, some building codes prohibit the use of masonry cement mortars and all Type N mortars in Seismic Performance Categories D and E (formerly Seismic Zones 3 and 4). Mortar should meet the proportion requirements of ASTM C 270 Specification for Mortar for Unit Masonry as shown in Table 1. Mortar type selection should be based on project requirements, such as strength and compatibility with a particular brick unit. Types N or S mortars are typically used in brick masonry cavity walls. See Technical Notes 8 Series for more detailed information on mortar types and selection.

The TSST method has been used to study the effects of oral propranolol in volunteer subjects [25-28]. The assessments of psychic anxiety can be assessed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) or other similar tools [29,30]. The somatic and psychic effects of oral propranolol were tested using the TSST method in healthy adult volunteers. Propranolol (40 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, reduced systolic blood pressure, and enhanced cognitive flexibility during stress. In another study propranolol (80 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, but paradoxically increased salivary cortisol, and did not significantly affect BP or subjective stress [25]. But, in another TSST study daily oral propranolol (80 mg) did not affect the salivary cortisol response [27].

What is the purpose of a RA and what makes it a good one, and who decides that it is a good RA? Are there rules for easier writing? If the main function of a RA is to transfer a new knowledge on a research topic, then a good paper is the one that is clear, coherent, focused, well argued and uses language that does not have ambiguous or equivoque meaning. However, it is not only the message that is important. The RA must have a well-defined structure and function in serve like a cook-book, so the others can reproduce and repeat explained experiments. Answer research questions Give summary conclusions There are some rules that can make the writing and publishing of RAs 'easier'. Here, we summarised some 'golden' rules that should always be in the mind of an inexperienced researcher (Table 3). We put all these together to make a final list of some 40 logical steps, which can be find in the Appendix.

Proper Sizing-Firebox dimensions should be selected so that the fire fills the combustion chamber during operation. This provides greater heating efficiency. Careful consideration should be given to size of the fireplace opening best suited for the room in which it is to be located. Location and size are important not only from the standpoint of appearance, but also of operation. If the fireplace opening is too small, it may function properly but will not produce enough heat to warm the room. If the opening is too large, a fire that would fill the combustion chamber may overwhelm the room. In such a case, the firebox opening would require a larger flue area and consume larger amounts of interior air even if exterior combustion air is provided. Table 2 provides suggested widths of conventional fireplace openings appropriate for various room sizes. For example, a room with 300 ft2 (28 m2) of floor area is best served by a fireplace with an opening 30 in. (750 mm) to 36 in. (900 mm) wide.

Sport-specific rules may not allow adequate time for evaluation, and modifying these rules remains an area for improvement within the governing bodies of some sports. (C) When the sports medicine clinician becomes aware of a poten- tial injury, the athlete is approached and a brief history of the event is obtained from the athlete and those who witnessed the event or athlete behaviour. How the athlete responds to the elements of orientation, memory, concentration and balance is evaluated, as well as speech patterns and how the athlete appears to be processing information.

We also extract and treat as binary features four different types of subjects from Altmetric and CrossRef: Medline subject codes for journal (Altmetric), subjects as indexed by SCOPUS (Altmetric), publisher subjects (Altmetric), and CrossRef subjects. Subjects are mostly at the granularity of the journal or higher. Similar journals have subjects in com- mon, with, for instance, the journals Nature Conservation, Conservation Biology, Ecology and Evolution, and many more sharing the CrossRef subject “nature and landscape conservation.”Multidisciplinaryjournals,suchasPNASand Nature, are often tagged with more general subjects such as “science” or “multidisciplinary.” Table 2 displays the top 10 CrossRef subjects describing at least 100 articles by aver- age news coverage. As expected, health related subjects top the list, along with those related to the environment. Unfor- tunately, but as expected, “general computer science” and “computational mathematics” secured the last places, at 0.5 and 0.3 news articles on average, respectively. We also extract textual features, when available, for each document: Title, Abstract, Press Release. For scientific ar- ticles with more than one press release, we randomly select one. For each type of text document, we preprocess using a standard English stop word list, extracting counts of un- igrams and bigrams, keeping tokens which appear in more than one document and no more than 80% of documents of the same type in the training set. We keep the 30,000 most frequently occurring features in the training set. We then scale the vectors of counts by tfidf weights fit on the training set. Finally, we create a boolean feature hasPR indicating whether the scientific article received coverage on one of the two prominent press release aggregation websites, Eu- rekAlert! or Science Daily. We hypothesize that mention on one of these would expose the scientific article to more jour- nalists and thus garner more coverage.
While many patients in the study were protected by OOP maximum features embedded in their insurance, for 2011-2013, we capped annual OOP costs at a maximum comparable to that set by the Affordable Care Act for 2014, when the OOP maximum first became mandatory.

The TSST method has been used to study the effects of oral propranolol in volunteer subjects [25-28]. The assessments of psychic anxiety can be assessed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) or other similar tools [29,30]. The somatic and psychic effects of oral propranolol were tested using the TSST method in healthy adult volunteers. Propranolol (40 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, reduced systolic blood pressure, and enhanced cognitive flexibility during stress. In another study propranolol (80 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, but paradoxically increased salivary cortisol, and did not significantly affect BP or subjective stress [25]. But, in another TSST study daily oral propranolol (80 mg) did not affect the salivary cortisol response [27].

Results from the tests showed that the average value of critical thinking ability to the average achievement after the testing ended, showed the relationship was statistically significant (.05). As a result, the researchers compared the results of Table 4 and determined that after the posttest, data showed the average of critical thinking ability and post-learning achievement were higher than before the study.

medically related text and metadata features, such as “pa- tients,” “alzheimer,” “health information management,” and “medicine” are also important and of mostly positive polar- ity, since medical articles attract greater news coverage than, say, a recently published computer science paper. As we dis- cuss later, the presence of “alzheimer” as an important, neg- ative feature is more an artifact of the dataset than an iden- tification of trends in popularity. We also find an artifact of year (2016) of the dataset with the feature “zika virus,” due to the 2015-2016 zika epidemic in North and South Amer- ica.

Based on the size of the flue selected, a preliminary damper size must be assumed. At this point in the design process, it is only necessary to decide if the damper throat area to be used will be equal to or twice the flue area. Once this decision has been made the Inlet Loss Coefficient, K 2, may be determined. If the damper throat area is equal to the flue area, K 2 is equal to 2.5. If the damper throat is twice the flue area, K 2 is equal to 1.0.

AASM practice parameter papers are based on evidence- based review and grading of literature, often addressing a spe- cific issue or topic. Clinical guidelines provide clinicians with a working overview for disease or disorder evaluation and man- agement. These guidelines include practice parameter papers and also include areas with limited evidence in order to provide a comprehensive practice guideline. Both practice parameters and clinical guidelines define principles of practice that should meet the needs of most patients. They should not, however, be considered exhaustive, inclusive of all available methods of care, or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably expected to obtain the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding appropriateness of any specific therapy must be made by the clinician and patient in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible

a) The regulation gives data subjects the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, where there is a legal or similarly significant effect on the person (the regulation prohibits automated processing where there is no meaningful human involvement in the decision and where the decision either impacts one’s legal rights, or the decision has the potential to significantly influence the circumstances, behavior, or choices of the individuals concerned). b) Other considerations: i) Research affecting the healthcare a person receives, where there is no human involvement in the decision, would be considered covered under the regulation (i.e., assigning trial subjects to receive an intervention or placebo, based solely on the individual’s personal data, i.e., test results)

The key idea is that you should read the paper in up to three passes, instead of starting at the beginning and plow- ing your way to the end. Each pass accomplishes specific goals and builds upon the previous pass: The first pass gives you a general idea about the paper. The second pass lets you grasp the paper’s content, but not its details. The third pass helps you understand the paper in depth.
1. Decide when to clean. Mortar must harden prior to cleaning. It is generally best to schedule cleaning at least seven days after brickwork is completed. In some cases it may be possible to clean earlier; how- ever, effects on the masonry and influencing factors such as weather conditions and the type of brick and mortar should be carefully considered. Prolonged time periods between the completion of the masonry and cleaning should be avoided. After one month, mortar smears and splatters left on brickwork become increasingly difficult to remove. 2. Remove larger clumps of mortar using wooden paddles or nonmetallic tools. Metal tools may damage the brickwork or leave behind fragments that oxidize and cause rust stains. 3. Select the proper cleaning solution. There are many types of proprietary cleaners available that are for- mulated to remove specific stains or for use with a particular type of brick. Be careful to select cleaning products suitable for the brick, mortar and adjacent materials and follow the cleaner manufacturer’s rec- ommended instructions. Each product being considered should be evaluated as discussed previously in Trial Cleaning.

With some variation over time and across cancer types, care for the cancer population involves the six categories of services analyzed. The bars in Figures 2a-2c indicate that some patients had significant use of facility services in the year preceding the cancer diagnosis. For both colorectal and lung cancers, total spending on hospital inpatient increased as a percentage of total immediately following diagnosis. In all three cancers, the chemotherapy share of total spending increased rapidly in the first few months after diagnosis and, with the exception of breast cancer, continued at a fairly consistent level of around 20% of spending in subsequent years. Radiation therapy represented a small share of total spending except for breast cancer patients in the year following diagnosis.

Efflorescence is normally a harmless deposit of water- soluble, white salt crystals, as shown in Photo 1. In some instances efflorescence may appear on mortar joints as shown in Photo 2. Efflorescence may appear in limited areas on the surface of brickwork as shown in Photo 3 or, in extreme cases, cover the entire brickwork surface.
ability to sleep and the daytime consequences of poor sleep, dis- torted beliefs and attitudes about the origins and meaning of the insomnia, maladaptive efforts to accommodate to the condition (e.g., schedule or lifestyle changes), and excessive time spent awake in bed. The latter behavior is of particular significance in that it often is associated with “trying hard” to fall asleep and growing frustration and tension in the face of wakefulness. Thus, the bed becomes associated with a state of waking arousal as this conditioning paradigm repeats itself night after night.
These assignment guidelines pertain exclusively to Commercial Mobile Radio Service providers (CMRS). The IMSI Administrator directly administers only the Home Network Identity (HNI) segment of the resource. The HNI uniquely identifies the home wireless network of a FCC- licensed two-way CMRS subscriber and contains the Mobile Country Code (MCC) and the Mobile Network Code (MNC). The remaining segment of the IMSI, the Mobile Station Identification Number (MSIN), is directly administered by the wireless network licensee to which the HNI is assigned. Issue: In 1998, ITU Recommendation E.212 was modified allowing IMSI assignments to those Wireline Service Providers offering limited mobility services. As a result, HNI assignments are no longer available exclusively to CMRS providers. The current IMSI assignment and administrative guidelines do not however reflect these modifications.

The goals of treatment are to “cure” the cancer, if possible; pro- long survival; and provide the highest possible quality of life during and after treatment. A cancer is cured when all traces of the cancer have been removed from the patient’s body. Although it is usually not possible to know if the cancer is completely eradicated, for many patients, the initial course of therapy is successful and the cancer never returns. However, some cancer- free survivors must cope with the long-term effects of treatment, as well as psychological concerns such as fear of recurrence. Cancer patients, caregivers, and survivors must have the infor- mation and support they need to play an active role in decisions that affect treatment and quality of life.

The IOM report supports these findings, stating that diagnostic errors contribute to 10% of patient deaths and 6-17% of hospital adverse events. Other researchers quantify the human cost of diagnostic errors at between 40,000 and 80,000 deaths per year.9 These troubling findings make developing effective methods to prevent diagnostic errors an urgent priority.
1. Describing – by clearly defining what you are talking about, what specifically was involved, where it took place and under what circumstances. 2. Reflecting – reconsidering a topic by taking into account new information or a new experience, or considering other viewpoints. 3. Analyzing – examining and then explaining how something is, including comparing and contrasting different elements and understanding relationships to your subject/topic. 4. Critiquing – identifying and examining weaknesses in arguments, as well as acknowledging its strengths. It’s important to think of critiquing as ‘neutral’ and not negative. 5. Reasoning – using methods such as cause and effect to demonstrate logical thinking, as well as presenting evidence that either refutes or proves an argument.

O ceratocone, a degeneração marginal pelúcida e ectasia pós-cirurgia refrativa são doenças que causam afilamento e abaulamento da córnea (estrutura transparente que forma a parede anterior do globo ocular). Estas alterações provocam astigmatismo irregular com distorção visual importante. O grau de embaçamento visual vai depender do grau de astigmatismo produzido e da existência de outras alterações oculares associadas. Astigmatismo pós-transplante de córnea é um grau residual que ocorre dependendo da intera- ção entre córnea doada e receptor (coaptação, cicatrização, abertura e frouxidão de pontos no decorrer da cicatrização e sua retirada).

A patient’s decision to use an OON provider selection may be intentional or accidental. Reasons patients may incur OON costs include patient preference for a particular provider or specialty care center that may be out of network, the lack of network providers with appropriate specialists, and the lack of awareness or transparency about which providers are in the patient’s plan network. Common scenarios for accidental use of OON providers are emergency care or care from an OON provider working at an in-network hospital (e.g., radiologist, assistant surgeon, anesthesiologist).22 23 Figure 9 suggests that there might be significant financial consequences to the patient going out of network, which could be exacerbated if health plans remove popular cancer providers from their networks. Figure 9 also provides information on the relationship between the OON percentage (right vertical axis--relative to total spending) and total patient cost-sharing (left vertical axis). While most patients in our study reported under 10% of all OOP cost in the year of diagnosis is spent on out-of- network providers, those in the highest percentile of OOP spending incurred as much as 40% of those costs out-of-network.

Return-to-sport progressions should be individualised based on the injury, athlete’s age, history and level of play, and the ability to provide close supervision during the return to activity, and progressions may vary between athletes. Each stage is generally 24 hours without return of concussion symptoms. Consider written clearance from a healthcare professional before return to sport as directed by local laws and regulations.3

The analysis found that low-income countries could spend on average up to US$ 3800 per cancer patient annually on cancer medicines for all newly-diagnosed cancer patients, and the total expenditure on these medicines would be within the generously assumed 5% of the total health expenditure (Table 4.2). In high- income countries, the analysis found that a budget threshold of 5% of the total health expenditure would allow a spending of up to US$ 40 600 on cancer medicines per patient per year, with a view to providing universal coverage.

return-to-sport progression is individualised and is a function of the injury, the athlete’s age, prior SRC and level of play, and the ability to provide close supervision during the return to activity. The return-to-sport progression presented by the CISG is widely accepted but empiric, without evidence to support either the progression sequence or the time spent in each stage. In general, for young athletes, each stage of the progression should be at least 24 hours without return of symptoms before progressing to the next stage. (C)

6. Evaluating – can include commenting on the degrees of success and failure of something, or the value of something The ability to analyze and creatively adapt to new situations is at the heart of critical thinking. Paul and Elder (2008, 2014b) asserted that critical thinking provides a vehicle for educating the mind. John Dewey would agree, as from his early work, we have increased our sense of the pragmatic basis of human thought (its instrumental nature), and especially its grounding in actual human purposes, goals, and objectives. Dewey (1910) also discussed critical thinking in terms of reflective thinking, which is an uneasiness in accepting the status quo and that critical thinking is both an emotional and intellectual component. Students must, therefore, be taught to examine, poke, question, and reflect on what they have learned. Scepticism, questioning, and reflection is essential. Dewey also stated that schools should have an intimate relationship with the community it serves. From the review of the research concerning critical thinking and what components are considered important in high school education and later a life-long learning skill, the authors developed a 5-step, critical thinking teaching process as outlined in Table 2. Input from the study’s nine experts who reviewed the model and from suggestions from other model developers, led to the selection of easy to remember letters that describe each step’s process.

Brick has been used to create beautiful buildings for centuries. Most of these structures have a substantial history of outstanding performance. In some instances the appearance is affected by the development of efflorescence or stains. These may originate from materials in the brick or mortar, from adjacent materials, and from outside sourc- es such as cleaning agents.

• Mood disturbances and cognitive difficulties. Complaints of irritability, loss of interest, mild depression and anxi- ety are common among insomnia patients. Patients with chronic insomnia often complain of mental inefficiency, difficulty remembering, difficulty focusing attention, and difficulty with complex mental tasks. • Quality of life: The irritability and fatigue associated with insomnia may cause interpersonal difficulties for insomnia patients, or avoidance of such activities. Conversely, in- terpersonal difficulties may be an important contributor to insomnia problems for some individuals. Sleep and wak- ing problems may lead to restriction of daytime activities, including social events, exercise, or work. Lack of regular daytime activities and exercise may in turn contribute to insomnia. • Exacerbation of comorbid conditions. Comorbid condi- tions may cause or increase sleep difficulties. Likewise, poor sleep may exacerbate symptomatology of comorbid conditions. Sleep complaints may herald the onset of mood disorders or exacerbation of comorbid conditions. VI. Other History: A complete insomnia history also in- cludes medical, psychiatric, medication/substance, and family/ social/occupational histories. A wide range of medical (Table 5) and psychiatric (Table 6) conditions can be comorbid with

concussion tests. If it is clear an athlete has an SRC, additional sideline testing can be discontinued. Sport-specific rules may not allow adequate time for evaluation, and modifying these rules remains an area for improvement within the governing bodies of some sports. (C) When the sports medicine clinician becomes aware of a poten- tial injury, the athlete is approached and a brief history of the event is obtained from the athlete and those who witnessed the event or athlete behaviour. How the athlete responds to the elements of orientation, memory, concentration and balance is evaluated, as well as speech patterns and how the athlete appears to be processing information. Cervical palpation and range of motion (ROM) are also typically performed to assess for other
of care data [ 12 ] . The NCI estimate for expenditure on prostate cancer treatment in 2006 was $9.862 billion, and average Medicare payments per patient in the fi rst year after diagnosis were $11 000. It should be noted when interpreting this data that use of PSA testing for prostate cancer is more widespread in the USA than in many other countries, thus increasing the number of cases identifi ed. In addition, Medicare did not cover certain cancer care expenses such as oral medicines, commonly used to treat prostate cancer until January 2006. These out-of-pocket costs may comprise 10% of the $11 000 estimate. Direct medical expenditures are only one part of the total economic burden of cancer, as cancer- related illnesses and death lead to losses in economic productivity.

Results from the tests showed that the average value of critical thinking ability to the average achievement after the testing ended, showed the relationship was statistically significant (.05). As a result, the researchers compared the results of Table 4 and determined that after the posttest, data showed the average of critical thinking ability and post-learning achievement were higher than before the study.

the fact that 11 of the 12 medicines approved by the United States Food &amp; Drug Administration (US FDA) in 2012 for various cancer indications were priced above US$ 100 000 per year. The experts asserted that the prices of these medicines were too high, unsustainable, might compromise access of needy patients to highly effective therapy, and harmful to the sustainability of national health care systems (30). Similarly, in 2015, yet another group of cancer experts have petitioned for lower medicine prices (31).

Objectives of Phase 3. In Phase 3 the working group integrated the findings of the first 2 phases, refined the scoring system, and determined the optimal cut point to define “definite RA.” The goal of this final phase was to utilize the results of Phases 1 and 2 to develop a scoring system that would be applicable to newly presenting patients with undifferentiated inflam- matory arthritis to permit identification of those with a high probability of developing persistent and/or erosive RA. Being intended for use with newly presenting patients, the scoring system should be robust enough that it could be applied repeatedly during the early course of disease, such that a patient identified as not classifiable as having definite RA at initial presentation might be classified as having definite RA at a subsequent time point. The work was not aimed at classifying subjects with established disease, either active or inac- tive. However, the working group recognized that pa- tients may present for the first time with disease that is at a later stage and being treated. Thus, although it was not the explicit charge of the working group to provide

Dose ranging test: Here, compounds are tested at a minimum of 4 different doses (the “dose ranging, full 4-day test”, typically 100, 30, 10 and 3 mg/kg, by both s.c. and p.o. routes of administration). ED 50 and ED 90 values are calculated by plotting the log dose against probit activity (for example, using Microcal “Origin”). These reflect the drug concentrations at which 50% and 90% of suppression of parasitemia is achieved. Note that with short half-life drugs it may be necessary to dose multiple times per day. Two other parameters measured in this study are relative potency compared to an appropriate standard drug, and oral bioavailability (assessed by comparison of oral and parenteral administration).

Readership analysis was conducted on the 20 science journals in our data set (n(cid:1)2903). Articles published in the social sciences and humanities journals (n(cid:1)350) were omitted from the readership analysis, as many did not include abstract or full-text versions of their articles, and, in some cases, refer- ence views were added to full-text views, resulting in indeter- minate and incomparable results. Citation analyses were conducted on the entire article data set (n(cid:1)3245). A logistic regression model was used to estimate the likelihood of articles in each experimental group being cited within the first year after publication, controlling for journal and journal category effects.

Properties of insulation materials vary widely. Table 3 shows various properties of insulation materials used in brick masonry cavity walls. The thermal conductivity (k) and thermal resistance (R) provide a means of comparing the insulating properties of insulation materials. These are determined in accordance with ASTM C 177 Test Method for Steady-State Heat Flux Measurements and Thermal Transmission Properties by Means of the Guarded-Hot-Plate Apparatus measured at various temperatures. Due to the large number of types of insulation, and even larger number of manufacturers, Table 3 lists only a few representative values of physical properties. For some materials, an aged or stabilized value is given. In all cases, the aged or stabilized value is the one that should be used in design. Individual manufacturers should be consulted for design values and other properties of their specific materials and their applications.

The analysis found that low-income countries could spend on average up to US$ 3800 per cancer patient annually on cancer medicines for all newly-diagnosed cancer patients, and the total expenditure on these medicines would be within the generously assumed 5% of the total health expenditure (Table 4.2). In high- income countries, the analysis found that a budget threshold of 5% of the total health expenditure would allow a spending of up to US$ 40 600 on cancer medicines per patient per year, with a view to providing universal coverage.

For the (2 vs. 2) SVM schema, one can observe from Table 6 that the highest overall accuracy is 0.91 and generated by a feature combination of POS-based unigrams and K-array semantics-based sequential features, regardless of whether WordNet is used to correct the POS of a unigram or not. In terms of the kernel functions, a linear kernel is used at the first level of the SVM model and a polynomial kernel at the second level. In addition, we notice that the inclusion of bigrams (the last four rows in Table 6) does not improve accuracy but rather reduce the accuracy. This agrees with results reported in previous studies. Tables 7 and 8 present the confusion matrices resulted from the two best feature sets using the (2 vs. 2) SVM schema. These two tables elaborate the two optimal feature sets as highlighted in Table 6. Results are obtained by using a linear and a polynomial kernel at the two levels respectively and averaged over 10-fold cross validation. Notice that in certain cases, the model cannot ditinguish between positive and neutral polarities due to the reasons discussed above; while negative and no-relationship can often be correctly identified.

A patient’s decision to use an OON provider selection may be intentional or accidental. Reasons patients may incur OON costs include patient preference for a particular provider or specialty care center that may be out of network, the lack of network providers with appropriate specialists, and the lack of awareness or transparency about which providers are in the patient’s plan network. Common scenarios for accidental use of OON providers are emergency care or care from an OON provider working at an in-network hospital (e.g., radiologist, assistant surgeon, anesthesiologist).22 23 Figure 9 suggests that there might be significant financial consequences to the patient going out of network, which could be exacerbated if health plans remove popular cancer providers from their networks. Figure 9 also provides information on the relationship between the OON percentage (right vertical axis--relative to total spending) and total patient cost-sharing (left vertical axis). While most patients in our study reported under 10% of all OOP cost in the year of diagnosis is spent on out-of- network providers, those in the highest percentile of OOP spending incurred as much as 40% of those costs out-of-network.

There are debates about whether the returns generated from the sales of medicines, including cancer medicines, are sufficient for pharmaceutical companies to cover their past R&amp;D expenses, maintain their operations and engage in future drug discovery research. For example, some commentators have observed that the revenue generated from the sales of imatinib had exceeded the costs of R&amp;D within two years and “the revenues over the subsequent years of the patent would represent generous profits to the company” (30). Another study found that total revenue from the sales of 10 cancer medicines since approval over a median of four years (US$ 67.0 billion) was 9.3 times the total R&amp;D spending of US$ 7.2 billion (or 7.4 times using an estimated risk-adjusted R&amp;D costs of US$ 9.1 billion) (94).
The statewide assessments in mathematics, reading, and science are used to measure whether students, and their school and district, are meeting the academic standards. Statewide assessments are one measure of how well students are doing on the content that is part of their daily instruction. It is also a measure of how well schools and districts are doing in aligning their curriculum and teaching the standards.

The TSST method has been used to study the effects of oral propranolol in volunteer subjects [25-28]. The assessments of psychic anxiety can be assessed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) or other similar tools [29,30]. The somatic and psychic effects of oral propranolol were tested using the TSST method in healthy adult volunteers. Propranolol (40 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, reduced systolic blood pressure, and enhanced cognitive flexibility during stress. In another study propranolol (80 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, but paradoxically increased salivary cortisol, and did not significantly affect BP or subjective stress [25]. But, in another TSST study daily oral propranolol (80 mg) did not affect the salivary cortisol response [27].

Sport-specific rules may not allow adequate time for evaluation, and modifying these rules remains an area for improvement within the governing bodies of some sports. (C) When the sports medicine clinician becomes aware of a poten- tial injury, the athlete is approached and a brief history of the event is obtained from the athlete and those who witnessed the event or athlete behaviour. How the athlete responds to the elements of orientation, memory, concentration and balance is evaluated, as well as speech patterns and how the athlete appears to be processing information.

6. Evaluating – can include commenting on the degrees of success and failure of something, or the value of something The ability to analyze and creatively adapt to new situations is at the heart of critical thinking. Paul and Elder (2008, 2014b) asserted that critical thinking provides a vehicle for educating the mind. John Dewey would agree, as from his early work, we have increased our sense of the pragmatic basis of human thought (its instrumental nature), and especially its grounding in actual human purposes, goals, and objectives. Dewey (1910) also discussed critical thinking in terms of reflective thinking, which is an uneasiness in accepting the status quo and that critical thinking is both an emotional and intellectual component. Students must, therefore, be taught to examine, poke, question, and reflect on what they have learned. Scepticism, questioning, and reflection is essential. Dewey also stated that schools should have an intimate relationship with the community it serves. From the review of the research concerning critical thinking and what components are considered important in high school education and later a life-long learning skill, the authors developed a 5-step, critical thinking teaching process as outlined in Table 2. Input from the study’s nine experts who reviewed the model and from suggestions from other model developers, led to the selection of easy to remember letters that describe each step’s process.

1. Describing – by clearly defining what you are talking about, what specifically was involved, where it took place and under what circumstances. 2. Reflecting – reconsidering a topic by taking into account new information or a new experience, or considering other viewpoints. 3. Analyzing – examining and then explaining how something is, including comparing and contrasting different elements and understanding relationships to your subject/topic. 4. Critiquing – identifying and examining weaknesses in arguments, as well as acknowledging its strengths. It’s important to think of critiquing as ‘neutral’ and not negative. 5. Reasoning – using methods such as cause and effect to demonstrate logical thinking, as well as presenting evidence that either refutes or proves an argument.

2.  Assessing  comparative  cost-effectiveness
As reflected in the statutory new drug and new animal drug approval standards in sections 505 109 and 512 of the FD&amp;C Act and the standard for licensure under section 351 of the PHS Act, the 110 evidence that is the basis for the risk assessment of a drug differs from the evidence that is the 111 basis for an effectiveness determination. The effectiveness determination is generally intended 112 to evaluate a drug’s positive effect based on adequate and well-controlled trials designed to 113 evaluate a specific efficacy variable (or a discrete number of efficacy variables) for the purpose 114 of distinguishing the effect of the drug from other influences.11 In contrast, FDA’s premarket 115 risk assessment is intended to identify and characterize the nature, frequency, and severity of the 116 usually broad spectrum of adverse events and other risks associated with the use of a product 117 based on a range of data sources. For human drugs, the supporting data are generally not derived 118 from studies designed to test a specific safety hypothesis. The assessment is based largely on 119 observations of adverse events from studies intended to assess effectiveness and includes all 120 patients exposed to the investigational drug during its development. For animal drugs, there are 121 generally data from safety studies in the target animal, in addition to observations of adverse 122 events from studies intended to assess effectiveness.12 For both human and animal drugs, 123 relevant data are weighted and integrated, based on the nature and reliability of the data sources, 124 into a coherent assessment of what adverse reactions are reasonably associated with the use of a 125 product and, to the extent possible, their frequency and severity.13 126

For the (2 vs. 2) SVM schema, one can observe from Table 6 that the highest overall accuracy is 0.91 and generated by a feature combination of POS-based unigrams and K-array semantics-based sequential features, regardless of whether WordNet is used to correct the POS of a unigram or not. In terms of the kernel functions, a linear kernel is used at the first level of the SVM model and a polynomial kernel at the second level. In addition, we notice that the inclusion of bigrams (the last four rows in Table 6) does not improve accuracy but rather reduce the accuracy. This agrees with results reported in previous studies. Tables 7 and 8 present the confusion matrices resulted from the two best feature sets using the (2 vs. 2) SVM schema. These two tables elaborate the two optimal feature sets as highlighted in Table 6. Results are obtained by using a linear and a polynomial kernel at the two levels respectively and averaged over 10-fold cross validation. Notice that in certain cases, the model cannot ditinguish between positive and neutral polarities due to the reasons discussed above; while negative and no-relationship can often be correctly identified.
Objectives of Phase 3. In Phase 3 the working group integrated the findings of the first 2 phases, refined the scoring system, and determined the optimal cut point to define “definite RA.” The goal of this final phase was to utilize the results of Phases 1 and 2 to develop a scoring system that would be applicable to newly presenting patients with undifferentiated inflam- matory arthritis to permit identification of those with a high probability of developing persistent and/or erosive RA. Being intended for use with newly presenting patients, the scoring system should be robust enough that it could be applied repeatedly during the early course of disease, such that a patient identified as not classifiable as having definite RA at initial presentation might be classified as having definite RA at a subsequent time point. The work was not aimed at classifying subjects with established disease, either active or inac- tive. However, the working group recognized that pa- tients may present for the first time with disease that is at a later stage and being treated. Thus, although it was not the explicit charge of the working group to provide

In the future, we would also like to increase the size of our con(cid:3)ated dataset and possibly create a biomedical all-words disambiguation test set to test our approach. Unlike SenseClusters, our approach can be used to perform all-words disambiguation. For example, given the sentence: His weight has fluctuated during the past month. We (cid:2)rst create a instance vector containing fluctuated, past and months for the word weight and a concept vector for each of its possible concepts, (cid:147)C0005912: Body Weight(cid:148) and (cid:147)C0699807: Quantitative Concept(cid:148) us- ing their context descriptions. We then calculate the cosine between the instance vector and each of the two concept vectors. The concept whose vector has the smallest cosine score is assigned to weight. We then repeat this process for fluctuated, past and months. We also plan to explore using different contex- tual information to improve the accuracy of our approach. We are currently exploring using co- occurrence and relational information about the pos- sible CUIs in the UMLS. Our IDF stoplist exper-

Incidentally, when you write a paper, you can expect most reviewers (and readers) to make only one pass over it. Take care to choose coherent section and sub-section titles and to write concise and comprehensive abstracts. If a reviewer cannot understand the gist after one pass, the paper will likely be rejected; if a reader cannot understand the high- lights of the paper after five minutes, the paper will likely never be read.

We report the results for four experiments in this pa- per: i) the results of using the IDF stoplist over a ba- sic stoplist, ii) the results of our approach using dif- ferent context descriptions of the possible concepts of a target word, iii) the results of our approach com- pared to SenseClusters and Humphrey et al. (2006) using the NLM-WSD dataset, and iv) the results of our approach compared to SenseClusters using the con(cid:3)ated dataset. The results of using an individualized IDF stoplist for each target word show an improvement over us- ing the basic stoplist. The results of our approach using different context descriptions show that for the NLM-WSD dataset the large differences in accuracy makes it unclear which of the context descriptions performed the best.

Effective immediately, hospitals shall notify an EMS provider if a patient transported to the hospital by that provider’s EMS crew subsequently tests positive for the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus. Notification must occur within 48 hours of the positive test result. This is a change from the previous 12-hour notification requirement. Notification of a positive test result is required regardless of whether CDC’s recommended use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during transport of any individual with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 was observed. Notification shall not include the name of the patient who tested positive.

Numerous alternative beta blockers are available in lieu of propranolol. Notable among these is the common drug, atenolol, that is available in oral solid dose forms ranging from 25 to 100 mg for the treatment of hypertension. Multiple doses per day may be permitted. It has been used to suppress stage fright in performers when administered orally in advance [45]. Atenolol is a beta-1 selective peripheral-acting agent without CNS effects, which should reduce the risk for asthmatic subjects [46]. Thus, atenolol might be preferred over the nonselective beta blockers for patients affected by asthma or COPD [47]. Oral atenolol at 50 - 200 mg doses suppressed heart rate by ~ 23 - 24 beats per minute (bpm) vs. ~ 10 bpm on placebo [46]. Also,
With some variation over time and across cancer types, care for the cancer population involves the six categories of services analyzed. The bars in Figures 2a-2c indicate that some patients had significant use of facility services in the year preceding the cancer diagnosis. For both colorectal and lung cancers, total spending on hospital inpatient increased as a percentage of total immediately following diagnosis. In all three cancers, the chemotherapy share of total spending increased rapidly in the first few months after diagnosis and, with the exception of breast cancer, continued at a fairly consistent level of around 20% of spending in subsequent years. Radiation therapy represented a small share of total spending except for breast cancer patients in the year following diagnosis.

In summary, public and non-profit-making sectors, and by extension tax-payers and philanthropists, have provided considerable financial and non-financial contributions towards the R&amp;D of cancer medicines. This means that in many cases, pharmaceutical companies have not incurred the full costs of R&amp;D. The pharmaceutical industry has also benefited greatly from the knowledge generated by public-sector investments in R&amp;D, and by having access to research supported by public funding at costs, if any, lower than the market value.

Some countries may place limits on the frequency and magnitude of price increments, or even impose a price freeze or price reduction (161,184). In the latter, pharmaceutical prices cannot be raised for a predetermined period of time unless there is a justification. For example, since August 2010 (and at least until 2022), Germany has implemented a moratorium to halt price increase for medicines that are not subject to reference pricing, except for inflation (185).

(cid:2) The panel recommends that clinicians offer multi- modal analgesia, or the use of a variety of analgesic medications and techniques combined with non- pharmacological interventions, for the treatment of postoperative pain in children and adults (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Multimodal analgesia, defined as the use of a variety of analgesic medication and techniques that target different mechanisms of action in the peripheral and/or central nervous system (which might also be combined with nonpharmacological interventions) might have ad- ditiveorsynergisticeffectsandmoreeffectivepainrelief compared with single-modality interventions. For example, clinicians might offer local anesthetic-based regional (peripheral and neuraxial) analgesic techniques in combination with systemic opioids and other analge- sics as part of a multimodal approach to perioperative pain. Because of the availability of effective nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies for postop- erative pain management, the panel suggests that clini- cians routinely incorporate around the clock nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies into multi- modal analgesia regimens. Systemic opioids might not be required in all patients. One study suggests that it shouldbeavoidedwhennotneeded,becauselimitedev- idence suggests that perioperative opioid therapy might be associated with increased likelihood of long-term opioid use, with its attendant risks.4

Readership analysis was conducted on the 20 science journals in our data set (n(cid:1)2903). Articles published in the social sciences and humanities journals (n(cid:1)350) were omitted from the readership analysis, as many did not include abstract or full-text versions of their articles, and, in some cases, refer- ence views were added to full-text views, resulting in indeter- minate and incomparable results. Citation analyses were conducted on the entire article data set (n(cid:1)3245). A logistic regression model was used to estimate the likelihood of articles in each experimental group being cited within the first year after publication, controlling for journal and journal category effects.

a) The regulation gives data subjects the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, where there is a legal or similarly significant effect on the person (the regulation prohibits automated processing where there is no meaningful human involvement in the decision and where the decision either impacts one’s legal rights, or the decision has the potential to significantly influence the circumstances, behavior, or choices of the individuals concerned). b) Other considerations: i) Research affecting the healthcare a person receives, where there is no human involvement in the decision, would be considered covered under the regulation (i.e., assigning trial subjects to receive an intervention or placebo, based solely on the individual’s personal data, i.e., test results)

Based on the size of the flue selected, a preliminary damper size must be assumed. At this point in the design process, it is only necessary to decide if the damper throat area to be used will be equal to or twice the flue area. Once this decision has been made the Inlet Loss Coefficient, K 2, may be determined. If the damper throat area is equal to the flue area, K 2 is equal to 2.5. If the damper throat is twice the flue area, K 2 is equal to 1.0.

The goals of treatment are to “cure” the cancer, if possible; pro- long survival; and provide the highest possible quality of life during and after treatment. A cancer is cured when all traces of the cancer have been removed from the patient’s body. Although it is usually not possible to know if the cancer is completely eradicated, for many patients, the initial course of therapy is successful and the cancer never returns. However, some cancer- free survivors must cope with the long-term effects of treatment, as well as psychological concerns such as fear of recurrence. Cancer patients, caregivers, and survivors must have the infor- mation and support they need to play an active role in decisions that affect treatment and quality of life.

Effective immediately, hospitals shall notify an EMS provider if a patient transported to the hospital by that provider’s EMS crew subsequently tests positive for the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus. Notification must occur within 48 hours of the positive test result. This is a change from the previous 12-hour notification requirement. Notification of a positive test result is required regardless of whether CDC’s recommended use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during transport of any individual with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 was observed. Notification shall not include the name of the patient who tested positive.

• Fatigue and sleepiness. Feelings of fatigue (low energy, physical tiredness, weariness) are more common than symptoms of sleepiness (actual tendency to fall asleep) in patients with chronic insomnia. The presence of significant sleepiness should prompt a search for other potential sleep disorders. The number, duration, and timing of naps should be thoroughly investigated, as both a consequence of in- somnia and a potential contributing factor.

the top 10. We also extract and treat as binary features four different types of subjects from Altmetric and CrossRef: Medline subject codes for journal (Altmetric), subjects as indexed by SCOPUS (Altmetric), publisher subjects (Altmetric), and CrossRef subjects. Subjects are mostly at the granularity of the journal or higher. Similar journals have subjects in com- mon, with, for instance, the journals Nature Conservation, Conservation Biology, Ecology and Evolution, and many more sharing the CrossRef subject “nature and landscape conservation.”Multidisciplinaryjournals,suchasPNASand Nature, are often tagged with more general subjects such as “science” or “multidisciplinary.” Table 2 displays the top 10 CrossRef subjects describing at least 100 articles by aver- age news coverage. As expected, health related subjects top the list, along with those related to the environment. Unfor- tunately, but as expected, “general computer science” and “computational mathematics” secured the last places, at 0.5 and 0.3 news articles on average, respectively. We also extract textual features, when available, for each document: Title, Abstract, Press Release. For scientific ar- ticles with more than one press release, we randomly select one. For each type of text document, we preprocess using a standard English stop word list, extracting counts of un- igrams and bigrams, keeping tokens which appear in more than one document and no more than 80% of documents of the same type in the training set. We keep the 30,000 most frequently occurring features in the training set. We then scale the vectors of counts by tfidf weights fit on the training set. Finally, we create a boolean feature hasPR indicating whether the scientific article received coverage on one of the two prominent press release aggregation websites, Eu- rekAlert! or Science Daily. We hypothesize that mention on one of these would expose the scientific article to more jour- nalists and thus garner more coverage.

With some variation over time and across cancer types, care for the cancer population involves the six categories of services analyzed. The bars in Figures 2a-2c indicate that some patients had significant use of facility services in the year preceding the cancer diagnosis. For both colorectal and lung cancers, total spending on hospital inpatient increased as a percentage of total immediately following diagnosis. In all three cancers, the chemotherapy share of total spending increased rapidly in the first few months after diagnosis and, with the exception of breast cancer, continued at a fairly consistent level of around 20% of spending in subsequent years. Radiation therapy represented a small share of total spending except for breast cancer patients in the year following diagnosis.

Osteopathic medical schools also use differing cri- teria when selecting candidates to interview and/or extending offers of admission. For example, in the eval- uation of applicants, osteopathic medical schools place more emphasis on candidates’ interest in and knowledge of osteopathic philosophy. They also are more likely to seek out students who are interested in pursuing careers in primary care and in rural or underserved areas.3 Osteo- pathic admissions programs often view the candidate as a

The randomization, selection, and manipulation of access status for treatment articles were controlled entirely by the researcher, who was provided with direct access to the admin- istration of the journal websites. Authors and editors were not alerted as to which articles received the open access treat- ment. For some journals, treatment articles were indicated on the journal websites by an open lock icon.

Effective immediately, hospitals shall notify an EMS provider if a patient transported to the hospital by that provider’s EMS crew subsequently tests positive for the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus. Notification must occur within 48 hours of the positive test result. This is a change from the previous 12-hour notification requirement. Notification of a positive test result is required regardless of whether CDC’s recommended use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during transport of any individual with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 was observed. Notification shall not include the name of the patient who tested positive.

Insomnia occurs in individuals of all ages and races, and has been observed across all cultures and countries.8,9 The actual prevalence of insomnia varies according to the stringency of the definition used. Insomnia symptoms occur in approximately 33% to 50% of the adult population; insomnia symptoms with dis- tress or impairment (i.e., general insomnia disorder) in 10% to 15%; and specific insomnia disorders in 5% to 10%.10 Consis- tent risk factors for insomnia include increasing age, female sex, comorbid (medical, psychiatric, sleep, and substance use) disor- ders, shift work, and possibly unemployment and lower socio- economic status. Patients with comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions are at particularly increased risk, with psychiatric and chronic pain disorders having insomnia rates as high as 50% to 75%.11-13 The risk relationship between insomnia and psychiatric disorders appears to be bidirectional; several studies have also

Your child has been identified as needing services for English Language Learners (ELL). Your child will be placed in the ESL/Bilingual Education dual language immersion program, as outlined in the attached document. We believe that this program will help meet your child’s educational needs and enhance his/her academic success in school. Your child will be assessed twice yearly, or as needed, to determine progress toward individual ELL goals. When your child scores in the acceptable range (4.5 Literacy/5.0 Overall) on all areas of the W-APT or ACCESS assessment they will be exited from the program. If your student currently has an Individualized Education Program (IEP), their needs will continue to be met through their current accommodations.

The temperature change used for estimating thermal movements should be based on mean temperatures in the component. For solid masonry walls, tempera- tures at the center of the wall should be used. In cav- ity walls and veneers, the temperature at the center of each wythe or component should be used. In dis- continuous construction, the wythes will have different temperatures due to the separation of the wythes by an air space and perhaps insulation.

Wind turbines will be used to harness the kinetic energy of the moving air over the oceans on the OCS and convert it to electricity. Offshore winds are less turbulent (because the ocean is flat relative to onshore topography), and they tend to flow at higher speeds than onshore winds, thus allowing turbines to produce more electricity. Because the potential energy produced from the wind is directly proportional to the cube of the wind speed, increased wind speeds of only a few miles per hour can produce a significantly larger amount of electricity. For instance, a turbine at a site with an average wind speed of 16 mph would produce 50% more electricity than at a site with the same turbine and average wind speeds of 14 mph (Offshore Wind 2006).
Concrete masonry units are usually used for the interior wythe of a cavity wall in combination with a brick masonry exterior. They may also be used as accent bands in the exterior brick wythe. Hollow or solid concrete masonry units should conform to ASTM C 55 Specification for Concrete Building Brick, ASTM C 90 Specification for Loadbearing Concrete Masonry Units or ASTM C 129 Specification for Non-Loadbearing Concrete Masonry Units. Non load- bearing concrete masonry units are usually specified for the interior wythe when the brick and block cavity wall is used as infill walls for concrete or steel frame structural systems if shear loads are not transmitted to that wythe.

A patient’s decision to use an OON provider selection may be intentional or accidental. Reasons patients may incur OON costs include patient preference for a particular provider or specialty care center that may be out of network, the lack of network providers with appropriate specialists, and the lack of awareness or transparency about which providers are in the patient’s plan network. Common scenarios for accidental use of OON providers are emergency care or care from an OON provider working at an in-network hospital (e.g., radiologist, assistant surgeon, anesthesiologist).22 23 Figure 9 suggests that there might be significant financial consequences to the patient going out of network, which could be exacerbated if health plans remove popular cancer providers from their networks. Figure 9 also provides information on the relationship between the OON percentage (right vertical axis--relative to total spending) and total patient cost-sharing (left vertical axis). While most patients in our study reported under 10% of all OOP cost in the year of diagnosis is spent on out-of- network providers, those in the highest percentile of OOP spending incurred as much as 40% of those costs out-of-network.

Sport-specific rules may not allow adequate time for evaluation, and modifying these rules remains an area for improvement within the governing bodies of some sports. (C) When the sports medicine clinician becomes aware of a poten- tial injury, the athlete is approached and a brief history of the event is obtained from the athlete and those who witnessed the event or athlete behaviour. How the athlete responds to the elements of orientation, memory, concentration and balance is evaluated, as well as speech patterns and how the athlete appears to be processing information.

return-to-sport progression is individualised and is a function of the injury, the athlete’s age, prior SRC and level of play, and the ability to provide close supervision during the return to activity. The return-to-sport progression presented by the CISG is widely accepted but empiric, without evidence to support either the progression sequence or the time spent in each stage. In general, for young athletes, each stage of the progression should be at least 24 hours without return of symptoms before progressing to the next stage. (C)

Composite or combination flashings are typically less expensive than sheet metal and are easier to install. The most predominant type is a thin layer of metal sandwiched between one or two layers of another material. The metal layer is usually of aluminum, copper or lead. It is covered on one or both sides with various materials, such as asphalt coatings, kraft paper, fiberglass fabric or plastic films. Product literature should be reviewed to determine whether these materials are appropriate for use in brick masonry cavity walls. Consideration should be given to compatibility with adjacent sealants, delamination due to moisture penetration and movement of the wall system.
The randomization, selection, and manipulation of access status for treatment articles were controlled entirely by the researcher, who was provided with direct access to the admin- istration of the journal websites. Authors and editors were not alerted as to which articles received the open access treat- ment. For some journals, treatment articles were indicated on the journal websites by an open lock icon.

One can reasonably assert that this beneficial anxiolytic effect might have been enhanced even further under three study design conditions. First, if the inclusion criteria had required each patient to have a high anxiety score prior to the procedure, for instance a minimum of 7 points (with 10 as the maximum), there would have been a greater potential for a difference pre-treatment vs. during the procedure. The six responders had a baseline average of 6.3 points, so there was room for improvement. Of the six responders, two subjects had low baseline anxiety scores (i.e., patient F at 4 points and patient I at 2 points). A higher baseline inclusion parameter could have increased the differential prior to vs. during the EMG procedure. Second, there might not have been a sufficiently long waiting period between the drug administration and the procedure. One can reasonably assert that if the time interval between dosing and the procedure was increased to a minimum of 30 minutes or more (from the 10 – 20 minutes), the percentage of responders and the magnitude of the response could have been greater. However, it should be noted that often in a clinic time-is-of-the-essence between the patient’s initial assessment by the medical provider and the subsequent medical procedure. Some medical providers are willing to pre-treat an anxious patient, typically with an oral benzodiazepine either swallowed intact or pre-dissolved in water, and then have him/her wait (e.g., 30 + min.) for an anxiolytic effect to be acknowledged by the patient. But, some physicians and dentists might be under time constraints or might not be willing to oblige the patient this waiting period. This would not be an obstacle if either the drug has a rapid onset of effect or the patient were to pre-treat themselves immediately prior to arrival at the physician’s office, for instance 30-60 minutes in advance. Even under the conditions of this study that the authors consider might have been sub-optimal, this drug combo delivered by the oral mucosal route provided a rapid onset effect as a PRN medication. This anxiolytic benefit may be useful in treating anticipatory anxiety either in-office or prior to arrival. There is a third limitation to this study to consider. The compounded medicine contained 25 mg of atenolol and 0.2 mg of scopolamine HBr.

Participants also discovered that all RAS's can be separated in subsections or signposts, which can be arbitrary, but improve the structure of a RA. The recognized subsections were: research topic and definitions, research objectives (questions), methodological techniques, experimental set-up, object of the study (e.g. study area), main discoveries (analysed data), answers on research questions, explanation of the conclusions and further research and implications. The main RAS's are listed in a flow chart, showing main relations between different sections (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 shows the substructure of Introduction and Discussion RAS as the most important RAS's.

For the (2 vs. 2) SVM schema, one can observe from Table 6 that the highest overall accuracy is 0.91 and generated by a feature combination of POS-based unigrams and K-array semantics-based sequential features, regardless of whether WordNet is used to correct the POS of a unigram or not. In terms of the kernel functions, a linear kernel is used at the first level of the SVM model and a polynomial kernel at the second level. In addition, we notice that the inclusion of bigrams (the last four rows in Table 6) does not improve accuracy but rather reduce the accuracy. This agrees with results reported in previous studies. Tables 7 and 8 present the confusion matrices resulted from the two best feature sets using the (2 vs. 2) SVM schema. These two tables elaborate the two optimal feature sets as highlighted in Table 6. Results are obtained by using a linear and a polynomial kernel at the two levels respectively and averaged over 10-fold cross validation. Notice that in certain cases, the model cannot ditinguish between positive and neutral polarities due to the reasons discussed above; while negative and no-relationship can often be correctly identified.

The TSST method has been used to study the effects of oral propranolol in volunteer subjects [25-28]. The assessments of psychic anxiety can be assessed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) or other similar tools [29,30]. The somatic and psychic effects of oral propranolol were tested using the TSST method in healthy adult volunteers. Propranolol (40 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, reduced systolic blood pressure, and enhanced cognitive flexibility during stress. In another study propranolol (80 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, but paradoxically increased salivary cortisol, and did not significantly affect BP or subjective stress [25]. But, in another TSST study daily oral propranolol (80 mg) did not affect the salivary cortisol response [27].

What is the purpose of a RA and what makes it a good one, and who decides that it is a good RA? Are there rules for easier writing? If the main function of a RA is to transfer a new knowledge on a research topic, then a good paper is the one that is clear, coherent, focused, well argued and uses language that does not have ambiguous or equivoque meaning. However, it is not only the message that is important. The RA must have a well-defined structure and function in serve like a cook-book, so the others can reproduce and repeat explained experiments. Answer research questions Give summary conclusions There are some rules that can make the writing and publishing of RAs 'easier'. Here, we summarised some 'golden' rules that should always be in the mind of an inexperienced researcher (Table 3). We put all these together to make a final list of some 40 logical steps, which can be find in the Appendix.

Building on Failures Researchers continue on their search for effective new treatments for the more than 120 forms of brain cancer, but they face great challenges.93 Since 1998, there have only been 3 new drug approvals for brain cancer, while another 75 medicines have failed in the development process having been discontinued, suspended, or had no development reported.94 That is a 25:1 ratio of unsuccessful attempts to FDA-approved medicines. Decades of research have provided limited treatment options for patients facing aggressive, late-stage forms of brain cancer. Although challenges persist, researchers continue to use past setbacks to inform future discoveries in brain cancer therapies.
The inclusion of SPX Weeklys in the VIX Index calculation means that the near-term options will always have more than 23 days to expiration and the next-term options always have less than 37 days to expiration, so the resulting VIX Index value will always reflect an interpolation of σ2 1 and σ2 2 ; i.e., each individual weight is less than or equal to 1 and the sum of the weights equals 1.

Readership analysis was conducted on the 20 science journals in our data set (n(cid:1)2903). Articles published in the social sciences and humanities journals (n(cid:1)350) were omitted from the readership analysis, as many did not include abstract or full-text versions of their articles, and, in some cases, refer- ence views were added to full-text views, resulting in indeter- minate and incomparable results. Citation analyses were conducted on the entire article data set (n(cid:1)3245). A logistic regression model was used to estimate the likelihood of articles in each experimental group being cited within the first year after publication, controlling for journal and journal category effects.

De acordo com o Código Civil Brasileiro Art. 1.690, compete aos pais, e na falta de um deles ao outro, com exclusividade, representar os filhos menores de dezesseis anos, bem como assis�-los até a maioridade (com o falecimento dos pais, ou sendo estes julgados ausentes, ou em caso de os pais decaírem do poder familiar, compe�rá ao tutor legal representar o menor até os dezesseis anos e assis�-lo após essa idade - Código Civil Brasileiro Art. 1.747). Dessa maneira, no caso de um paciente menor, caso este seja menor de 16 anos, apenas o representante deverá assinar este termo (“representação”). Já, caso o paciente seja maior de 16 e menor de 18, tanto o representante legal, quanto o paciente, deverão assinar este termo (“assistência”).
Your child has been identified as needing services for English Language Learners (ELL). Your child will be placed in the ESL/Bilingual Education dual language immersion program, as outlined in the attached document. We believe that this program will help meet your child’s educational needs and enhance his/her academic success in school. Your child will be assessed twice yearly, or as needed, to determine progress toward individual ELL goals. When your child scores in the acceptable range (4.5 Literacy/5.0 Overall) on all areas of the W-APT or ACCESS assessment they will be exited from the program. If your student currently has an Individualized Education Program (IEP), their needs will continue to be met through their current accommodations.

When analyzing the data, we found that there does not exist a CUI de(cid:2)nition for a large number of pos- sible concepts. Table 5 shows the number of words in the CUI and ST de(cid:2)nitions for each concept in the NLM-WSD dataset. Only four target words have a CUI de(cid:2)nition for each possible concept. We also found the concept de(cid:2)nitions vary widely in length. The CUI de(cid:2)nitions in the UMLS come from a va- riety of sources and there may exist more than one de(cid:2)nition per source. Unlike CUI de(cid:2)nitions, there does exist an ST de(cid:2)nition for each possible con- cept. The ST de(cid:2)nitions come from the same source and are approximately the same length but they are a broad categorization. We believe this makes them too coarse grained to provide descriptive enough in- formation about their associated concepts.

President Obama has recently expressed a strong conviction that “Science offers great potential for improving health”. The President has announced a research initiative that aims to accelerate progress toward a new era of precision medicine. The time is accurate for this idealistic initiative, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other partners will work to attain this vision [7]. The concept of precision medicine speaks of prevention and treatment strategies that take individual variability into account. Even though it is not new, the impact of practicality is still deprived. If one considers blood typing, for instance, has been used to guide blood transfusions for more than a century. But the vision of applying this concept broadly has been intensely improved by the latest development of large-scale biologic databases (such as the human genome sequence), powerful methods for typifying patients (such as proteomics, metabolomics, genomics, diverse cellular assays, and even mobile health technology), and computational tools for analyzing large sets of data. Francis S.Collins et al. stated that, “What is necessary now is a broad
The prevailing models of emergency medical transport used in North America and Western Europe are quite costly and would be impractical for most low-income countries. Severe resource constraints, the poor condition of roads or trails, and a lack of fuel may dictate the utilization of a wider range of options. In the United Republic of Tanzania, for example, modes of emergency transportation include motor- boats, canoes, bicycles with trailers, tricycles with platforms, tractors with trailers, reconditioned vehicles, and ox carts (22).

While many of these symptoms can be seen with other conditions such as allergies, we ask that you seek medical evaluation if you identify any of these symptoms. Loss of taste or smell is very specific to COVID‐19 and may be described as food tasting bland, rather than not being able to taste. If your child develops any of these symptoms, please notify your child’s school, contact your child’s doctor for evaluation/testing, and keep your child home from school.

Participants agreed that some RA, even with good data and interesting results, will be rejected if the style and format of the paper are not tailored for the audience. This agrees with the results of investigations among 116 editors (Gosden, 1992; Fig. 1), who identified following most frequent causes to reject an L2 author: unclear text, incoherent development of the topic in paragraphs and incorrect use of grammar. In addition, the participants analysed an exemplary flawed paper by unknown author and decided to reject it after some discussion. The list of reasons for rejection can be seen in Table 1.

samples)) / (geometric mean cpm of no drug samples). Percentage reductions are used to plot percentage inhibition of growth as a function of drug concentrations. IC 50 values are determined by linear regression analyses on the linear segments of the curves (IC 90 values can also be determined by curve-fitting and can provide an useful measure of variation between experiments). Assays are typically repeated on two or three separate occasions. Within each experiment, standard deviations are typically less than 10% of the mean. Differences in parasite stages of development can lead to up to two-fold shifts in the IC 50 values between experiments; however, these differences rarely affect the overall relationships between the parasite lines in terms of their differences in drug response 4-11 .

The goals of treatment are to “cure” the cancer, if possible; pro- long survival; and provide the highest possible quality of life during and after treatment. A cancer is cured when all traces of the cancer have been removed from the patient’s body. Although it is usually not possible to know if the cancer is completely eradicated, for many patients, the initial course of therapy is successful and the cancer never returns. However, some cancer- free survivors must cope with the long-term effects of treatment, as well as psychological concerns such as fear of recurrence. Cancer patients, caregivers, and survivors must have the infor- mation and support they need to play an active role in decisions that affect treatment and quality of life.

In summary, public and non-profit-making sectors, and by extension tax-payers and philanthropists, have provided considerable financial and non-financial contributions towards the R&amp;D of cancer medicines. This means that in many cases, pharmaceutical companies have not incurred the full costs of R&amp;D. The pharmaceutical industry has also benefited greatly from the knowledge generated by public-sector investments in R&amp;D, and by having access to research supported by public funding at costs, if any, lower than the market value.

One can reasonably assert that this beneficial anxiolytic effect might have been enhanced even further under three study design conditions. First, if the inclusion criteria had required each patient to have a high anxiety score prior to the procedure, for instance a minimum of 7 points (with 10 as the maximum), there would have been a greater potential for a difference pre-treatment vs. during the procedure. The six responders had a baseline average of 6.3 points, so there was room for improvement. Of the six responders, two subjects had low baseline anxiety scores (i.e., patient F at 4 points and patient I at 2 points). A higher baseline inclusion parameter could have increased the differential prior to vs. during the EMG procedure. Second, there might not have been a sufficiently long waiting period between the drug administration and the procedure. One can reasonably assert that if the time interval between dosing and the procedure was increased to a minimum of 30 minutes or more (from the 10 – 20 minutes), the percentage of responders and the magnitude of the response could have been greater. However, it should be noted that often in a clinic time-is-of-the-essence between the patient’s initial assessment by the medical provider and the subsequent medical procedure. Some medical providers are willing to pre-treat an anxious patient, typically with an oral benzodiazepine either swallowed intact or pre-dissolved in water, and then have him/her wait (e.g., 30 + min.) for an anxiolytic effect to be acknowledged by the patient. But, some physicians and dentists might be under time constraints or might not be willing to oblige the patient this waiting period. This would not be an obstacle if either the drug has a rapid onset of effect or the patient were to pre-treat themselves immediately prior to arrival at the physician’s office, for instance 30-60 minutes in advance. Even under the conditions of this study that the authors consider might have been sub-optimal, this drug combo delivered by the oral mucosal route provided a rapid onset effect as a PRN medication. This anxiolytic benefit may be useful in treating anticipatory anxiety either in-office or prior to arrival. There is a third limitation to this study to consider. The compounded medicine contained 25 mg of atenolol and 0.2 mg of scopolamine HBr.

Building on Failures Researchers continue on their search for effective new treatments for the more than 120 forms of brain cancer, but they face great challenges.93 Since 1998, there have only been 3 new drug approvals for brain cancer, while another 75 medicines have failed in the development process having been discontinued, suspended, or had no development reported.94 That is a 25:1 ratio of unsuccessful attempts to FDA-approved medicines. Decades of research have provided limited treatment options for patients facing aggressive, late-stage forms of brain cancer. Although challenges persist, researchers continue to use past setbacks to inform future discoveries in brain cancer therapies.

What is the purpose of a RA and what makes it a good one, and who decides that it is a good RA? Are there rules for easier writing? If the main function of a RA is to transfer a new knowledge on a research topic, then a good paper is the one that is clear, coherent, focused, well argued and uses language that does not have ambiguous or equivoque meaning. However, it is not only the message that is important. The RA must have a well-defined structure and function in serve like a cook-book, so the others can reproduce and repeat explained experiments. Answer research questions Give summary conclusions There are some rules that can make the writing and publishing of RAs 'easier'. Here, we summarised some 'golden' rules that should always be in the mind of an inexperienced researcher (Table 3). We put all these together to make a final list of some 40 logical steps, which can be find in the Appendix.

Dose ranging test: Here, compounds are tested at a minimum of 4 different doses (the “dose ranging, full 4-day test”, typically 100, 30, 10 and 3 mg/kg, by both s.c. and p.o. routes of administration). ED 50 and ED 90 values are calculated by plotting the log dose against probit activity (for example, using Microcal “Origin”). These reflect the drug concentrations at which 50% and 90% of suppression of parasitemia is achieved. Note that with short half-life drugs it may be necessary to dose multiple times per day. Two other parameters measured in this study are relative potency compared to an appropriate standard drug, and oral bioavailability (assessed by comparison of oral and parenteral administration).

The randomization, selection, and manipulation of access status for treatment articles were controlled entirely by the researcher, who was provided with direct access to the admin- istration of the journal websites. Authors and editors were not alerted as to which articles received the open access treat- ment. For some journals, treatment articles were indicated on the journal websites by an open lock icon.
A patient’s decision to use an OON provider selection may be intentional or accidental. Reasons patients may incur OON costs include patient preference for a particular provider or specialty care center that may be out of network, the lack of network providers with appropriate specialists, and the lack of awareness or transparency about which providers are in the patient’s plan network. Common scenarios for accidental use of OON providers are emergency care or care from an OON provider working at an in-network hospital (e.g., radiologist, assistant surgeon, anesthesiologist).22 23 Figure 9 suggests that there might be significant financial consequences to the patient going out of network, which could be exacerbated if health plans remove popular cancer providers from their networks. Figure 9 also provides information on the relationship between the OON percentage (right vertical axis--relative to total spending) and total patient cost-sharing (left vertical axis). While most patients in our study reported under 10% of all OOP cost in the year of diagnosis is spent on out-of- network providers, those in the highest percentile of OOP spending incurred as much as 40% of those costs out-of-network.
The naïve interpretation of this is that no more than 13 candidate compounds would be needed for a reasonable chance of launching one new medicine, and 25 for a com- bination with two NCEs (new chemical entities). How- ever, if one aims for a 90% overall chance of success (P), the number of candidates n, each with a success probabil- ity s (8%) is described by the negative binomial distribu- tion in Eq. 1.
Your child has been identified as needing services for English Language Learners (ELL). Your child will be placed in the ESL/Bilingual Education dual language immersion program, as outlined in the attached document. We believe that this program will help meet your child’s educational needs and enhance his/her academic success in school. Your child will be assessed twice yearly, or as needed, to determine progress toward individual ELL goals. When your child scores in the acceptable range (4.5 Literacy/5.0 Overall) on all areas of the W-APT or ACCESS assessment they will be exited from the program. If your student currently has an Individualized Education Program (IEP), their needs will continue to be met through their current accommodations.

Medical misdiagnosis, in the form of inaccurate, late, and delayed diagnoses, is an ongoing problem in the U.S. Not only do these diagnostic errors present an ongoing risk to the health and safety of patients, but they also cost the economy billions of dollars.

□ Alternative Program (Alt): Transitional Bilingual Education: Students with an approved Parental Exception Waiver* receive core instruction initially through their primary language and instruction in ELD from trained and authorized teachers using district-adopted textbooks and supplementary instructional materials. Instruction is based on ELD and grade-level standards. With the goal of English Proficiency, in addition to mastery of core content, the language in which academic subjects are taught gradually shifts from students’ first language to English in order to make academic progress and meet the requirements to be reclassified as fluent English proficient (FEP). Parents may request specific program details for the alternative program at each school site.

Wind turbines will be used to harness the kinetic energy of the moving air over the oceans on the OCS and convert it to electricity. Offshore winds are less turbulent (because the ocean is flat relative to onshore topography), and they tend to flow at higher speeds than onshore winds, thus allowing turbines to produce more electricity. Because the potential energy produced from the wind is directly proportional to the cube of the wind speed, increased wind speeds of only a few miles per hour can produce a significantly larger amount of electricity. For instance, a turbine at a site with an average wind speed of 16 mph would produce 50% more electricity than at a site with the same turbine and average wind speeds of 14 mph (Offshore Wind 2006).

Phase 1. The aim of Phase 1 was to identify the contributions of clinical and laboratory variables that in practice were the most predictive of the decision to initiate DMARD therapy in a population of patients with early undifferentiated synovitis. Initiation of DMARD therapy was used as an indicator of the physician’s opinion that the patient was at risk of developing persistent and/or erosive arthritis that we would currently consider to be RA. Data on 3,115 patients from 9 early arthritis cohorts who were consid- ered not to have evidence of another possible diagnosis explaining their presentation were obtained. Between July 2007 and November 2008 an expert working group developed an analysis strategy that related an agreed- upon list of standardized clinical and laboratory vari- ables collected at baseline to the initiation of DMARD treatment within the next 12 months. MTX initiation was used as the gold standard for this purpose. The analytical process aimed to identify the independent contribution of each variable on this list and included univariate regression modeling, a subsequent principal components analysis, and a multivariate regression model that included all identified components (25). The resulting list of informative variables identified during that process and the weights based on the odds ratios are shown in Table 1. Phase 2. Phase 2 consisted of a consensus-based, decision science–informed approach, which took place between November 2008 and June 2009. The purpose of this phase was to derive a clinician-based judgment on

The analysis found that low-income countries could spend on average up to US$ 3800 per cancer patient annually on cancer medicines for all newly-diagnosed cancer patients, and the total expenditure on these medicines would be within the generously assumed 5% of the total health expenditure (Table 4.2). In high- income countries, the analysis found that a budget threshold of 5% of the total health expenditure would allow a spending of up to US$ 40 600 on cancer medicines per patient per year, with a view to providing universal coverage.

Based on the size of the flue selected, a preliminary damper size must be assumed. At this point in the design process, it is only necessary to decide if the damper throat area to be used will be equal to or twice the flue area. Once this decision has been made the Inlet Loss Coefficient, K 2, may be determined. If the damper throat area is equal to the flue area, K 2 is equal to 2.5. If the damper throat is twice the flue area, K 2 is equal to 1.0.

In summary, public and non-profit-making sectors, and by extension tax-payers and philanthropists, have provided considerable financial and non-financial contributions towards the R&amp;D of cancer medicines. This means that in many cases, pharmaceutical companies have not incurred the full costs of R&amp;D. The pharmaceutical industry has also benefited greatly from the knowledge generated by public-sector investments in R&amp;D, and by having access to research supported by public funding at costs, if any, lower than the market value.
a) The regulation gives data subjects the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, where there is a legal or similarly significant effect on the person (the regulation prohibits automated processing where there is no meaningful human involvement in the decision and where the decision either impacts one’s legal rights, or the decision has the potential to significantly influence the circumstances, behavior, or choices of the individuals concerned). b) Other considerations: i) Research affecting the healthcare a person receives, where there is no human involvement in the decision, would be considered covered under the regulation (i.e., assigning trial subjects to receive an intervention or placebo, based solely on the individual’s personal data, i.e., test results)

These assignment guidelines pertain exclusively to Commercial Mobile Radio Service providers (CMRS). The IMSI Administrator directly administers only the Home Network Identity (HNI) segment of the resource. The HNI uniquely identifies the home wireless network of a FCC- licensed two-way CMRS subscriber and contains the Mobile Country Code (MCC) and the Mobile Network Code (MNC). The remaining segment of the IMSI, the Mobile Station Identification Number (MSIN), is directly administered by the wireless network licensee to which the HNI is assigned. Issue: In 1998, ITU Recommendation E.212 was modified allowing IMSI assignments to those Wireline Service Providers offering limited mobility services. As a result, HNI assignments are no longer available exclusively to CMRS providers. The current IMSI assignment and administrative guidelines do not however reflect these modifications.

The use of two antimalarials simultaneously, especially when the antimalarials have different mechanisms of action, has the potential for inhib- iting the development of resistance to either of the components. The efficacy of a combination of a 4-aminoquinoline drug (either chloroquine or amo- diaquine) with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine has been reviewed (43). The results of this review sug- gested that the addition of either chloroquine or amodiaquine to SP marginally improved parasitological clearance (compared with SP alone). The studies reviewed were mostly done in areas and at times when both SP and chloroquine/amodi- aquine retained a fair amount of efficacy, and it is not clear from these studies how well such a combination would act in areas where one of the components was significantly compromised. Additionally, to date, there are no data to suggest whether this slightly improved clearance would

medically related text and metadata features, such as “pa- tients,” “alzheimer,” “health information management,” and “medicine” are also important and of mostly positive polar- ity, since medical articles attract greater news coverage than, say, a recently published computer science paper. As we dis- cuss later, the presence of “alzheimer” as an important, neg- ative feature is more an artifact of the dataset than an iden- tification of trends in popularity. We also find an artifact of year (2016) of the dataset with the feature “zika virus,” due to the 2015-2016 zika epidemic in North and South Amer- ica.

Properties of insulation materials vary widely. Table 3 shows various properties of insulation materials used in brick masonry cavity walls. The thermal conductivity (k) and thermal resistance (R) provide a means of comparing the insulating properties of insulation materials. These are determined in accordance with ASTM C 177 Test Method for Steady-State Heat Flux Measurements and Thermal Transmission Properties by Means of the Guarded-Hot-Plate Apparatus measured at various temperatures. Due to the large number of types of insulation, and even larger number of manufacturers, Table 3 lists only a few representative values of physical properties. For some materials, an aged or stabilized value is given. In all cases, the aged or stabilized value is the one that should be used in design. Individual manufacturers should be consulted for design values and other properties of their specific materials and their applications.

As reflected in the statutory new drug and new animal drug approval standards in sections 505 109 and 512 of the FD&amp;C Act and the standard for licensure under section 351 of the PHS Act, the 110 evidence that is the basis for the risk assessment of a drug differs from the evidence that is the 111 basis for an effectiveness determination. The effectiveness determination is generally intended 112 to evaluate a drug’s positive effect based on adequate and well-controlled trials designed to 113 evaluate a specific efficacy variable (or a discrete number of efficacy variables) for the purpose 114 of distinguishing the effect of the drug from other influences.11 In contrast, FDA’s premarket 115 risk assessment is intended to identify and characterize the nature, frequency, and severity of the 116 usually broad spectrum of adverse events and other risks associated with the use of a product 117 based on a range of data sources. For human drugs, the supporting data are generally not derived 118 from studies designed to test a specific safety hypothesis. The assessment is based largely on 119 observations of adverse events from studies intended to assess effectiveness and includes all 120 patients exposed to the investigational drug during its development. For animal drugs, there are 121 generally data from safety studies in the target animal, in addition to observations of adverse 122 events from studies intended to assess effectiveness.12 For both human and animal drugs, 123 relevant data are weighted and integrated, based on the nature and reliability of the data sources, 124 into a coherent assessment of what adverse reactions are reasonably associated with the use of a 125 product and, to the extent possible, their frequency and severity.13 126

Insomnia occurs in individuals of all ages and races, and has been observed across all cultures and countries.8,9 The actual prevalence of insomnia varies according to the stringency of the definition used. Insomnia symptoms occur in approximately 33% to 50% of the adult population; insomnia symptoms with dis- tress or impairment (i.e., general insomnia disorder) in 10% to 15%; and specific insomnia disorders in 5% to 10%.10 Consis- tent risk factors for insomnia include increasing age, female sex, comorbid (medical, psychiatric, sleep, and substance use) disor- ders, shift work, and possibly unemployment and lower socio- economic status. Patients with comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions are at particularly increased risk, with psychiatric and chronic pain disorders having insomnia rates as high as 50% to 75%.11-13 The risk relationship between insomnia and psychiatric disorders appears to be bidirectional; several studies have also

Participants agreed that some RA, even with good data and interesting results, will be rejected if the style and format of the paper are not tailored for the audience. This agrees with the results of investigations among 116 editors (Gosden, 1992; Fig. 1), who identified following most frequent causes to reject an L2 author: unclear text, incoherent development of the topic in paragraphs and incorrect use of grammar. In addition, the participants analysed an exemplary flawed paper by unknown author and decided to reject it after some discussion. The list of reasons for rejection can be seen in Table 1.

Concrete masonry units are usually used for the interior wythe of a cavity wall in combination with a brick masonry exterior. They may also be used as accent bands in the exterior brick wythe. Hollow or solid concrete masonry units should conform to ASTM C 55 Specification for Concrete Building Brick, ASTM C 90 Specification for Loadbearing Concrete Masonry Units or ASTM C 129 Specification for Non-Loadbearing Concrete Masonry Units. Non load- bearing concrete masonry units are usually specified for the interior wythe when the brick and block cavity wall is used as infill walls for concrete or steel frame structural systems if shear loads are not transmitted to that wythe.

In the late 1800s, Andrew Taylor Still identified the neuromusculoskeletal system as the key element in health maintenance and stressed preventive aspects of medi- cine in place of drug therapy. During that time, osteop- athy was truly separate and distinct from the world of allo- pathic medicine. Since then, as medicine in general has become more evidence-based and supported by research, osteopathic philosophy has evolved into a more complete and robust osteopathic medicine. The phrase “osteopathic medicine” is now the accepted term for the profession over “osteopathy,” a now-antiquated term that represents a period when Still championed a near-drugless form of manual medicine. Since its conception, osteopathic med- icine has adapted its body of knowledge to incorporate contemporary scientific thought, including germ theory, pharmacology, and other “allopathic” teachings. The cen- tral tenets of osteopathic thought, however, have been maintained and continue to guide DOs in their practice of medicine. Though interprofessional relations between MDs and DOs are better than they have ever been before, challenges still exist in terms of keeping the osteopathic tradition intact, improving the evidence basis of OMM via clinical research, and advocating for widespread recogni- tion of DOs.

Profit control is an effective measure to manage medicine prices insofar as the regulators have control over the supply of medicines at certain points along the supply chain. Typically, this means that the regulator needs to have full visibility of the supply and distribution chains. The regulator also needs to have the capacity and ability to enforce non-compliance. Profit control is most effective when there is a publicly- funded universal programme for the provision of medicines. In contrast, it may be much less effective in health care settings where the private sector plays a significant role in the delivery of medicines, or where the structure of supply chain is complex or under-developed (183).

In addition to return to learning and sporting environments, older athletes may need to return to driving, where subtle defi- cits could compromise safety. Most sports medicine physicians do not counsel athletes with SRC about driving.90 Driving is a complex process involving coordination of cognitive, visual and motor skills, as well as concentration, attention, visual percep- tion, insight and memory, which can all be affected by SRC.90 Little is known about the risk of driving after SRC, but prelim- inary data suggest some impairment exists when patients with concussion report they are asymptomatic.91 Currently, no widely

Parasitemia is determined microscopically by counting 4 fields of approximately 100 erythrocytes per field. For low parasitemias (&lt;1%), up to 4000 erythrocytes have to be counted. Alternatively the parasitemia can also be determined by FACS analysis, which works particularly well for parasitemias &gt;1%. The difference between the mean value of the control group (taken as 100%) and those of the experimental groups is calculated and expressed as percent reduction (= activity) using the following equation:

There are debates about whether the returns generated from the sales of medicines, including cancer medicines, are sufficient for pharmaceutical companies to cover their past R&amp;D expenses, maintain their operations and engage in future drug discovery research. For example, some commentators have observed that the revenue generated from the sales of imatinib had exceeded the costs of R&amp;D within two years and “the revenues over the subsequent years of the patent would represent generous profits to the company” (30). Another study found that total revenue from the sales of 10 cancer medicines since approval over a median of four years (US$ 67.0 billion) was 9.3 times the total R&amp;D spending of US$ 7.2 billion (or 7.4 times using an estimated risk-adjusted R&amp;D costs of US$ 9.1 billion) (94).

Building on Failures Researchers continue on their search for effective new treatments for the more than 120 forms of brain cancer, but they face great challenges.93 Since 1998, there have only been 3 new drug approvals for brain cancer, while another 75 medicines have failed in the development process having been discontinued, suspended, or had no development reported.94 That is a 25:1 ratio of unsuccessful attempts to FDA-approved medicines. Decades of research have provided limited treatment options for patients facing aggressive, late-stage forms of brain cancer. Although challenges persist, researchers continue to use past setbacks to inform future discoveries in brain cancer therapies.

The use of two antimalarials simultaneously, especially when the antimalarials have different mechanisms of action, has the potential for inhib- iting the development of resistance to either of the components. The efficacy of a combination of a 4-aminoquinoline drug (either chloroquine or amo- diaquine) with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine has been reviewed (43). The results of this review sug- gested that the addition of either chloroquine or amodiaquine to SP marginally improved parasitological clearance (compared with SP alone). The studies reviewed were mostly done in areas and at times when both SP and chloroquine/amodi- aquine retained a fair amount of efficacy, and it is not clear from these studies how well such a combination would act in areas where one of the components was significantly compromised. Additionally, to date, there are no data to suggest whether this slightly improved clearance would

of the weakest links in the system. A study in Malawi revealed that the condition of many seriously ill children arriving at clinicshadnotpreviouslybeenrecognized.Insteadofreceiving immediate emergency care they were kept waiting for long periods before being given proper treatment. This resulted in avoidable deaths and disability (28). In Mexico, verbal autopsies of 132 children who died revealed that the majority had been seen by a physician within three days of death. Poor selection of medications and late referral to tertiary care were judged to be important contributory factors in more than half the deaths (29). A qualitative study of 21 hospitals in seven developing countries found that poor triage of incoming patients and inadequate provision of emergency care jeopar- dized the lives of arriving patients (30). Fourteen of the facilities (including 10 of 13 district hospitals) did not have an adequate triage system. A comprehensive review of the management of 131 children treated at these facilities found evidenceofinappropriateordelayedtriagein8%ofcases,poor clinical assessments in 41%, and potentially harmful delays in treatment in 19%. Several international health projects aimed at improving initial triage and treatment have been instituted at district health care facilities. Most focus on the strengthening of maternal and child health. One such project produced guidelines for emergency triage and treatment (28). An evaluation of these guidelines demonstrated that they significantly decreased the time required to assess children in need of urgent medical attention (31). In Sierra Leone a health care facility was upgraded in order to enhance its ability to provide prompt medical and surgicaltreatmenttowomenwithcomplicationsofpregnancy. The annual number of obstetric procedures rose from 2 to 38 over a period of five years. During the same period the

In summary, public and non-profit-making sectors, and by extension tax-payers and philanthropists, have provided considerable financial and non-financial contributions towards the R&amp;D of cancer medicines. This means that in many cases, pharmaceutical companies have not incurred the full costs of R&amp;D. The pharmaceutical industry has also benefited greatly from the knowledge generated by public-sector investments in R&amp;D, and by having access to research supported by public funding at costs, if any, lower than the market value.

AASM practice parameter papers are based on evidence- based review and grading of literature, often addressing a spe- cific issue or topic. Clinical guidelines provide clinicians with a working overview for disease or disorder evaluation and man- agement. These guidelines include practice parameter papers and also include areas with limited evidence in order to provide a comprehensive practice guideline. Both practice parameters and clinical guidelines define principles of practice that should meet the needs of most patients. They should not, however, be considered exhaustive, inclusive of all available methods of care, or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably expected to obtain the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding appropriateness of any specific therapy must be made by the clinician and patient in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible

For the (2 vs. 2) SVM schema, one can observe from Table 6 that the highest overall accuracy is 0.91 and generated by a feature combination of POS-based unigrams and K-array semantics-based sequential features, regardless of whether WordNet is used to correct the POS of a unigram or not. In terms of the kernel functions, a linear kernel is used at the first level of the SVM model and a polynomial kernel at the second level. In addition, we notice that the inclusion of bigrams (the last four rows in Table 6) does not improve accuracy but rather reduce the accuracy. This agrees with results reported in previous studies. Tables 7 and 8 present the confusion matrices resulted from the two best feature sets using the (2 vs. 2) SVM schema. These two tables elaborate the two optimal feature sets as highlighted in Table 6. Results are obtained by using a linear and a polynomial kernel at the two levels respectively and averaged over 10-fold cross validation. Notice that in certain cases, the model cannot ditinguish between positive and neutral polarities due to the reasons discussed above; while negative and no-relationship can often be correctly identified.

Dose ranging test: Here, compounds are tested at a minimum of 4 different doses (the “dose ranging, full 4-day test”, typically 100, 30, 10 and 3 mg/kg, by both s.c. and p.o. routes of administration). ED 50 and ED 90 values are calculated by plotting the log dose against probit activity (for example, using Microcal “Origin”). These reflect the drug concentrations at which 50% and 90% of suppression of parasitemia is achieved. Note that with short half-life drugs it may be necessary to dose multiple times per day. Two other parameters measured in this study are relative potency compared to an appropriate standard drug, and oral bioavailability (assessed by comparison of oral and parenteral administration).

somnolence as a side effect is reproducible in susceptible individuals (White and Rumbold 1988). Sedation is a com- mon side effect of the traditional antipsychotics, with chlorpromazine and thioridazine somewhat more sedating than haloperidol. Clinical studies have shown a high inci- dence of persistent sedation with clozapine (46%) with less frequent reports of sedation with risperidone, olanzapine, sertindole and quetiapine (Monti et al. 2016). The sed- ation associated with these agents is most likely associated with their known effects on histaminic receptors. Doxepin, a sedating psychotropic agent with pro- nounced histamine (H-1) receptor antagonism exerts at least part of its effects by antagonizing orexin (Krystal et al. 2013). Suvorexant, is an orexin antagonist designed to lower waking arousal (Norman and Anderson 2016). Currently, it is being heavily marketed as a hypnotic (Rhyne and Anderson 2015). As based on performance and driving tests, this agent is known to produce a dose-related next day increase in somnolence for all age groupings tested (Farkus 2013). Sedative drug effects on daytime sleepiness are summarized in Table 4.

of the weakest links in the system. A study in Malawi revealed that the condition of many seriously ill children arriving at clinicshadnotpreviouslybeenrecognized.Insteadofreceiving immediate emergency care they were kept waiting for long periods before being given proper treatment. This resulted in avoidable deaths and disability (28). In Mexico, verbal autopsies of 132 children who died revealed that the majority had been seen by a physician within three days of death. Poor selection of medications and late referral to tertiary care were judged to be important contributory factors in more than half the deaths (29). A qualitative study of 21 hospitals in seven developing countries found that poor triage of incoming patients and inadequate provision of emergency care jeopar- dized the lives of arriving patients (30). Fourteen of the facilities (including 10 of 13 district hospitals) did not have an adequate triage system. A comprehensive review of the management of 131 children treated at these facilities found evidenceofinappropriateordelayedtriagein8%ofcases,poor clinical assessments in 41%, and potentially harmful delays in treatment in 19%. Several international health projects aimed at improving initial triage and treatment have been instituted at district health care facilities. Most focus on the strengthening of maternal and child health. One such project produced guidelines for emergency triage and treatment (28). An evaluation of these guidelines demonstrated that they significantly decreased the time required to assess children in need of urgent medical attention (31). In Sierra Leone a health care facility was upgraded in order to enhance its ability to provide prompt medical and surgicaltreatmenttowomenwithcomplicationsofpregnancy. The annual number of obstetric procedures rose from 2 to 38 over a period of five years. During the same period the

Participants agreed that some RA, even with good data and interesting results, will be rejected if the style and format of the paper are not tailored for the audience. This agrees with the results of investigations among 116 editors (Gosden, 1992; Fig. 1), who identified following most frequent causes to reject an L2 author: unclear text, incoherent development of the topic in paragraphs and incorrect use of grammar. In addition, the participants analysed an exemplary flawed paper by unknown author and decided to reject it after some discussion. The list of reasons for rejection can be seen in Table 1.

We report the results for four experiments in this pa- per: i) the results of using the IDF stoplist over a ba- sic stoplist, ii) the results of our approach using dif- ferent context descriptions of the possible concepts of a target word, iii) the results of our approach com- pared to SenseClusters and Humphrey et al. (2006) using the NLM-WSD dataset, and iv) the results of our approach compared to SenseClusters using the con(cid:3)ated dataset. The results of using an individualized IDF stoplist for each target word show an improvement over us- ing the basic stoplist. The results of our approach using different context descriptions show that for the NLM-WSD dataset the large differences in accuracy makes it unclear which of the context descriptions performed the best. On the con(cid:3)ated dataset, adding the ST de(cid:2)nition to the context description improved

of care data [ 12 ] . The NCI estimate for expenditure on prostate cancer treatment in 2006 was $9.862 billion, and average Medicare payments per patient in the fi rst year after diagnosis were $11 000. It should be noted when interpreting this data that use of PSA testing for prostate cancer is more widespread in the USA than in many other countries, thus increasing the number of cases identifi ed. In addition, Medicare did not cover certain cancer care expenses such as oral medicines, commonly used to treat prostate cancer until January 2006. These out-of-pocket costs may comprise 10% of the $11 000 estimate. Direct medical expenditures are only one part of the total economic burden of cancer, as cancer- related illnesses and death lead to losses in economic productivity.

somnolence as a side effect is reproducible in susceptible individuals (White and Rumbold 1988). Sedation is a com- mon side effect of the traditional antipsychotics, with chlorpromazine and thioridazine somewhat more sedating than haloperidol. Clinical studies have shown a high inci- dence of persistent sedation with clozapine (46%) with less frequent reports of sedation with risperidone, olanzapine, sertindole and quetiapine (Monti et al. 2016). The sed- ation associated with these agents is most likely associated with their known effects on histaminic receptors. Doxepin, a sedating psychotropic agent with pro- nounced histamine (H-1) receptor antagonism exerts at least part of its effects by antagonizing orexin (Krystal et al. 2013). Suvorexant, is an orexin antagonist designed to lower waking arousal (Norman and Anderson 2016). Currently, it is being heavily marketed as a hypnotic (Rhyne and Anderson 2015). As based on performance and driving tests, this agent is known to produce a dose-related next day increase in somnolence for all age groupings tested (Farkus 2013). Sedative drug effects on daytime sleepiness are summarized in Table 4.

Dose ranging test: Here, compounds are tested at a minimum of 4 different doses (the “dose ranging, full 4-day test”, typically 100, 30, 10 and 3 mg/kg, by both s.c. and p.o. routes of administration). ED 50 and ED 90 values are calculated by plotting the log dose against probit activity (for example, using Microcal “Origin”). These reflect the drug concentrations at which 50% and 90% of suppression of parasitemia is achieved. Note that with short half-life drugs it may be necessary to dose multiple times per day. Two other parameters measured in this study are relative potency compared to an appropriate standard drug, and oral bioavailability (assessed by comparison of oral and parenteral administration). However,

Results from the tests showed that the average value of critical thinking ability to the average achievement after the testing ended, showed the relationship was statistically significant (.05). As a result, the researchers compared the results of Table 4 and determined that after the posttest, data showed the average of critical thinking ability and post-learning achievement were higher than before the study.

samples)) / (geometric mean cpm of no drug samples). Percentage reductions are used to plot percentage inhibition of growth as a function of drug concentrations. IC 50 values are determined by linear regression analyses on the linear segments of the curves (IC 90 values can also be determined by curve-fitting and can provide an useful measure of variation between experiments). Assays are typically repeated on two or three separate occasions. Within each experiment, standard deviations are typically less than 10% of the mean. Differences in parasite stages of development can lead to up to two-fold shifts in the IC 50 values between experiments; however, these differences rarely affect the overall relationships between the parasite lines in terms of their differences in drug response 4-11 .

medicine when following up n candidate molecules. The numerical solutions for this equation show that at least 48 molecules are to be evaluated for this probability to exceed 90%. The MMV discovery portfolio was built and funded to deliver two new preclinical candidates per year, and allowing for a third molecule coming from else- where, then this would still require some 16 years’ invest- ment per combination, except if there is a considerable increase in success rates going forwards (and a justifica- tion for this), or significantly increased investment. The hope on the horizon is that many of the new molecules are first-in-class, and so should they fail in clinical devel- opment there will be scope for well-defined back-up pro- jects, and these are normally much more cost-effective programmes. The definition of new molecular targets also opens up new possibilities for engaging the wider research community, allowing access to resources such as the EU’s European Lead Factory, which considers molec- ular targets but not phenotypic approaches.

In the absence of financial support from governments, the treatment costs presented in Table 4.3 would not be affordable to individual patients. For example, a course of standard (adjuvant) treatment for early stage HER2 positive breast cancer (Adjuvant AC-TH) would cost about 10 years of average annual wages in India and South Africa, and 1.7 years in the USAxx. Patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in India, South Africa and the USA would require, respectively, 3.7 years, 5.6 years and 1.1 years of wages to cover for the costs of a

The naïve interpretation of this is that no more than 13 candidate compounds would be needed for a reasonable chance of launching one new medicine, and 25 for a com- bination with two NCEs (new chemical entities). How- ever, if one aims for a 90% overall chance of success (P), the number of candidates n, each with a success probabil- ity s (8%) is described by the negative binomial distribu- tion in Eq. 1.

Many complicated and expensive techniques have been applied extensively in literature to extract relationships and dependencies from data. These techniques generally rely on a deep parse results that gives a rich representation which is used for applications in knowledge extraction and semantics. The problem with biomedical data parsing is that there is no exhaustive tagged training corpus available to build models for efficient parsing on test data. Also, deep parsing is computationally very expensive compared to shallow parsing that uses the finite state automaton techniques. UMLS graciously provides such a shallow parser[7] that is trained on entire Medline corpus and claims to achieve over 97% accuracy.

Canada has a national stopgap to protect consumers from price gouging. The Patient Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB), a consumer protection agency, has the authority to impose sanctions and price reductions for patented products deemed excessively priced. However, the PMPRB is hobbled in its ability to keep Canada’s drug spending low.

Based on the size of the flue selected, a preliminary damper size must be assumed. At this point in the design process, it is only necessary to decide if the damper throat area to be used will be equal to or twice the flue area. Once this decision has been made the Inlet Loss Coefficient, K 2, may be determined. If the damper throat area is equal to the flue area, K 2 is equal to 2.5. If the damper throat is twice the flue area, K 2 is equal to 1.0.

Building on Failures Researchers continue on their search for effective new treatments for the more than 120 forms of brain cancer, but they face great challenges.93 Since 1998, there have only been 3 new drug approvals for brain cancer, while another 75 medicines have failed in the development process having been discontinued, suspended, or had no development reported.94 That is a 25:1 ratio of unsuccessful attempts to FDA-approved medicines. Decades of research have provided limited treatment options for patients facing aggressive, late-stage forms of brain cancer. Although challenges persist, researchers continue to use past setbacks to inform future discoveries in brain cancer therapies.
The use of two antimalarials simultaneously, especially when the antimalarials have different mechanisms of action, has the potential for inhib- iting the development of resistance to either of the components. The efficacy of a combination of a 4-aminoquinoline drug (either chloroquine or amo- diaquine) with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine has been reviewed (43). The results of this review sug- gested that the addition of either chloroquine or amodiaquine to SP marginally improved parasitological clearance (compared with SP alone). The studies reviewed were mostly done in areas and at times when both SP and chloroquine/amodi- aquine retained a fair amount of efficacy, and it is not clear from these studies how well such a combination would act in areas where one of the components was significantly compromised. Additionally, to date, there are no data to suggest whether this slightly improved clearance would

The first pass is a quick scan to get a bird’s-eye view of the paper. You can also decide whether you need to do any more passes. This pass should take about five to ten minutes and consists of the following steps:
In the late 1800s, Andrew Taylor Still identified the neuromusculoskeletal system as the key element in health maintenance and stressed preventive aspects of medi- cine in place of drug therapy. During that time, osteop- athy was truly separate and distinct from the world of allo- pathic medicine. Since then, as medicine in general has become more evidence-based and supported by research, osteopathic philosophy has evolved into a more complete and robust osteopathic medicine. The phrase “osteopathic medicine” is now the accepted term for the profession over “osteopathy,” a now-antiquated term that represents a period when Still championed a near-drugless form of manual medicine. Since its conception, osteopathic med- icine has adapted its body of knowledge to incorporate contemporary scientific thought, including germ theory, pharmacology, and other “allopathic” teachings. The cen- tral tenets of osteopathic thought, however, have been maintained and continue to guide DOs in their practice of medicine. Though interprofessional relations between MDs and DOs are better than they have ever been before, challenges still exist in terms of keeping the osteopathic tradition intact, improving the evidence basis of OMM via clinical research, and advocating for widespread recogni- tion of DOs.

the top 10. We also extract and treat as binary features four different types of subjects from Altmetric and CrossRef: Medline subject codes for journal (Altmetric), subjects as indexed by SCOPUS (Altmetric), publisher subjects (Altmetric), and CrossRef subjects. Subjects are mostly at the granularity of the journal or higher. Similar journals have subjects in com- mon, with, for instance, the journals Nature Conservation, Conservation Biology, Ecology and Evolution, and many more sharing the CrossRef subject “nature and landscape conservation.”Multidisciplinaryjournals,suchasPNASand Nature, are often tagged with more general subjects such as “science” or “multidisciplinary.” Table 2 displays the top 10 CrossRef subjects describing at least 100 articles by aver- age news coverage. As expected, health related subjects top the list, along with those related to the environment. Unfor- tunately, but as expected, “general computer science” and “computational mathematics” secured the last places, at 0.5 and 0.3 news articles on average, respectively. We also extract textual features, when available, for each document: Title, Abstract, Press Release. For scientific ar- ticles with more than one press release, we randomly select one. For each type of text document, we preprocess using a standard English stop word list, extracting counts of un- igrams and bigrams, keeping tokens which appear in more than one document and no more than 80% of documents of the same type in the training set. We keep the 30,000 most frequently occurring features in the training set. We then scale the vectors of counts by tfidf weights fit on the training set. Finally, we create a boolean feature hasPR indicating whether the scientific article received coverage on one of the two prominent press release aggregation websites, Eu- rekAlert! or Science Daily. We hypothesize that mention on one of these would expose the scientific article to more jour- nalists and thus garner more coverage.

Incidence numbers (column 2 = total, columns 3-7 = stages 0-IV, column 8 = stage unknown or “?”, for each row columns 3 through 8 add up to column 2), incidence rates in % for stages 0-IV and stage unknown (columns 9-13 = stages 0-IV, column 14 = stage unknown, for each row columns 9 through 14 add up to 100% up to rounding to 2 digits), and incidence rates for stages I-IV only with stage 0 and stage unknown specifically excluded (columns 15-18 = stages I-IV, for each row columns 15 through 18 add up to 100% up to rounding to 2 digits). The incidence numbers are based on the data for California adults aged 20 and older diagnosed with the cancers listed in column 1 during 2005-2009 as reported in [Morris et al, 2013]. Some cancer sites in column 1 are abbreviated as follows: Breast = female breast, Cervix = cervix uteri, Rectum = rectum and rectosigmoid junction, Kidney = kidney and renal pelvis, liver = liver and intrahepatic bile ducts, Lung = lung and bronchus, Melanoma = melanoma of the skin, Oral = oral cavity and pharynx, Bladder = urinary bladder, Uterine = uterine corpus. For Bladder, stage I includes stage 0 (stage I = stage 0/I).

Proper Sizing-Firebox dimensions should be selected so that the fire fills the combustion chamber during operation. This provides greater heating efficiency. Careful consideration should be given to size of the fireplace opening best suited for the room in which it is to be located. Location and size are important not only from the standpoint of appearance, but also of operation. If the fireplace opening is too small, it may function properly but will not produce enough heat to warm the room. If the opening is too large, a fire that would fill the combustion chamber may overwhelm the room. In such a case, the firebox opening would require a larger flue area and consume larger amounts of interior air even if exterior combustion air is provided. Table 2 provides suggested widths of conventional fireplace openings appropriate for various room sizes. For example, a room with 300 ft2 (28 m2) of floor area is best served by a fireplace with an opening 30 in. (750 mm) to 36 in. (900 mm) wide.

We used an expert provided list of 42 relevant domain terms for the Myocardial Perfusion Imaging domain (a sub-domain of nuclear cardiology) to heuristically test the coverage of our ontology terms. Of these, we found 31 exactly matching terms, 2 morphological variants and 8 phrases that contained the terms from the expert list. Out of this 42 domain terms, 1 term, ‘dyperidamole’, was not found in our ontology (dyperidamole is a drug given during pregnancy). We found that this term didn’t exist in the 618 JNC abstracts we were using. Instead, another term, diperidamole (spelling variant) existed in our term list. To do away with noise in our data, we selected terms with greater than average frequency (2.9) of the 10191 retrieved terms and set that as our threshold. We pruned the list to

Incidentally, when you write a paper, you can expect most reviewers (and readers) to make only one pass over it. Take care to choose coherent section and sub-section titles and to write concise and comprehensive abstracts. If a reviewer cannot understand the gist after one pass, the paper will likely be rejected; if a reader cannot understand the high- lights of the paper after five minutes, the paper will likely never be read.

The structural design of cavity walls should follow either rational or empirical methods. The rational design method is based on the properties of the wall materials and engineering analysis. This method may be used for any structure where high loads are likely or where tall walls are a necessity. The empirical method is generally satisfactory for one and two-story buildings consisting of light construction with limited floor spans and wall heights; and for multistory buildings where unsupported wall heights are not excessive.

(cid:2) The panel recommends that clinicians offer multi- modal analgesia, or the use of a variety of analgesic medications and techniques combined with non- pharmacological interventions, for the treatment of postoperative pain in children and adults (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Multimodal analgesia, defined as the use of a variety of analgesic medication and techniques that target different mechanisms of action in the peripheral and/or central nervous system (which might also be combined with nonpharmacological interventions) might have ad- ditiveorsynergisticeffectsandmoreeffectivepainrelief compared with single-modality interventions. For example, clinicians might offer local anesthetic-based regional (peripheral and neuraxial) analgesic techniques in combination with systemic opioids and other analge- sics as part of a multimodal approach to perioperative pain. Because of the availability of effective nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies for postop- erative pain management, the panel suggests that clini- cians routinely incorporate around the clock nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies into multi- modal analgesia regimens. Systemic opioids might not be required in all patients. One study suggests that it shouldbeavoidedwhennotneeded,becauselimitedev- idence suggests that perioperative opioid therapy might be associated with increased likelihood of long-term opioid use, with its attendant risks.4

return-to-sport progression is individualised and is a function of the injury, the athlete’s age, prior SRC and level of play, and the ability to provide close supervision during the return to activity. The return-to-sport progression presented by the CISG is widely accepted but empiric, without evidence to support either the progression sequence or the time spent in each stage. In general, for young athletes, each stage of the progression should be at least 24 hours without return of symptoms before progressing to the next stage. (C)
The naïve interpretation of this is that no more than 13 candidate compounds would be needed for a reasonable chance of launching one new medicine, and 25 for a com- bination with two NCEs (new chemical entities). How- ever, if one aims for a 90% overall chance of success (P), the number of candidates n, each with a success probabil- ity s (8%) is described by the negative binomial distribu- tion in Eq. 1.

OOP costs in the year of diagnosis came mostly from professional and non-inpatient facility services. Figure 8 shows the level of OOP costs by percentile for all study cancers combined. In general, patient cost-sharing is higher for out-of-network services than in-network. Not surprisingly, cancer patients in the highest decile of OOP spending also incurred the highest portion of OOP costs for out- of-network providers; conversely, patients in the lowest decile incurred the lowest portion of OOP costs for out-of-network providers.

prices of pharmaceuticals grew faster than the collective prices of all goods and services (Fig. 4.6a, p.61). However, the trends in the two countries began to diverge in the late 1980s where the price level of medicines continued to rise faster in the USA, while the growth rate of pharmaceutical prices in Australia seemed to have been stabilized at around 10% higher than the consumer price index. This could possibly be due to the introduction of “cost effectiveness” as a requirement before listing a medicine on the national pharmaceutical insurance scheme, so as to ensure the benefits of a given medicine were high enough to justify the price requested by the manufacturer (246). The divergence became more prominent when the Australian Government undertook further reforms of its national scheme after 2005 (247), which was implemented in response to a report that warned “in 40 years’ time, the PBS could account for 3.4% of GDP, making it the largest part of the Government’s spending on health” (248). The reforms seem to have resulted in gradual normalization of the growth rate of medicine prices in Australia to a level in line with the overall inflation rate of other consumer goods (Fig. 4.6a). In contrast, medicine prices continued to grow considerably in the USA, with the cumulative growth reaching 2.4 times the overall inflation rate of other consumer goods in 2017. Of note, the price level of prescription medicines in the USA rose in parallel with Pricing and reimbursement policies in Australia over four decades have controlled the growth rate of medicine prices.

Based on the size of the flue selected, a preliminary damper size must be assumed. At this point in the design process, it is only necessary to decide if the damper throat area to be used will be equal to or twice the flue area. Once this decision has been made the Inlet Loss Coefficient, K 2, may be determined. If the damper throat area is equal to the flue area, K 2 is equal to 2.5. If the damper throat is twice the flue area, K 2 is equal to 1.0.

Of note, mice under single or combined metformin treatments showed an extended survival, whereas 84% of the nontreat- ed mice succumbed within 1 week after infection (Table 1). In conclusion, metformin treatment in combi- nation with suboptimal dosage of conventional antimalarials is more efficacious in reducing parasite load.

(cid:2) The panel recommends that clinicians offer multi- modal analgesia, or the use of a variety of analgesic medications and techniques combined with non- pharmacological interventions, for the treatment of postoperative pain in children and adults (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Multimodal analgesia, defined as the use of a variety of analgesic medication and techniques that target different mechanisms of action in the peripheral and/or central nervous system (which might also be combined with nonpharmacological interventions) might have ad- ditiveorsynergisticeffectsandmoreeffectivepainrelief compared with single-modality interventions. For example, clinicians might offer local anesthetic-based regional (peripheral and neuraxial) analgesic techniques in combination with systemic opioids and other analge- sics as part of a multimodal approach to perioperative pain. Because of the availability of effective nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies for postop- erative pain management, the panel suggests that clini- cians routinely incorporate around the clock nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies into multi- modal analgesia regimens. Systemic opioids might not be required in all patients. One study suggests that it shouldbeavoidedwhennotneeded,becauselimitedev- idence suggests that perioperative opioid therapy might be associated with increased likelihood of long-term opioid use, with its attendant risks.4

Building on Failures Researchers continue on their search for effective new treatments for the more than 120 forms of brain cancer, but they face great challenges.93 Since 1998, there have only been 3 new drug approvals for brain cancer, while another 75 medicines have failed in the development process having been discontinued, suspended, or had no development reported.94 That is a 25:1 ratio of unsuccessful attempts to FDA-approved medicines. Decades of research have provided limited treatment options for patients facing aggressive, late-stage forms of brain cancer. Although challenges persist, researchers continue to use past setbacks to inform future discoveries in brain cancer therapies.

somnolence as a side effect is reproducible in susceptible individuals (White and Rumbold 1988). Sedation is a com- mon side effect of the traditional antipsychotics, with chlorpromazine and thioridazine somewhat more sedating than haloperidol. Clinical studies have shown a high inci- dence of persistent sedation with clozapine (46%) with less frequent reports of sedation with risperidone, olanzapine, sertindole and quetiapine (Monti et al. 2016). The sed- ation associated with these agents is most likely associated with their known effects on histaminic receptors. Doxepin, a sedating psychotropic agent with pro- nounced histamine (H-1) receptor antagonism exerts at least part of its effects by antagonizing orexin (Krystal et al. 2013). Suvorexant, is an orexin antagonist designed to lower waking arousal (Norman and Anderson 2016). Currently, it is being heavily marketed as a hypnotic (Rhyne and Anderson 2015). As based on performance and driving tests, this agent is known to produce a dose-related next day increase in somnolence for all age groupings tested (Farkus 2013). Sedative drug effects on daytime sleepiness are summarized in Table 4.

Traditional Classification algorithms       [37]
The numbers in each block are codes for the treatment given to each animal. The purpose of such a design is to reduce heterogeneity associated with time, space and some physical varia- tion. The five animals in Block 1 would be chosen to be as similar as possible with respect to age, weight, genotype and any other variable which might influence the outcome. They would then be assigned at random to one of the five treatments. The animals would be housed in close proximity, and possibly even in the same cage, if the different treatments can be given in such a situation. When measurements are to be made on the animals, those in Block 1 would be treated as a group, with all measurements being made within a short period by the same per- son. Animals in the other blocks would likewise be selected to be as uniform as possible, but might differ in body weight or age, etc. from those in Block 1. They could be measured at a dif- ferent time, if necessary by a different person. Thus, within each block any comparison among treatments would be made on animals which are in all possible ways as similar as possible. The unwanted variation shows up as differences between blocks. This is then removed mathe- matically in the statistical analysis.
Return-to-sport progressions should be individualised based on the injury, athlete’s age, history and level of play, and the ability to provide close supervision during the return to activity, and progressions may vary between athletes. Each stage is generally 24 hours without return of concussion symptoms. Consider written clearance from a healthcare professional before return to sport as directed by local laws and regulations.3

medicine (NMM) and OMM obtain many more hundreds of hours of manual medicine training in a wider variety of clinical settings than DCs and other DOs. This section was meant to give you a better sense of what “osteopathic manipulative medicine” entails, and hopefully it answered most of your questions regarding OMM. The effectiveness of OMM remains a topic of ongoing debate and research despite past and current efforts to lay these arguments to rest. Whether an osteo- pathic physician uses OMM in his or her practice is based entirely on preference. With that said, it is an important core discipline and primary distinction of the osteopathic profession.

Effective immediately, hospitals shall notify an EMS provider if a patient transported to the hospital by that provider’s EMS crew subsequently tests positive for the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus. Notification must occur within 48 hours of the positive test result. This is a change from the previous 12-hour notification requirement. Notification of a positive test result is required regardless of whether CDC’s recommended use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during transport of any individual with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 was observed. Notification shall not include the name of the patient who tested positive.

Results from the tests showed that the average value of critical thinking ability to the average achievement after the testing ended, showed the relationship was statistically significant (.05). As a result, the researchers compared the results of Table 4 and determined that after the posttest, data showed the average of critical thinking ability and post-learning achievement were higher than before the study.

somnolence as a side effect is reproducible in susceptible individuals (White and Rumbold 1988). Sedation is a com- mon side effect of the traditional antipsychotics, with chlorpromazine and thioridazine somewhat more sedating than haloperidol. Clinical studies have shown a high inci- dence of persistent sedation with clozapine (46%) with less frequent reports of sedation with risperidone, olanzapine, sertindole and quetiapine (Monti et al. 2016). The sed- ation associated with these agents is most likely associated with their known effects on histaminic receptors. Doxepin, a sedating psychotropic agent with pro- nounced histamine (H-1) receptor antagonism exerts at least part of its effects by antagonizing orexin (Krystal et al. 2013). Suvorexant, is an orexin antagonist designed to lower waking arousal (Norman and Anderson 2016). Currently, it is being heavily marketed as a hypnotic (Rhyne and Anderson 2015). As based on performance and driving tests, this agent is known to produce a dose-related next day increase in somnolence for all age groupings tested (Farkus 2013). Sedative drug effects on daytime sleepiness are summarized in Table 4.
Proper Sizing-Firebox dimensions should be selected so that the fire fills the combustion chamber during operation. This provides greater heating efficiency. Careful consideration should be given to size of the fireplace opening best suited for the room in which it is to be located. Location and size are important not only from the standpoint of appearance, but also of operation. If the fireplace opening is too small, it may function properly but will not produce enough heat to warm the room. If the opening is too large, a fire that would fill the combustion chamber may overwhelm the room. In such a case, the firebox opening would require a larger flue area and consume larger amounts of interior air even if exterior combustion air is provided. Table 2 provides suggested widths of conventional fireplace openings appropriate for various room sizes. For example, a room with 300 ft2 (28 m2) of floor area is best served by a fireplace with an opening 30 in. (750 mm) to 36 in. (900 mm) wide.

The naïve interpretation of this is that no more than 13 candidate compounds would be needed for a reasonable chance of launching one new medicine, and 25 for a com- bination with two NCEs (new chemical entities). How- ever, if one aims for a 90% overall chance of success (P), the number of candidates n, each with a success probabil- ity s (8%) is described by the negative binomial distribu- tion in Eq. 1.

Antimalarial efficacy screening: in vitro and in vivo protocols. Supplemental file. animals are prepared and stained with Giemsa. Parasitemia is determined microscopically by counting 4 fields of approximately 100 erythrocytes per field. For low parasitemias (&lt;1%), up to 4000 erythrocytes have to be counted. Alternatively the parasitemia can also be determined by FACS analysis, which works particularly well for parasitemias &gt;1%. The difference between the mean value of the control group (taken as 100%) and those of the experimental groups is calculated and expressed as percent reduction (= activity) using the following equation:

The TSST method has been used to study the effects of oral propranolol in volunteer subjects [25-28]. The assessments of psychic anxiety can be assessed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) or other similar tools [29,30]. The somatic and psychic effects of oral propranolol were tested using the TSST method in healthy adult volunteers. Propranolol (40 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, reduced systolic blood pressure, and enhanced cognitive flexibility during stress. In another study propranolol (80 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, but paradoxically increased salivary cortisol, and did not significantly affect BP or subjective stress [25]. But, in another TSST study daily oral propranolol (80 mg) did not affect the salivary cortisol response [27].

The structural design of cavity walls should follow either rational or empirical methods. The rational design method is based on the properties of the wall materials and engineering analysis. This method may be used for any structure where high loads are likely or where tall walls are a necessity. The empirical method is generally satisfactory for one and two-story buildings consisting of light construction with limited floor spans and wall heights; and for multistory buildings where unsupported wall heights are not excessive.

The numbers in each block are codes for the treatment given to each animal. The purpose of such a design is to reduce heterogeneity associated with time, space and some physical varia- tion. The five animals in Block 1 would be chosen to be as similar as possible with respect to age, weight, genotype and any other variable which might influence the outcome. They would then be assigned at random to one of the five treatments. The animals would be housed in close proximity, and possibly even in the same cage, if the different treatments can be given in such a situation. When measurements are to be made on the animals, those in Block 1 would be treated as a group, with all measurements being made within a short period by the same per- son. Animals in the other blocks would likewise be selected to be as uniform as possible, but might differ in body weight or age, etc. from those in Block 1. They could be measured at a dif- ferent time, if necessary by a different person. Thus, within each block any comparison among treatments would be made on animals which are in all possible ways as similar as possible. The unwanted variation shows up as differences between blocks. This is then removed mathe- matically in the statistical analysis.

1989). In the 1990’s newer agents were developed and marketed that had selective effects on GABA receptors in- cluding Zolpidem (Ambien), Zaleplon (Sonata), Eszopi- clone (Estorra) and Indiplon. While all hypnotics have abuse potential for individuals with addictive histories and personalities, these agents have been noted to have min- imal additive potential (Hajak et al. 2003). These agents are less likely to have deleterious side effects than most OTC treatments for insomnia, however, with increased use, more side effects including next effects on driving have been reported. This effect as well as next day re- bound insomnia has particularly been reported for higher doses of zolpidem (Verster et al. 2002). In many cases, MVA’s occurred in the period of somnolence and cogni- tive impairment during the first few hours after ingestion. Comparatively normal results on psychomotor tests can be obtained 3.25 h. after zaleplon ingestion and 6.25 h. after zopiclone ingestion (Paul et al. 2003). While these agents have excellent efficacy with minimal side effects, at higher doses these agents can exhibit benzodiazepine-like effects. Idiosyncratic reactions of persistent daytime som- nolence and/or memory loss have been reported. Some patients will report next day sedation after the nighttime use of these agents, as well as demonstrate an increased error rate in driving tests (Verster et al. 2007). Such infor- mation was forthcoming only after these drugs became generic and widely utilized in clinical practice. Most sedat- ing drugs if adopted into such widespread use would also be at least as likely to demonstrate epidemiological effects on MVA’s and MVA associated deaths. In the elderly, chronic use of sedating drugs (particularly those with anti-cholinergic side effects) can be associated with an increased risk for falls, and confusion (American Geriatrics Society 2015). Reported next day sleepiness and other side effects associated with hypnotic use are summarized in Table 3. The newer GABA-effective hypnotics are the only medications with demonstrated effectiveness in treating chronic insomnia (NIH State of the Science Conference

the top 10. We also extract and treat as binary features four different types of subjects from Altmetric and CrossRef: Medline subject codes for journal (Altmetric), subjects as indexed by SCOPUS (Altmetric), publisher subjects (Altmetric), and CrossRef subjects. Subjects are mostly at the granularity of the journal or higher. Similar journals have subjects in com- mon, with, for instance, the journals Nature Conservation, Conservation Biology, Ecology and Evolution, and many more sharing the CrossRef subject “nature and landscape conservation.”Multidisciplinaryjournals,suchasPNASand Nature, are often tagged with more general subjects such as “science” or “multidisciplinary.” Table 2 displays the top 10 CrossRef subjects describing at least 100 articles by aver- age news coverage. As expected, health related subjects top the list, along with those related to the environment. Unfor- tunately, but as expected, “general computer science” and “computational mathematics” secured the last places, at 0.5 and 0.3 news articles on average, respectively. We also extract textual features, when available, for each document: Title, Abstract, Press Release. For scientific ar- ticles with more than one press release, we randomly select one. For each type of text document, we preprocess using a standard English stop word list, extracting counts of un- igrams and bigrams, keeping tokens which appear in more than one document and no more than 80% of documents of the same type in the training set. We keep the 30,000 most frequently occurring features in the training set. We then scale the vectors of counts by tfidf weights fit on the training set. Finally, we create a boolean feature hasPR indicating whether the scientific article received coverage on one of the two prominent press release aggregation websites, Eu- rekAlert! or Science Daily.

6. Evaluating – can include commenting on the degrees of success and failure of something, or the value of something The ability to analyze and creatively adapt to new situations is at the heart of critical thinking. Paul and Elder (2008, 2014b) asserted that critical thinking provides a vehicle for educating the mind. John Dewey would agree, as from his early work, we have increased our sense of the pragmatic basis of human thought (its instrumental nature), and especially its grounding in actual human purposes, goals, and objectives. Dewey (1910) also discussed critical thinking in terms of reflective thinking, which is an uneasiness in accepting the status quo and that critical thinking is both an emotional and intellectual component. Students must, therefore, be taught to examine, poke, question, and reflect on what they have learned. Scepticism, questioning, and reflection is essential. Dewey also stated that schools should have an intimate relationship with the community it serves. From the review of the research concerning critical thinking and what components are considered important in high school education and later a life-long learning skill, the authors developed a 5-step, critical thinking teaching process as outlined in Table 2. Input from the study’s nine experts who reviewed the model and from suggestions from other model developers, led to the selection of easy to remember letters that describe each step’s process.
For the (2 vs. 2) SVM schema, one can observe from Table 6 that the highest overall accuracy is 0.91 and generated by a feature combination of POS-based unigrams and K-array semantics-based sequential features, regardless of whether WordNet is used to correct the POS of a unigram or not. In terms of the kernel functions, a linear kernel is used at the first level of the SVM model and a polynomial kernel at the second level. In addition, we notice that the inclusion of bigrams (the last four rows in Table 6) does not improve accuracy but rather reduce the accuracy. This agrees with results reported in previous studies. Tables 7 and 8 present the confusion matrices resulted from the two best feature sets using the (2 vs. 2) SVM schema. These two tables elaborate the two optimal feature sets as highlighted in Table 6. Results are obtained by using a linear and a polynomial kernel at the two levels respectively and averaged over 10-fold cross validation. Notice that in certain cases, the model cannot ditinguish between positive and neutral polarities due to the reasons discussed above; while negative and no-relationship can often be correctly identified.
The increase in full-text downloads for open access articles during their first year after publication suggests that the primary benefit to the nonsubscriber commu- nity is in browsing, as opposed to printing or saving, which would have been indicated by a commensurate increase in PDF downloads. The decrease in abstract views suggests a reader preference for the full docu- ment when available.

Of note, mice under single or combined metformin treatments showed an extended survival, whereas 84% of the nontreat- ed mice succumbed within 1 week after infection (Table 1). In conclusion, metformin treatment in combi- nation with suboptimal dosage of conventional antimalarials is more efficacious in reducing parasite load.

Your child has been identified as needing services for English Language Learners (ELL). Your child will be placed in the ESL/Bilingual Education dual language immersion program, as outlined in the attached document. We believe that this program will help meet your child’s educational needs and enhance his/her academic success in school. Your child will be assessed twice yearly, or as needed, to determine progress toward individual ELL goals. When your child scores in the acceptable range (4.5 Literacy/5.0 Overall) on all areas of the W-APT or ACCESS assessment they will be exited from the program. If your student currently has an Individualized Education Program (IEP), their needs will continue to be met through their current accommodations.

In this paper, we describe a novel feature space designed to effectively classify the polarity and strength of relationships extracted from biomedical abstracts. In addition to the conventional syntactic features such as unigrams and bigrams, we have also explored and constructed semantics-based sequential features. These features are constructed at three different levels: entity, phrase, and sentence. A wrapper-based method is then used to select the optimal feature sets for both polarity and strength prediction. Specifically, a multi-stage SVM classifier and an SVR predictor are built for polarity and strength prediction, respectively. Two different schemas, namely, (1 vs. all) and (2 vs. 2), are employed to build the multi-stage SVM. Finally, three different kernel functions are considered at different stage of this SVM classifier. Our intensive evaluations have shown that for polarity prediction, the (2 vs. 2) schema in general works better than the (1 vs. all). It produces the highest polarity accuracy of 0.91 when both unigrams and semantics-based sequential structures (KSS) are used, with a standard error ranging between 0.01~0.02. On the other hand, we find that for strength prediction, unigrams solely can produce satisfying results. We obtain a high accuracy of 0.96, with the standard error ranging between 0.61%~0.63% for the strength analysis. We are currently expanding our annotated corpus to facilitate further validation of the findings reported in this work. We are also integrating this module with other modules as shown in Figure 1 towards building a quantitative food-disease-gene network. Finally, we are creating an interactive user interface to visually present this network.

1. Decide when to clean. Mortar must harden prior to cleaning. It is generally best to schedule cleaning at least seven days after brickwork is completed. In some cases it may be possible to clean earlier; how- ever, effects on the masonry and influencing factors such as weather conditions and the type of brick and mortar should be carefully considered. Prolonged time periods between the completion of the masonry and cleaning should be avoided. After one month, mortar smears and splatters left on brickwork become increasingly difficult to remove. 2. Remove larger clumps of mortar using wooden paddles or nonmetallic tools. Metal tools may damage the brickwork or leave behind fragments that oxidize and cause rust stains. 3. Select the proper cleaning solution. There are many types of proprietary cleaners available that are for- mulated to remove specific stains or for use with a particular type of brick. Be careful to select cleaning products suitable for the brick, mortar and adjacent materials and follow the cleaner manufacturer’s rec- ommended instructions. Each product being considered should be evaluated as discussed previously in Trial Cleaning.

ability to sleep and the daytime consequences of poor sleep, dis- torted beliefs and attitudes about the origins and meaning of the insomnia, maladaptive efforts to accommodate to the condition (e.g., schedule or lifestyle changes), and excessive time spent awake in bed. The latter behavior is of particular significance in that it often is associated with “trying hard” to fall asleep and growing frustration and tension in the face of wakefulness. Thus, the bed becomes associated with a state of waking arousal as this conditioning paradigm repeats itself night after night.

Based on the size of the flue selected, a preliminary damper size must be assumed. At this point in the design process, it is only necessary to decide if the damper throat area to be used will be equal to or twice the flue area. Once this decision has been made the Inlet Loss Coefficient, K 2, may be determined. If the damper throat area is equal to the flue area, K 2 is equal to 2.5. If the damper throat is twice the flue area, K 2 is equal to 1.0.

When analyzing the data, we found that there does not exist a CUI de(cid:2)nition for a large number of pos- sible concepts. Table 5 shows the number of words in the CUI and ST de(cid:2)nitions for each concept in the NLM-WSD dataset. Only four target words have a CUI de(cid:2)nition for each possible concept. We also found the concept de(cid:2)nitions vary widely in length. The CUI de(cid:2)nitions in the UMLS come from a va- riety of sources and there may exist more than one de(cid:2)nition per source. Unlike CUI de(cid:2)nitions, there does exist an ST de(cid:2)nition for each possible con- cept. The ST de(cid:2)nitions come from the same source and are approximately the same length but they are a broad categorization. We believe this makes them too coarse grained to provide descriptive enough in- formation about their associated concepts.

1. Describing – by clearly defining what you are talking about, what specifically was involved, where it took place and under what circumstances. 2. Reflecting – reconsidering a topic by taking into account new information or a new experience, or considering other viewpoints. 3. Analyzing – examining and then explaining how something is, including comparing and contrasting different elements and understanding relationships to your subject/topic. 4. Critiquing – identifying and examining weaknesses in arguments, as well as acknowledging its strengths. It’s important to think of critiquing as ‘neutral’ and not negative. 5. Reasoning – using methods such as cause and effect to demonstrate logical thinking, as well as presenting evidence that either refutes or proves an argument.
I have enclosed a copy of the white paper for your review. I and my staff would be happy to discuss these ideas more fully. I hope that you will not hesitate to contact me if we can be of assistance.

6. Evaluating – can include commenting on the degrees of success and failure of something, or the value of something The ability to analyze and creatively adapt to new situations is at the heart of critical thinking. Paul and Elder (2008, 2014b) asserted that critical thinking provides a vehicle for educating the mind. John Dewey would agree, as from his early work, we have increased our sense of the pragmatic basis of human thought (its instrumental nature), and especially its grounding in actual human purposes, goals, and objectives. Dewey (1910) also discussed critical thinking in terms of reflective thinking, which is an uneasiness in accepting the status quo and that critical thinking is both an emotional and intellectual component. Students must, therefore, be taught to examine, poke, question, and reflect on what they have learned. Scepticism, questioning, and reflection is essential. Dewey also stated that schools should have an intimate relationship with the community it serves. From the review of the research concerning critical thinking and what components are considered important in high school education and later a life-long learning skill, the authors developed a 5-step, critical thinking teaching process as outlined in Table 2. Input from the study’s nine experts who reviewed the model and from suggestions from other model developers, led to the selection of easy to remember letters that describe each step’s process.

The structural design of cavity walls should follow either rational or empirical methods. The rational design method is based on the properties of the wall materials and engineering analysis. This method may be used for any structure where high loads are likely or where tall walls are a necessity. The empirical method is generally satisfactory for one and two-story buildings consisting of light construction with limited floor spans and wall heights; and for multistory buildings where unsupported wall heights are not excessive.

Incidentally, when you write a paper, you can expect most reviewers (and readers) to make only one pass over it. Take care to choose coherent section and sub-section titles and to write concise and comprehensive abstracts. If a reviewer cannot understand the gist after one pass, the paper will likely be rejected; if a reader cannot understand the high- lights of the paper after five minutes, the paper will likely never be read.

Based on the size of the flue selected, a preliminary damper size must be assumed. At this point in the design process, it is only necessary to decide if the damper throat area to be used will be equal to or twice the flue area. Once this decision has been made the Inlet Loss Coefficient, K 2, may be determined. If the damper throat area is equal to the flue area, K 2 is equal to 2.5. If the damper throat is twice the flue area, K 2 is equal to 1.0.

somnolence as a side effect is reproducible in susceptible individuals (White and Rumbold 1988). Sedation is a com- mon side effect of the traditional antipsychotics, with chlorpromazine and thioridazine somewhat more sedating than haloperidol. Clinical studies have shown a high inci- dence of persistent sedation with clozapine (46%) with less frequent reports of sedation with risperidone, olanzapine, sertindole and quetiapine (Monti et al. 2016). The sed- ation associated with these agents is most likely associated with their known effects on histaminic receptors. Doxepin, a sedating psychotropic agent with pro- nounced histamine (H-1) receptor antagonism exerts at least part of its effects by antagonizing orexin (Krystal et al. 2013). Suvorexant, is an orexin antagonist designed to lower waking arousal (Norman and Anderson 2016). Currently, it is being heavily marketed as a hypnotic (Rhyne and Anderson 2015). As based on performance and driving tests, this agent is known to produce a dose-related next day increase in somnolence for all age groupings tested (Farkus 2013). Sedative drug effects on daytime sleepiness are summarized in Table 4.

□ Structured English Immersion (SEI): Students who score at less than reasonable fluency are placed in a SEI program setting and are taught overwhelmingly in English, but may be supported in the students’ primary language. English learners receive instruction in ELD and other core subjects through effective teaching strategies from trained and authorized teachers using district-adopted textbooks and supplementary instructional materials. Instruction is based on ELD and grade-level content standards.
In the future, we would also like to increase the size of our con(cid:3)ated dataset and possibly create a biomedical all-words disambiguation test set to test our approach. Unlike SenseClusters, our approach can be used to perform all-words disambiguation. For example, given the sentence: His weight has fluctuated during the past month. We (cid:2)rst create a instance vector containing fluctuated, past and months for the word weight and a concept vector for each of its possible concepts, (cid:147)C0005912: Body Weight(cid:148) and (cid:147)C0699807: Quantitative Concept(cid:148) us- ing their context descriptions. We then calculate the cosine between the instance vector and each of the two concept vectors. The concept whose vector has the smallest cosine score is assigned to weight. We then repeat this process for fluctuated, past and months. We also plan to explore using different contex- tual information to improve the accuracy of our approach. We are currently exploring using co- occurrence and relational information about the pos- sible CUIs in the UMLS. Our IDF stoplist exper-

The prevailing models of emergency medical transport used in North America and Western Europe are quite costly and would be impractical for most low-income countries. Severe resource constraints, the poor condition of roads or trails, and a lack of fuel may dictate the utilization of a wider range of options. In the United Republic of Tanzania, for example, modes of emergency transportation include motor- boats, canoes, bicycles with trailers, tricycles with platforms, tractors with trailers, reconditioned vehicles, and ox carts (22).

under mefloquine or metformin single-drug treatments (P = 0.013 and P = 0.041; Figure 3C). Of note, mice under single or combined metformin treatments showed an extended survival, whereas 84% of the nontreat- ed mice succumbed within 1 week after infection (Table 1). In conclusion, metformin treatment in combi- nation with suboptimal dosage of conventional antimalarials is more efficacious in reducing parasite load.

The inclusion of SPX Weeklys in the VIX Index calculation means that the near-term options will always have more than 23 days to expiration and the next-term options always have less than 37 days to expiration, so the resulting VIX Index value will always reflect an interpolation of σ2 1 and σ2 2 ; i.e., each individual weight is less than or equal to 1 and the sum of the weights equals 1.

medicine when following up n candidate molecules. The numerical solutions for this equation show that at least 48 molecules are to be evaluated for this probability to exceed 90%. The MMV discovery portfolio was built and funded to deliver two new preclinical candidates per year, and allowing for a third molecule coming from else- where, then this would still require some 16 years’ invest- ment per combination, except if there is a considerable increase in success rates going forwards (and a justifica- tion for this), or significantly increased investment. The hope on the horizon is that many of the new molecules are first-in-class, and so should they fail in clinical devel- opment there will be scope for well-defined back-up pro- jects, and these are normally much more cost-effective programmes. The definition of new molecular targets also opens up new possibilities for engaging the wider research community, allowing access to resources such as the EU’s European Lead Factory, which considers molec- ular targets but not phenotypic approaches.

Issue: In 1998, ITU Recommendation E.212 was modified allowing IMSI assignments to those Wireline Service Providers offering limited mobility services. As a result, HNI assignments are no longer available exclusively to CMRS providers. The current IMSI assignment and administrative guidelines do not however reflect these modifications.

The structural design of cavity walls should follow either rational or empirical methods. The rational design method is based on the properties of the wall materials and engineering analysis. This method may be used for any structure where high loads are likely or where tall walls are a necessity. The empirical method is generally satisfactory for one and two-story buildings consisting of light construction with limited floor spans and wall heights; and for multistory buildings where unsupported wall heights are not excessive.
Incidentally, when you write a paper, you can expect most reviewers (and readers) to make only one pass over it. Take care to choose coherent section and sub-section titles and to write concise and comprehensive abstracts. If a reviewer cannot understand the gist after one pass, the paper will likely be rejected; if a reader cannot understand the high- lights of the paper after five minutes, the paper will likely never be read.

The FDA recently recommended that a warning be issued regarding adverse effects associated with BzRA hypnotics. These medications have been associated with reports of disruptive sleep related behaviors including sleepwalking, eating, driving, and sexual behavior. Patients should be cautioned about the potential for these adverse effects, and about the importance of allowing appropriate sleep time, using only prescribed doses and avoiding the combination of BzRA hypnotics with alcohol, other sedatives, and sleep restriction. General comments about sedatives/hypnotics:

A patient’s decision to use an OON provider selection may be intentional or accidental. Reasons patients may incur OON costs include patient preference for a particular provider or specialty care center that may be out of network, the lack of network providers with appropriate specialists, and the lack of awareness or transparency about which providers are in the patient’s plan network. Common scenarios for accidental use of OON providers are emergency care or care from an OON provider working at an in-network hospital (e.g., radiologist, assistant surgeon, anesthesiologist).22 23 Figure 9 suggests that there might be significant financial consequences to the patient going out of network, which could be exacerbated if health plans remove popular cancer providers from their networks. Figure 9 also provides information on the relationship between the OON percentage (right vertical axis--relative to total spending) and total patient cost-sharing (left vertical axis). While most patients in our study reported under 10% of all OOP cost in the year of diagnosis is spent on out-of- network providers, those in the highest percentile of OOP spending incurred as much as 40% of those costs out-of-network.

There are debates about whether the returns generated from the sales of medicines, including cancer medicines, are sufficient for pharmaceutical companies to cover their past R&amp;D expenses, maintain their operations and engage in future drug discovery research. For example, some commentators have observed that the revenue generated from the sales of imatinib had exceeded the costs of R&amp;D within two years and “the revenues over the subsequent years of the patent would represent generous profits to the company” (30). Another study found that total revenue from the sales of 10 cancer medicines since approval over a median of four years (US$ 67.0 billion) was 9.3 times the total R&amp;D spending of US$ 7.2 billion (or 7.4 times using an estimated risk-adjusted R&amp;D costs of US$ 9.1 billion) (94).

Properties of insulation materials vary widely. Table 3 shows various properties of insulation materials used in brick masonry cavity walls. The thermal conductivity (k) and thermal resistance (R) provide a means of comparing the insulating properties of insulation materials. These are determined in accordance with ASTM C 177 Test Method for Steady-State Heat Flux Measurements and Thermal Transmission Properties by Means of the Guarded-Hot-Plate Apparatus measured at various temperatures. Due to the large number of types of insulation, and even larger number of manufacturers, Table 3 lists only a few representative values of physical properties. For some materials, an aged or stabilized value is given. In all cases, the aged or stabilized value is the one that should be used in design. Individual manufacturers should be consulted for design values and other properties of their specific materials and their applications.

Building on Failures Researchers continue on their search for effective new treatments for the more than 120 forms of brain cancer, but they face great challenges.93 Since 1998, there have only been 3 new drug approvals for brain cancer, while another 75 medicines have failed in the development process having been discontinued, suspended, or had no development reported.94 That is a 25:1 ratio of unsuccessful attempts to FDA-approved medicines. Decades of research have provided limited treatment options for patients facing aggressive, late-stage forms of brain cancer. Although challenges persist, researchers continue to use past setbacks to inform future discoveries in brain cancer therapies.
veys, and frequent teleconference discussions, the expert panel identified consensus areas and recommendations for those areas not covered by AASM practice parameters. Recommendations were generated by panel members and discussed by all. To min- imize individual expert bias, the group anonymously voted and rated consensus recommendations from 1: strongly disagree to 9: strongly agree. Consensus was defined when all experts rated a recommendation 8 or 9. If consensus was not evident after the first vote, the consensus recommendations were discussed again, amended as appropriate, and a second anonymous vote was conducted. If consensus was not evident after the second vote, the process was repeated until consensus was attained to include or exclude a recommendation.
Antimalarial efficacy screening: in vitro and in vivo protocols. Supplemental file. animals are prepared and stained with Giemsa. Parasitemia is determined microscopically by counting 4 fields of approximately 100 erythrocytes per field. For low parasitemias (&lt;1%), up to 4000 erythrocytes have to be counted. Alternatively the parasitemia can also be determined by FACS analysis, which works particularly well for parasitemias &gt;1%. The difference between the mean value of the control group (taken as 100%) and those of the experimental groups is calculated and expressed as percent reduction (= activity) using the following equation:

The strength and moisture penetration resistance of a brick masonry cavity wall are affected by the mortar selection and compatibility with the brick units. Portland cement-lime, mortar cement, or masonry cement mortars can be used. However, mortars with an air content less than 12 percent are recommended for their superior bond strength and resistance to moisture penetration. The MSJC Code requires that the allowable flexural tensile stresses be reduced by approximately 50 percent for assemblies constructed with masonry cement mortars or portland cement-lime mortars that have air entrainment. In addition, some building codes prohibit the use of masonry cement mortars and all Type N mortars in Seismic Performance Categories D and E (formerly Seismic Zones 3 and 4). Mortar should meet the proportion requirements of ASTM C 270 Specification for Mortar for Unit Masonry as shown in Table 1. Mortar type selection should be based on project requirements, such as strength and compatibility with a particular brick unit. Types N or S mortars are typically used in brick masonry cavity walls. See Technical Notes 8 Series for more detailed information on mortar types and selection.

the top 10. We also extract and treat as binary features four different types of subjects from Altmetric and CrossRef: Medline subject codes for journal (Altmetric), subjects as indexed by SCOPUS (Altmetric), publisher subjects (Altmetric), and CrossRef subjects. Subjects are mostly at the granularity of the journal or higher. Similar journals have subjects in com- mon, with, for instance, the journals Nature Conservation, Conservation Biology, Ecology and Evolution, and many more sharing the CrossRef subject “nature and landscape conservation.”Multidisciplinaryjournals,suchasPNASand Nature, are often tagged with more general subjects such as “science” or “multidisciplinary.” Table 2 displays the top 10 CrossRef subjects describing at least 100 articles by aver- age news coverage. As expected, health related subjects top the list, along with those related to the environment. Unfor- tunately, but as expected, “general computer science” and “computational mathematics” secured the last places, at 0.5 and 0.3 news articles on average, respectively. We also extract textual features, when available, for each document: Title, Abstract, Press Release. For scientific ar- ticles with more than one press release, we randomly select one. For each type of text document, we preprocess using a standard English stop word list, extracting counts of un- igrams and bigrams, keeping tokens which appear in more than one document and no more than 80% of documents of the same type in the training set. We keep the 30,000 most frequently occurring features in the training set. We then scale the vectors of counts by tfidf weights fit on the training set. Finally, we create a boolean feature hasPR indicating whether the scientific article received coverage on one of the two prominent press release aggregation websites, Eu- rekAlert! or Science Daily. We hypothesize that mention on one of these would expose the scientific article to more jour- nalists and thus garner more coverage.

For example, in the eval- uation of applicants, osteopathic medical schools place more emphasis on candidates’ interest in and knowledge of osteopathic philosophy. They also are more likely to seek out students who are interested in pursuing careers in primary care and in rural or underserved areas.3 Osteo- pathic admissions programs often view the candidate as a

medicine (NMM) and OMM obtain many more hundreds of hours of manual medicine training in a wider variety of clinical settings than DCs and other DOs. This section was meant to give you a better sense of what “osteopathic manipulative medicine” entails, and hopefully it answered most of your questions regarding OMM. The effectiveness of OMM remains a topic of ongoing debate and research despite past and current efforts to lay these arguments to rest. Whether an osteo- pathic physician uses OMM in his or her practice is based entirely on preference. With that said, it is an important core discipline and primary distinction of the osteopathic profession.

Sexual problems after cancer treatment affect survivors of many different cancers, including breast, bladder, colorectal, prostate, and gynecological.41-44 Issues vary greatly in severity and tend not to be resolved unless specific treatments are provided, which may include medical therapies; non-hormonal, water-based lubricants and moisturizers; and psychoeducational support, group therapy, sexual counseling, marital counseling, or psychotherapy.45
1. Decide when to clean. Mortar must harden prior to cleaning. It is generally best to schedule cleaning at least seven days after brickwork is completed. In some cases it may be possible to clean earlier; how- ever, effects on the masonry and influencing factors such as weather conditions and the type of brick and mortar should be carefully considered. Prolonged time periods between the completion of the masonry and cleaning should be avoided. After one month, mortar smears and splatters left on brickwork become increasingly difficult to remove. 2. Remove larger clumps of mortar using wooden paddles or nonmetallic tools. Metal tools may damage the brickwork or leave behind fragments that oxidize and cause rust stains. 3. Select the proper cleaning solution. There are many types of proprietary cleaners available that are for- mulated to remove specific stains or for use with a particular type of brick. Be careful to select cleaning products suitable for the brick, mortar and adjacent materials and follow the cleaner manufacturer’s rec- ommended instructions. Each product being considered should be evaluated as discussed previously in Trial Cleaning.
