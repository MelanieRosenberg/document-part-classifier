Exposure              Measured   in   Valid?    Reason   (Willett)                               Reason   (Margetts  / Nelson)
Retinol                  Plasma/se    Yes     Can  be measured  adequately, but limited          Main  biochemical  marker  of vit A intake is
rum                  interpretability in well-nourished population (p   serum  retinol (p 194) although in western
190).                                              countries dietary intake of this vitamin is only a
very minor  determinant of its plasma levels.
Retinol-Binding          Serum        Yes     Retinol levels are highly correlated to            May  be measure  of physiologically available
protein                                       RBP(p192).                                         form. Not  if certain disease processes exist (p
192).
Beta-carotene            Plasma       Yes     Yes  (p 194) although blood levels much  more      Yes  (p 197)
responsive to supplemental  beta-carotene than
beta-carotene from  food sources (p 193)
Alpha-carotene           Plasma       Yes     Yes  (p 194)                                       There  is some evidence for interaction between
Beta-cryptoxanthin                                                                               carotenoids during intestinal absorption, which
Lutein+zeaxanthin                                                                                may  complicate  relationship between intake and
Lycopene                                                                                         blood levels (p 198)
Vit E                    Plasma       Yes     Yes  (p 196)                                       Plasma,  red and white blood cells. Yes, if used
NB.  Strong confounding  with serum  cholesterol   for vit E supplements. Yes, although if used for
and total lipid concentrations (p 196).            diet, associations are only moderate (p199)
