!!! URGENTâ€¦      INDUSTRY      RESOLUTION       REQUIRED      !!!
Background: In 1995, the US wireless telecommunications industry developed assignment guidelines for
International Mobile Station Identifier (IMSI) in the US.
These guidelines were developed in an open industry forum sponsored by the Cellular
Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA) and in accordance with ITU Recommendation E.212.
The result of this development effort was the consensus-approved document titled IMSI Assignment
Guidelines and Procedures Version 1.0.
These assignment guidelines pertain exclusively to Commercial Mobile Radio Service providers (CMRS).
The IMSI Administrator directly administers only the Home Network Identity (HNI) segment of the
resource.
The HNI uniquely identifies the home wireless network of a FCC- licensed two-way CMRS subscriber and
contains the Mobile Country Code (MCC) and the Mobile Network Code (MNC).
The remaining segment of the IMSI, the Mobile Station Identification Number (MSIN), is directly
administered by the wireless network licensee to which the HNI is assigned.
Issue: In 1998, ITU Recommendation E.212 was modified allowing IMSI assignments to those Wireline
Service Providers offering limited mobility services.
As a result, HNI assignments are no longer available exclusively to CMRS providers.
The current IMSI assignment and administrative guidelines do not however reflect these
modifications.
Discuss and resolve proposed revisions to the IMSI oversight process.
The current IMSI Management Guidelines and Procedures established an IMSI Management Forum (IMF) and
an IMSI Management Council (IMC).
The oversight procedures should be reassessed in light of proposed changes to the Assignment
Guidelines as well as other technical and administrative issues affecting this resource.
