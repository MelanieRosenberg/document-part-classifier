The preceding paper explains the process and evidence used to develop policies for the Journal of
Forecasting.
Many, though not all, of the policies have been adopted for the Journal.
The policies are reflected in the “Guidelines for Authors” published on the back cover of this issue
and in the “Guidelines for Referees,” in the appendix of this paper.
(A complete Editorial manual is available from the editors.).
We feel that the Journal of Forecasting policies are ambitious.
We propose these policies as a way to obtain better papers and to help authors to increase the
likelihood of publication.
However, violations of these guidelines will not eliminate a paper as a candidate for publication.
We would not be so bold as to suggest these policies define the best procedures for all authors,
associate editors, or referees.
The policies should be an aid, not a restriction.
