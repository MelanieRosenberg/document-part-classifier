ultraviolet light must be evaluated in flashing selection.
Flashing material should not be susceptible to corrosion in fresh mortar or react with adjacent
materials such as rigid insulation.
Flashing should be easily formed into the desired shape.
Compatibility with materials such as sealants or adhesives should be reviewed.
Expected life of the flashing materials should be the expected life of the structure, at a minimum.
All of these qualities of the flashing material must be taken into consideration in selection
because replacement is expensive.
Table 2 describes the thickness and advantages and disadvantages of flashing materials that can be
installed in brick masonry cavity walls.

Sheet metals used for flashing include stainless steel, copper, lead-coated copper and galvanized
steel.
Aluminum should not be used since it can corrode in fresh mortar.
Stainless steel and copper materials are the most durable, but are also the most expensive.
Galvanized steel has also been used in limited applications.
These flashing materials have a greater life expectancy than composite or fabric flashing.
Sheet metal flashing is bent and formed on site and sealed by soldering or with adhesives and
rivets.
This additional installation time can result in additional construction costs.
Stainless steel materials should conform the ASTM A 167 Specification for Stainless and
Heat-Resisting Steel Plate, Sheet and Strip.
Copper flashing should comply with ASTM B 370 Specification for Copper Sheet and Strip for Building
Construction.
Solder should conform to ASTM B 32 Specification for Solder Metal.
Composite or combination flashings are typically less expensive than sheet metal and are easier to
install.
The most predominant type is a thin layer of metal sandwiched between one or two layers of another
material.
The metal layer is usually of aluminum, copper or lead.
It is covered on one or both sides with various materials, such as asphalt coatings, kraft paper,
fiberglass fabric or plastic films.
Product literature should be reviewed to determine whether these materials are appropriate for use
in brick masonry cavity walls.
Consideration should be given to compatibility with adjacent sealants, delamination due to moisture
penetration and movement of the wall system.
