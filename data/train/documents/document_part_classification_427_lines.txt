Bandolier Bandolier is an independent organization in Europe that produces reports on evidence-based
medicine.
In 2003, Bandolier issued a report on the treatment of acute pain.
Its evaluation compared many studies and concluded that the opioid medications were no more
effective than the NSAIDs (Bandolier, 2003).
In 2007, Bandolier produced a table comparing the efficacy of many different oral and injectable
medications for pain.
The below excerpt from that table shows the relative strengths of some commonly used medications.
Notice that an injection of 10 mg of morphine is roughly equivalent to an oral dose of OTC
ibuprofen.

Dental pain A recent review article in the Journal of the American Dental Association addressing the
treatment of dental pain following wisdom tooth extraction concluded that 325 mg of acetaminophen
(APAP) taken with 200 mg of ibuprofen provides better pain relief than oral opioids.
Moore et al.
concluded, “The results of the quantitative systematic reviews indicated that the ibuprofen-APAP
combination may be a more effective analgesic, with fewer untoward effects, than are many of the
currently available opioid-containing formulations.” (Moore, 2013, p.
898).
Back pain A recent review article in The Spine Journal looked at multiple treatment options for the
treatment of sciatica – back pain with a pinched nerve with symptoms radiating down one leg.
They found that non-opioid medications provided some positive global effect on the treatment of this
disorder, while the opioids did not.
When looking at the symptom of pain, opioids appeared to have no significant effect.
The non-opioid medications did appear to have a positive effect on the pain, but these results did
not reach statistical significance.
(Lewis et al., 2013).
Radcliff et al.
looked at patients who received opioids initially for treatment of lumbar disc herniation compared
with those who did not.
They found that those receiving opioids had a higher rate of surgery and that, overall, there was no
significant difference four years later.
Opioid medications were associated with an increased crossover to surgical treatment.
Four years after the initiation of treatment, 16 percent of those who received opioids at the start
were still on opioids, whereas only 5 percent of those who were treated with non-opioids initially
were on opioids after four years.
They concluded that those who were initially treated with opioids had a higher rate of surgery and a
greater chance of being on opioids four years later but no significant change in overall outcome
(Radcliff et al., 2013).
