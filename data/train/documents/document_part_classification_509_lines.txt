The following year, the California State Supreme Court overturned the merger legislation from over a
decade prior, thus allowing the reinstatement of an osteo- pathic licensing board, a medical
society, and a new school, now known as Western University of Health Sci- ences College of
Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific.
How- ever, the emergence of government-sponsored insurance and managed care programs brought about
new chal- lenges for the osteopathic profession.
DOs were histori- cally severely underrepresented in the decisions regarding Medicare and Medicaid
reimbursement for osteopathic medical services.
In fact, it was not until 1995 that the first DO was named to serve on the Physician Payment Review
Commission, which advised Congress on policy con- cerning such reimbursements.
Today, numerous issues, including physician reim- bursement, still surround osteopathic medicine.
The most pertinent of these concerns are internship and resi- dency shortages, public awareness and
perception, clinical research on OMM, DO-MD relations, and the effort to dis- tinguish DOs from MDs
in light of the progressive blurring of distinctions between the two professions.
All of these issues are quite complex and are further elaborated on later in this guidebook.

In the late 1800s, Andrew Taylor Still identified the neuromusculoskeletal system as the key element
in health maintenance and stressed preventive aspects of medi- cine in place of drug therapy.
During that time, osteop- athy was truly separate and distinct from the world of allo- pathic
medicine.
Since then, as medicine in general has become more evidence-based and supported by research,
osteopathic philosophy has evolved into a more complete and robust osteopathic medicine.
The phrase “osteopathic medicine” is now the accepted term for the profession over “osteopathy,” a
now-antiquated term that represents a period when Still championed a near-drugless form of manual
medicine.
Since its conception, osteopathic med- icine has adapted its body of knowledge to incorporate
contemporary scientific thought, including germ theory, pharmacology, and other “allopathic”
teachings.
The cen- tral tenets of osteopathic thought, however, have been maintained and continue to guide DOs
in their practice of medicine.
Though interprofessional relations between MDs and DOs are better than they have ever been before,
challenges still exist in terms of keeping the osteopathic tradition intact, improving the evidence
basis of OMM via clinical research, and advocating for widespread recogni- tion of DOs.
