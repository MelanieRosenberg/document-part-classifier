By my signature on this document, I hereby authorize AMEDEX Insurance Company (Bermuda) to directly
debit the credit card that I have identified above for the payment of insurance premiums for my
AMEDEX Insurance Company (Bermuda) life insurance policy, as specifically identified hereinabove.
I understand that, if there are any changes to my AMEDEX Insurance Company (Bermuda) life insurance
policy, the amount of the premium may also change from the above-stated amount.
I further understand that a true and correct copy of this Agreement will be forwarded to my credit
card company and, by my signature on this agreement, I request and instruct them to allow AMEDEX
Insurance Company (Bermuda) to directly debit my credit card account for the payment of life
insurance premiums until such time as I instruct otherwise in writing.
I acknowledge that, in the event that the direct debit of any life insurance premiums by credit card
for my AMEDEX life insurance policy is rejected or declined for any reason, it will become my
personal responsibility to immediately pay the premiums for my life insurance policy, or my policy
may lapse, be terminated and/or cancelled.
