RE:                                               v.
Subpoena    for                                     ’s Education   Records
Dear                                       :
The subpoena seeks a student’s academic records, which are covered by the Family Educational Rights
and Privacy Act of 1974, 20 U.S.C.
§1232g (“FERPA”).
Pursuant to FERPA, the College is unable to release educational records to you without first
providing notice of the subpoenas to the student.
The College has sent a letter to inform the student of this request and will provide him/her with
time to notify it of whether he/she will seek to quash the subpoena.
If the student indicates that he/she does not wish to quash the subpoena, or if he/she does not
respond, the College will release the records to you at that time.
