Medical tourism is becoming a source of economic gain for many countries and regions of the world.
(Carruth and Carruth 2010; Hill n.d.; Kahn 2010) Medical tourism increases the economic situation
(Munro 2012; Pocock and Phua 2011) in a destination country, provides care for many individuals
willing to pay out of pocket, and lowers health insurance costs for U.S.
employers and health insurers willing to pay for health care abroad.
It is difficult to determine, with any accuracy, the number of persons travelling from the U.S alone
to a foreign country for health care reasons.
Estimates of Americans travelling abroad for treatments place the number of persons traveling to
India or Thailand for health care reasons in excess of 750,000 persons for 2005 (Herrick 2007; Kahn
2010).
A 2003 estimate placed the total number of persons traveling to India, Thailand, Singapore, and
Malaysia at 1.4 million persons (Heung, Kucukusta, and Song 2011).
This estimate increased in 2010 to 6 million persons, with an economic gain of > $4 billion, with
half of the revenue going to India (Heung, Kucukusta, and Song 2011; Horowitz, Rosensweig, and Jones
2007; Hill n.d.).
As medical tourism develops into a multi-billion dollar industry, with steady annual growth
projected, estimates of global economic gains vary between $40 and $100 billion for destination
countries (Zwelling 2011; Herrick 2007).
While the increase of health care treatments and procedures performed abroad involves many elective
procedures (Woodman 2010; Synder, Dharamsi and Crooks 2011, Milstein and Smith 2007), which many
U.S.
health insurers deny payment, there is a growing interest by U.S.
health care insurers to pay for more expensive complex procedures, such as Coronary Arterial Bypass
Graft (CABG) surgery.
Coronary bypass surgery, one of the most common cardiac surgical procedures performed, serves as a
“cash cow” for many U.S.
hospitals (Crowley 2010).
Because cardiac surgery procedures provide high revenue, smaller local hospitals can market as
offering a high-profile program in cardiac care even if the hospital has a low volume of bypass
cases, thereby increasing patient volume and revenue (Regenbogen, Gust, Birkmeyer 2012).
Focusing on coronary bypass, a review of Medicare data (1992 – 2003) demonstrates a decline in
coronary bypass surgical procedures from 1992 to 2003, while the number of hospitals performing
these surgeries steadily increased (Wilson, et al.
2007).
Using Nationwide Inpatient Sample data (2001 – 2008), a study by Epstein et al (2011) supports
Wilson’s et al review, demonstrating a decrease in the number of coronary bypass surgeries per
hospital, yet a 12% increase in the number of hospitals during this period.
In an effort to lure Americans to seek care abroad, coronary bypass procedures have become one of
several expensive health care procedures offered by larger health care facilities in India,
Singapore, and Thailand.
This paper focuses on examining the growing interest of U.S.
individuals, employers, and health insurance providers for having coronary bypass performed in
India, Thailand, or Singapore.
Costs of coronary bypass surgery is cited by more U.S.
individuals and companies providing employee health insurance as being the single most important
factor of consideration for seeking coronary bypass surgery abroad.
Table 1 illustrates the cost comparison of coronary bypass surgery in the U.S.
with India, Thailand, and Singapore; these cost comparison figures are promoted throughout the
medical tourism industry.
A comparison study of costs for coronary bypass surgery in two large hospitals in India, one in
Thailand, and the overall California Insurer average cost payment, demonstrates the costs in India
and Thailand did not exceed $15,000 while the California Insurer average (private insurance)
exceeded $50,000 (Milstein and Smith 2007).
