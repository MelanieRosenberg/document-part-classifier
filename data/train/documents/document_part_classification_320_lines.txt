Any proposed automated medical diagnosis system, which is constructed using data mining methodology,
will help the doctors to diagnose the correct disease in less time [33].
Table:1 highlights a few of such system’s leading objectives along with their associated authors
working in the field of predicting medical disease(s) using data mining technique.
Common data mining techniques which are used in almost all the sectors are listed as: Naive Bayes,
Decision Tree, Artificial neural network (ANN), K- nearest neighborhood (KNN), Support vector
machine (SVM) etc.
In order to improve the success of healthcare organization and health of the patients, the knowledge
gained by data mining can be exercised for booming research problems in the associated arena [33].
