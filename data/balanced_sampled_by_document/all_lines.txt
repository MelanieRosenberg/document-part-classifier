COMPLICAÇÕES:

This paper introduces an unsupervised vector ap- proach to disambiguate words in biomedical text us-
ing contextual information from the UMLS.
We believe that our approach shows promise and leads us to our goal of exploring the use of
biomedical knowledge sources.
create a biomedical all-words disambiguation test set to test our approach.
We (cid:2)rst create a instance vector containing fluctuated, past and months for the word weight
and a concept vector for each of its possible concepts, (cid:147)C0005912: Body Weight(cid:148) and
(cid:147)C0699807: Quantitative Concept(cid:148) us- ing their context descriptions.
We then calculate the cosine between the instance vector and each of the two concept vectors.
We also plan to explore using different contex- tual information to improve the accuracy of our
approach.
We are currently exploring using co- occurrence and relational information about the pos- sible CUIs

Table 1 shows the results of our approach using the CUI and ST de(cid:2)nitions as context for the
possi- ble concepts on the NLM-WSD dataset and Table 4 shows similar results using the con(cid:3)ate
dataset.
On the NLM-WSD dataset, the results show a large difference in accuracy between the contexts on a
word by word basis making it dif(cid:2)cult to deter- mine which of the context description performs
the best.
The unigram results show that CUI→ST and CUI+ST obtain the highest accuracy for (cid:2)ve words, and
The bigram results show that CUI→ST and CUI obtains the highest accuracy for two words, ST obtains
the highest accuracy for four words, and CUI+ST obtains the highest accuracy for one word.
the context description CUI→ST obtains the high- est overall accuracy.
On the con(cid:3)ated dataset, the pseudowords a a, a o, d d and e e have a corresponding CUI
de(cid:2)ni- tion for each of their possible concepts therefore the accuracy for CUI and CUI→ would
be the same for these datasets and is not reported.
These experiments were run using the unigram feature.
Table 3 shows the accuracy of the results obtained by our unsupervised vector approach using the
CUI→ST context description, SenseClusters, and the results reported by Humphrey et al.
As seen with the context description results, there exists a large difference in accuracy on a word
by word basis between the approaches.

We report the results for four experiments in this pa- per: i) the results of using the IDF stoplist
the possible concepts of a target word, iii) the results of our approach com- pared to SenseClusters
and Humphrey et al.
(2006) using the NLM-WSD dataset, and iv) the results of our approach compared to SenseClusters
using the con(cid:3)ated dataset.
The results of using an individualized IDF stoplist for each target word show an improvement over
us- ing the basic stoplist.
The results of our approach using different context descriptions show that for the NLM-WSD dataset
the large differences in accuracy makes it unclear which of the context descriptions performed the
best.
On the con(cid:3)ated dataset, adding the ST de(cid:2)nition to the context description improved.
When analyzing the data, we found that there does not exist a CUI de(cid:2)nition for a large number
Table 5 shows the number of words in the CUI and ST de(cid:2)nitions for each concept in the NLM-WSD
Only four target words have a CUI de(cid:2)nition for each possible concept.
Unlike CUI de(cid:2)nitions, there does exist an ST de(cid:2)nition for each possible con- cept.

Regarding Figure 4, it is obvious that with increase in mesh size or decrease in particle size,
surface roughness comes down and results in a finer surface.
Here again to ensure that graph 2 illustrates general behavior of abrasive particle mesh size, all
other conditions were examined and in just one condition a little deviation from regular behavior
had been observed.
mesh number.
Besides, the greater the abrasive particles, the bigger their cutting edges are, so scratches made
by these bigger cutting edges are greater than smaller particles.
Therefore, smaller abrasive particles produce a better surface quality.
Finally, to examine effect of finishing time cycle, last set of experiments with the following
condition has been conducted: Magnetic field strength of 0.8T, abrasive particle mesh size of 400,
finishing cycles of 30, 45 and 60 minutes.
Results are shown in Figure 5.
and as a result, more peaks are removed.
Therefore, surface roughness in this region improves and there will be a finer surface than first.
by continuing abrasion after removal of peaks.
After investigating these parameters independently, it worth compare them together to get a general
layout form their behavior.
Figure 6 illustrates their effect on surface roughness in different conditions.

Data Mining can generate information that can be useful to all stakeholders in health care,
Though data mining methods and tools have been applied in diverse areas for more than 40 years

The new Regulation [European Union (EU)] 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural
persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data
[general data protection regulation (GDPR)], repealing Directive 95/46/EC, strengthens and
harmonises the rules for protecting individuals’ privacy rights and freedoms within and, under
Protection Directive 95/46/EC.
The GDPR fixes both general rules applying to any kind of personal data processing and specific
rules applying to the processing of special categories of personal data such as health data taking
place in the context of scientific research, this including clinical and translational research
This article aims to provide an overview of the new rules to consider where scientific projects
include the processing of personal health data, genetic data or biometric data and other kinds of
facts to researchers to adapt their practices and ensure compliance to the EU law to be enforced in

Pattern Matching.
We developed a pattern- matching classifier as a baseline for our more so- phisticated
classification methods.
A list of all UMLS string representations for each of 45 codes (including synonyms from source
For the same rea- sons, some of the strings were relaxed into pat- terns.
For example, it is unlikely to see PAIN CHEST in a chart, but very likely to find pain in chest.
The string, therefore, was relaxed to the fol- lowing pattern: pain.*chest.
The text of the clinical history and the impression fields of the radiology reports with negated
Each sentence was then searched for all available pat- terns.
This pattern matching achieved F-score = 0.79 on the training set.
To reduce the number of codes assigned to a document, a check for allowed combinations was added as
As the performance of this classifier was compara- ble to other methods, we decided to include these
Experience with ad hoc retrieval tasks in the TREC Genomics Track has shown that combining predic-
tions of several classifiers either significantly im- proves classification results, or at least
provides more consistent and stable results when the train- ing data set is small (Aronson et al.,
2005).
Table 1 shows the results obtained for the training set.
We retained all final predictions with probability of being a valid code greater than 0.3.

The number of paragraphs, however, was smaller in this subcorpus than in the BESP subcorpus.
In fact, three of the 10 ESPj introductions only had one paragraph, whereas BESP introductions
required at least two.
introductions had fewer than three sentences per paragraph while, in the ESPj corpus, three was the

ESPj8 and ESPj9) contain this sequence plus a repetition of one or more moves.
contains a one-sentence Move 1 between a 7-sentence Move 2 and a 7-sentence Move 3 while ESPj7 and
ESPj8 each contain two instances of Move 2, establishing the niche in two separate installments.
With the exception of ESPj2, all the RAIs in this corpus contain a Move 2, and there was only one
instance (i.e., ESPj1) of Move 3-fronting.
ESPj1 did not contain a Move 1 either, being, overall, the introduction that was the most dissimilar
from the model.

claim supported not only by the names of these journals, but also by the similar editorial policies
they hold (see Appendix C).

Free access to scientific articles increases readership (as measured by article downloads) and
reaches a broader audience (as measured by unique IP addresses) but has no effect on article
citations within the first 3 yr after publication.
These results are consistent with earlier trial reports on the physiology literature (14, 15) and
suggest that these claims are generalizable across the scientific, social sciences, and humanities
The increase in full-text downloads for open access articles during their first year after
publication suggests that the primary benefit to the nonsubscriber commu- nity is in browsing, as
opposed to printing or saving, which would have been indicated by a commensurate increase in PDF
The decrease in abstract views suggests a reader preference for the full docu- ment when available.
Prior studies comparing the citation impact of open access articles to subscription access articles
are based on unobtrusive observational methods and may suffer from the failure to adequately control
for confounding variables (8, 13).
While some studies attempt to control statistically for differences in article characteristics,.
such as article type, discipline, and funding source, (9), for example, none were able to control
for abstract qualities such as relevance, novelty, and importance to a field of study, variables
that are unobservable to the researcher.
In addition, an author’s willingness and ability to pay open access publishing fees, some amounting
to several thousands of dollars, may make simple performance comparisons with subscription- access
articles highly problematic (12).

Most article downloads take place within the first few months after publication (17, 18), suggesting
that the primary func- tion of an article is to keep researchers abreast on the latest findings
within a field and secondly to serve as a source document for future citation.

in digital repositories.
To obtain an estimate of the extent and effects of self-archiving, we wrote a Perl script to search
for PDF copies of articles anywhere on the Internet (ignoring the publisher’s website) 1 yr after
We attempted to identify as many instances of self-archiving as possible, while minimizing the
Articles published in the social sciences and humanities journals (n(cid:1)350) were omitted from
the readership analysis, as many did not include abstract or full-text versions of their articles,
and, in some cases, refer- ence views were added to full-text views, resulting in indeter- minate
and incomparable results.
Citation analyses were conducted on the entire article data set (n(cid:1)3245).
A logistic regression model was used to estimate the likelihood of articles in each experimental
group being cited within the first year after publication, controlling for journal and journal
category effects.
Multivariate linear regression models were used to estimate the effect of the open access treatment
on article readership and citations.
Covariates in these models include the journal in which the article appeared, type of article
Continuous variables (page length, number of authors, and number of citations) were log transformed
to adhere to the assumption of normality re- quired for linear regression.
As we were not interested in estimating citation effects for each particular journal, but to control
for the variation in journal effects generally, journals were considered random effects in the
regression models.
While adding 1 shifts the citation distribution to the right, we were interested primarily in the
slopes of the regression lines and not their intercepts.
To interpret the results of the regression equation, estimates of log-transformed variables were

It can conclude that students have demonstrated real-life category often in three strands.
Therefore educational systems have to create new circumferences for mathematics education.
The results of this study have indicated that all students of this research have understood the
But students of humanities strand believed that it is not considered the relation of mathematics to
real-life in teaching mathematics and also students of experimental science strand believed that it
cannot create the relation between taught mathematical subjects and real-life.

Relative perfor- mance on the weekly task is similar to its daily counter- part.
Understandably, performance is best when optimized for and evaluated on smaller ranks for NDCG since

articles which can fill the top 7 or 35.
Segmenting dates by week rather than day may be more realistic, since scientific articles compete
for news coverage with articles published around the same time rather than just those published on
the same day.
At rank 7, the model trained on textual features outperforms the model with all features, but not
statistically significantly.

Again, medical and people-related terms, such as “diet,” “participants,” and “health” are quite
important and of positive polarity.
Inter- estingly, “protein” in the press release is of positive polar- ity on average, whereas it is
negative when present in the abstract.
We hypothesize that this may be because, on aver- age, very technical scientific papers, such as

As seen in Table 3, this problem is harder, with the best performance on the daily task at 0.6065,
many journalists start with press materials to inform what science they cover be- fore reading
original articles.
Table 6 displays the top 20 fea- tures for the daily experiment using all features.
Important features for these experiments are similar to those listed for the experiments including
all scientific articles, except fea- tures from the press release are more prevalent.
This makes sense as press releases were issued for all articles in this sub- set (and we have the
text of most of them), and press releases are an important source text for journalists.
We do not list features from the weekly experiments as they are quite sim- ilar.
In the previous experiments, we treat articles with news cov- erage from only automatic copying of
abstracts or press re- leases as having coverage count 0.
In this section, we also explore the binary prediction problem of differentiating be- tween those 0

We hypothesize that mention on one of these would expose the scientific article to more jour-

Use of recommended colorectal cancer screening tests can both detect cancer early, when treatment is
more effective, and pre- vent cancer, through the detection and removal of precancerous polyps.
However, in 2013, only 59% of adults 50 years of age and older reported receiving colorectal cancer
screening according to guidelines.81.
Surgical procedures for colorectal cancer include local tumor excision or destruction, colectomy
(removal of all or part of the colon), proctectomy (removal of the rectum), and proctocolectomy
The majority of early stage (I and II) colon cancers are treated with colectomy alone (84%), while

In this report, the term “cancer survivor” refers to any person with a history of cancer, from the
time of diagnosis through the remainder of their life.
Henceforth, the terms cancer patient and cancer survivor are used interchangeably without
preference, although it is recognized that not all people with a cancer diag- nosis identify with
The goals of treatment are to “cure” the cancer, if possible; pro- long survival; and provide the
highest possible quality of life during and after treatment.
A cancer is cured when all traces of the cancer have been removed from the patient’s body.
Although it is usually not possible to know if the cancer is completely eradicated, for many

The aim of Phase 1 was to identify the contributions of clinical and laboratory variables that in
practice were the most predictive of the decision to initiate DMARD therapy in a population of
patients with early undifferentiated synovitis.

This analysis permitted the calculation of an individual’s score of the likelihood of developing RA
from 0 to 100, where a higher score indicated greater likelihood of RA development.
The domains, categories, and weights derived during that initial process are shown in Table 2.
In Phase 3 the working group integrated the findings of the first 2 phases, refined the scoring
system, and determined the optimal cut point to define “definite RA.” The goal of this final phase
was to utilize the results of Phases 1 and 2 to develop a scoring system that would be applicable to

somnolence as a side effect is reproducible in susceptible individuals (White and Rumbold 1988).
Sedation is a com- mon side effect of the traditional antipsychotics, with chlorpromazine and
Clinical studies have shown a high inci- dence of persistent sedation with clozapine (46%) with less
2016).
The sed- ation associated with these agents is most likely associated with their known effects on
Doxepin, a sedating psychotropic agent with pro- nounced histamine (H-1) receptor antagonism exerts
at least part of its effects by antagonizing orexin (Krystal et al.
Suvorexant, is an orexin antagonist designed to lower waking arousal (Norman and Anderson 2016).
Currently, it is being heavily marketed as a hypnotic (Rhyne and Anderson 2015).
As based on performance and driving tests, this agent is known to produce a dose-related next day
increase in somnolence for all age groupings tested (Farkus 2013).
Sedative drug effects on daytime sleepiness are summarized in Table 4.
(Dimsdale 1992).
The complaints of tiredness, fatigue and daytime sleepiness (2–4.3%) associated with beta-blocker
Sedation is among the most common side ef- fects reported for the alpha-2 agonists clonidine and
Alpha-1 antagonists (e.g.  terazosin, prazosin) are sometimes associated with transient sedation.
Prazosin, a norepinephine antagonist, has demonstrated value in treating insomnia associated with
PTSD nightmares (Raskind et al.
2003).

In 1999, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) created the National Center for Complementary and
Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) in recognition of this growing field.
Research funding to the NCCAM has risen from $ 2 million in 1992 to $50 million by 2000 and is
A survey conducted in 2005 indicated that approximately 35.9% of cancer patients attempted use of
In fact, that percentage may be even higher as studies have shown that many patients do not disclose
the use of CAM therapy unless asked specifically [3].
Physicians poorly communicate with their patients regarding the potential benefits or harms of CAM
because they have minimal understanding of CAM therapy and its physiological role in managing
diseases [4,5].
Patients are often dissatisfied with their physicians’ lack of knowledge regarding CAM therapy [6].
Patients who have a history of incorporating CAM into their management plan are generally driven by
An increased use of CAM has been seen in patients with increased psychosocial stress or poor
There are numerous modalities of CAM such as spiritual healing or prayer, herbal medicine, and
chiropractics [11].
This review focuses on medicinal therapies used as CAM for patients suffering from malignancy,
Herbal plants that have been used in lung cancer therapy include Platycodon grandiflorum
(Campanulaceae), Morus alba (Moraceae), Prunus armeniaca (Rosaceae), Rhus verniciflua
Although these are used as alternative modes of therapy, it is more common for herbal remedies to be
used as adjuvant modalities with chemotherapy [13].
The role of these herbal therapies is multifactorial.
They can be used to reduce chemotherapy-induced toxicity, mitigate cancer-related symptoms, or
directly increase anti- cancer effects [14].
therapy and showed an enhancement in median survival in the group that was treated with Sheng-mai
and Gu- jin Granule along with Navelbine and Cisplatin [15].
Another study enrolled 232 non-small cell lung cancer patients and showed that Shenqi-fuzheng, an
herbal injection similar to Sheng- mai, served as a useful adjuvant to chemotherapy by improving
efficacy [18].
Similarly, other studies have demonstrated the benefits of CAM therapy in mitigating the adverse
effects of chemotherapy, including myalgia and diarrhea [19,20].
[21].
In the last few years there has been more research devoted to CAM.
However, there still remain many obstacles for CAM to be integrated into cancer treatment,
for the potentially high demand.
The technology required for plant extraction and mixture preparation is another hurdle in

Unfortu- nately, this medication is difficult to use since the LD-50 (potentially fatal dose) is
quite close to the therapeutic dose.
In the years leading up to the 1970’s, rapidly acting barbiturates were commonly utilized for their
hypnotic effects.
Unfortunately, these medications, also drugs of abuse, had a significant danger of overdose and
contrib- uted to an era that was characterized in part by deaths due to overdoses of sleeping pills.
Glutethimide (Doriden), Ethchlor- vynol (Placidyl), Methyprylon (Nodudar)] have limited availability
and are rarely used due to limited efficacy, cognitive effects, the potential for abuse and lethal
tox- icity associated with overdose (Oswald 1970).
Today their primary therapeutic uses include executions and fa- cilitated euthanasia (Lossignol

While all hypnotics have abuse potential for individuals with addictive histories and personalities,
these agents have been noted to have min- imal additive potential (Hajak et al.

The difference in values is probably attributable to lower rates of radiation treatment and a higher
use of hormonal treatment in the Lazzaro study, in which.
Total 5-year costs, including costs of both diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer, is reported

Discrepancies between the two studies may arise through differences in the estimations of individual
treatment costs, the proportions of patients receiving each type of therapy, or a combination of
both.
Results from three sources presenting cost data for prostate cancer in the USA are shown in Table 1
of care data [ 12 ] .
The NCI estimate for expenditure on prostate cancer treatment in 2006 was $9.862 billion, and
average Medicare payments per patient in the fi rst year after diagnosis were $11 000.
It should be noted when interpreting this data that use of PSA testing for prostate cancer is more
widespread in the USA than in many other countries, thus increasing the number of cases identifi ed.
related illnesses and death lead to losses in economic productivity.
Recent analyses of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)- Medicare database tracked
healthcare use and costs (projected to 2004 levels) from diagnosis and initial treatment [ 15 ] , in
addition to a 4-year follow-up [ 17 ] , for a cohort of 81 659 elderly patients with prostate cancer
who had Medicare claims from 1991 to 2003 [ 15 ] , and 1991 to 2004 [ 17 ] , respectively.
Treatment in the fi rst year after diagnosis was calculated to incur costs of $21 040 per patient;
$13 091 for prostate cancer-related costs and $7949 for medical costs unrelated to prostate cancer [
15 ] .
15,17 ] .
Prostate cancer-related costs over 4 years from diagnosis averaged $18 168 per patient [ 17 ] .
The annual healthcare cost burden estimated in 2009 is > $2.5 billion annually for initial care
alone [ 17 ] .
A recent analysis of US managed care data revealed similar costs for initial therapy in men with
prostate cancer [ 18 ] .
During the fi rst 2 years after diagnosis, the average total cost across all patients was $48 808,
with $29 417 representing prostate cancer-related costs.
Those patients receiving treatment incurred costs fi ve times higher than those undergoing watchful
waiting ($38 945 vs $7595).
The highest costs were incurred within the fi rst 3 months after diagnosis and decreased

dependently against the prescriber’s orders by at least two individuals who are trained and
competent to administer chemotherapy medications.
All dosage- and administration- rate-related calculations should be independently verified.
This includes any infusion pump rate settings, which should be checked at the initiation of each

care for the patient.
Healthcare providers should routinely confirm that the medication will be admin- istered to the

In conclusion, metformin treatment in combi- nation with suboptimal dosage of conventional
antimalarials is more efficacious in reducing parasite load.
Metformin is listed by the World Health Organization as an essential medicine to treat and prevent
As a biguanide, metformin is related to guanidine and galegine, which can both be extracted from
goat’s rue (Galega officionalis).
Metformin was first synthesized in 1922, but its use as an antidiabetic agent was only proposed in
1957, a discovery closely linked to malaria owing to the structural relatedness of metformin to
proguanil, a highly potent antimalarial biguanide.

outperforms with minimal lactic acidosis.
In addition, metformin is water-soluble, is orally bioavail- able, has excellent pharmacokinetic
adsorption and excretion properties, and has a low cost of production, making it highly affordable
and accessible (37, 38).
These properties contribute to metformin’s qualifications as an optimal drug for repurposing (39).
Interest in metformin repurposing has been sparked in recent years because of numerous epidemiologic
observations and meta-analyses demonstrating positive outcomes and improved prognosis in diabetes
patients diagnosed with cancer.

The mechanism of action of metformin is not fully defined because it appears to have multiple pleio-

This leads to a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation and subsequent drop in energy with altered

AMPK-dependent processes that are altered include suppression of mTOR and insulin receptor signaling

marginally improved parasitological clearance (compared with SP alone).
The studies reviewed were mostly done in areas and at times when both SP and chloroquine/amodi-

combination would act in areas where one of the components was significantly compromised.

However, as discussed in the text, this may be an underestimate, since it does not include
additional risk because of the change in endpoints between parasite reduction in phase IIa (APCR on
day 14 or 28) and ACPR day 28 in phase IIb.

Parasitemia is determined microscopically by counting 4 fields of approximately 100 erythrocytes per
For low parasitemias (<1%), up to 4000 erythrocytes have to be counted.
Alternatively the parasitemia can also be determined by FACS analysis, which works particularly well
for parasitemias >1%.

Compounds showing good in vivo activity in the primary 4-day suppressive test should be evaluated
further in secondary in vivo models (Supplemental Box 1).
Mice, maintenance, drug preparation and application, and assessment of parasitemia are the same as

In this paper, we describe a novel feature space designed to effectively classify the polarity and
strength of relationships extracted from biomedical abstracts.
These features are constructed at three different levels: entity, phrase, and sentence.
A wrapper-based method is then used to select the optimal feature sets for both polarity and
strength prediction.
Specifically, a multi-stage SVM classifier and an SVR predictor are built for polarity and strength

The main reason is that it might just add redundant or even incorrect information for creating
semantic structures due to limitations in the current co-reference identification module.

The main reason being that more than 50% of the unigrams formed using the neighborhood have a term

For instance, the sentence “Soy consumption significantly reduces the risk of cancer.” has a strong
strength.
The word “significantly” carries the most weight for the SVR model to make the correct prediction.
Finally, we notice that the medium strength achieves the highest accuracy as against.
In this method, we first build a SVM to separate positive relationships from negative, neutral and
no-relationship.
Such an ordering is chosen on the basis of both manual observations and empirical evaluation.
Here we build a SVM to separate neutral and no-relationships first from positive and negative ones.
We then build two other SVMs to separate between neutral and no-relationship and between positive
and negative relationships, respectively.
The above combination strategy is based on analyses of our dataset, which shows that positive and
negative relationships often exhibit similar characteristics when compared against the other two
types.
For strength analysis we build the SVRs using the entire training set without categorizing the

From Table 6, one can observe that the positive polarity constantly has high accuracy for both
methods as compared to the other polarities.
One main reason we believe is that the annotated corpus has a large number of positive examples as
shown in Table 4.

Therefore unigrams alone are often sufficient.
The accuracy of neutral relationships is low because neutral and positive relationships tend to
What is the purpose of a RA and what makes it a good one, and who decides that it is a good RA.
Are there rules for easier writing.
If the main function of a RA is to transfer a new knowledge on a research topic, then a good paper
is the one that is clear, coherent, focused, well argued and uses language that does not have
ambiguous or equivoque meaning.
However, it is not only the message that is important.
The RA must have a well-defined structure and function in serve like a cook-book, so the others can

Also Funkhouser and Maccoby (1971) showed that the information gain is especially enhanced by the
“use of examples", i.e.
it helps a lot to use some non-science material, such as everyday life parallels, historical points,
etc.
On the other hand, some sections, such as Introduction and Discussion, have to intrigue readers and
attract interest and should therefore not be over-simplified.

It is approximated that from all published journal RAs in the world, only less than 5% are read in

Abstract: Biomedical Informatics can be defined as “the interdisciplinary field that studies and
problem solving, and decision making, motivated by efforts to improve human health.” However,

identify, extract and understand information out of this data, it is obvious that an
application of these methods to weakly structured complex medical data sets.
The aim is to support end users to learn how to interactively analyse information properties and to
smarter decision making.
Data exploration has recently been hailed as the fourth paradigm in the investigation of nature,
after empiricism, theory and computation (Bell, Hey & Szalay, 2009).
Whether in astronomy or the life sciences, the flood of data requires sophisticated methods of
handling.
For example, researchers in bioinformatics collect, process and analyze masses of data, or in
computational biology, they simulate biological systems, metabolic pathways, the behavior of a cell
or how a protein is built (Hey, Tansley & Tolle, 2009).
In clinical medicine, the end users are confronted with increased volumes of highly complex, noisy,
high-dimensional, multivariate and often weakly- structured data (Holzinger, 2011c).
making which is still a central topic in biomedical informatics (Shortliffe, 2011).
Whereas Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) concentrates on human intelligence, and Knowledge Discovery
in Data Mining (KDD) concentrates on machine intelligence, the grand challenge is to combine these
diverse fields to support the expert end users in learning to interactively analyze information

All essential documents of the patient records contain a certain portion of data which has been

A typi- cal researcher will likely spend hundreds of hours every year reading papers.
The key idea is that you should read the paper in up to three passes, instead of starting at the
beginning and plow- ing your way to the end.
The third pass helps you understand the paper in depth.

(100 mm) thick brick and 3 in.  (75 mm) for use with nominal 3 in.  (75 mm) thick brick.
Steel angle lintels should have a space at their ends to permit thermal expansion.

The shape and depth of the combustion chamber will greatly influence draft, combustion air
Figure 1 illustrates the shape and Table 1 provides recommended dimensions for the combustion
Significant changes should not be made without consulting a fireplace design consultant.
The sides and lower portion of the back of the combustion chamber should be vertical.
Above the vertical portion of the back, the brick should be sloped forward towards the fireplace
opening to support the metal damper and the clay flue lining.
For the maximum amount of reflected heat into the room, the sloped portion of the back should be
If it is concave, more heat will be reflected back into the fire rather than into the room.
The combustion chamber should be constructed of nominal 4 in.  (100 mm) thick brick.
When refractory brick or firebrick are used, model building codes permit the total wall thickness to
be reduced.
Thin mortar joints, not more than 1/4 in.(6.4 mm), should be specified.  A 1 in.

This provides greater heating efficiency.
Careful consideration should be given to size of the fireplace opening best suited for the room in
If the fireplace opening is too small, it may function properly but will not produce enough heat to
warm the room.
In such a case, the firebox opening would require a larger flue area and consume larger amounts of
sizes.
For example, a room with 300 ft2 (28 m2) of floor area is best served by a fireplace with an opening

Brick arches usually require no steel reinforcement and are an attractive option.
When determining the height of a fireplace opening which incorporates an arch use the maximum height
to the arch soffit.
Information on arch design may be found in Technical Notes 31 Series.
Reinforced brick masonry (RBM) lintels may be built in place or prefabricated.
The advantages of using RBM lintels are numerous, but include more efficient use of materials and
Loose steel angle lintels are the most prevalent means of support.
For this reason, Table 1 gives recommended steel angle dimensions.
If opening sizes other than those listed in Table 1 are used, information found in Technical Notes
31B Revised can be used for design of the loose steel angle lintel.

Resistance to transmission of sound in masonry construction is accomplished in two ways: the use of
heavy massive walls or the use of discontinuous construction.
The cavity wall employs both techniques, i.e., the massiveness of the two masonry wythes plus the
partial discontinuity of the cavity.
Because of the separation and cushioning effect of the air space and the massiveness of the masonry,
(250 mm) brick cavity wall with brick backing has a Sound Transmission Class (STC) rating of 50,
which is usually sufficient for substantially reducing typical outside noises entering the building
through the wall.
For more information on sound transmission, see Technical Notes 5A.
Both rational and empirical design methods are used.
Limit states or strength design methods are now being written.
of cracked panels have been proposed for the design of unreinforced walls.
However, insufficient data and lack of recognition by model building codes relegate these methods to
The structural design of cavity walls should follow either rational or empirical methods.
The rational design method is based on the properties of the wall materials and engineering
analysis.
This method may be used for any structure where high loads are likely or where tall walls are a
construction with limited floor spans and wall heights; and for multistory buildings where
The design of cavity walls is governed by model building codes.
Most of these reference the ACI 530/ASCE 5/TMS 402 Building Code Requirements for Masonry
Structures, also known as the Masonry Standards Joint Committee (MSJC) Code [2].
The Uniform Building Code incorporates similar design requirements for cavity walls [9].
Seismic design requirements are also stipulated in these building codes based on site location.
A detailed design of cavity walls is not covered in this Technical Notes.

corresponding flue liner size, L and M.
Using Equation 1 calculate the Fireplace Opening Area, A o.
From Table 1 determine the Minimum Flue Area, A F, using L and M.
Based on the size of the flue selected, a preliminary damper size must be assumed.
Once this decision has been made the Inlet Loss Coefficient, K 2, may be determined.
If the damper throat area is equal to the flue area, K 2 is equal to 2.5.
If the damper throat is twice the flue area, K 2 is equal to 1.0.
If no rain cap is used K 3 equals 0.0.
If a rain cap is set at a distance of D/2 (see Table 1 for equivalent diameter, D) above the
termination point of the flue liner, K 3 may vary from 0.0 to 4.0.
This information may be obtained from the manufacturer.

Wind turbines will be used to harness the kinetic energy of the moving air over the oceans on the
OCS and convert it to electricity.
Offshore winds are less turbulent (because the ocean is flat relative to onshore topography), and
they tend to flow at higher speeds than onshore winds, thus allowing turbines to produce more
electricity.
Because the potential energy produced from the wind is directly proportional to the cube of the wind
speed, increased wind speeds of only a few miles per hour can produce a significantly larger amount
For instance, a turbine at a site with an average wind speed of 16 mph would produce 50% more
electricity than at a site with the same turbine and average wind speeds of 14 mph (Offshore Wind

As early as 200 B.C., wind was reportedly used to pump water in China and grind grain in the Middle
East.
Over the centuries, onshore wind has been harnessed to generate power worldwide.
homes and pump water for consumption and crop irrigation; industrialization sparked the development
of larger windmills to generate electricity for commercial purposes.
Interest in wind energy has waxed and waned with the price of fossil fuels.
After the 1973 Arab oil embargo, new ways of converting wind energy into useful power were
developed.
Many of these approaches have been demonstrated in wind facilities (also known as wind farms, wind
power plants, or wind projects), which are groups of turbines that feed electricity into the utility
wind-generated electricity is close to that generated from conventional utilities in some locations.
Wind energy is the fastest growing energy source worldwide at about 20 to 30% per year.
The worldwide installed capacity of onshore grid-connected wind power is about 40 GW.
Turbine sizes have increased over the past two decades.

In addition to the VIX Index, Cboe calculates several other broad market volatility indexes
including the Cboe Short- Term Volatility Index (VIX9DSM), which reflects 9-day expected volatility
of the S&P 500 Index, the Cboe S&P 500® 3-Month Volatility Index (VIX3MSM), Cboe S&P 500® 6-Month

Precast hollow-core concrete planks generally bear on the interior wythe of a cavity wall.
The plank rests a minimum of 3 in.

(LECOM) and the national Student Osteopathic Medical Association (SOMA) president.
For instance, the analysis did not take into con- sideration how applicants ranked specialties,
whether or not they matched into their top choice of specialty, mul- tiple match attempts,
apart from the AOA and NRMP that matches applicants to a few highly competitive specialties,
including neurology, oph- thalmology, and plastic surgery.

SINCE 2001, ALL state licensing boards have accepted the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensure
Osteopathic Medical Examiners (NBOME).
The United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE), produced by the National Board of Med- ical
must be passed for a phy- sician to gain unlimited licensure to practice medicine in the United
States.
According to 2013 USMLE Performance Data pub- lished in the 2013 NBME Annual Report, 97 percent of
MD students (N=19,108), 94 percent of DO students (N=2,680), and 79 percent of foreign medical
students and gradu- ates (N=14,649) passed the USMLE Step 1 exam on their first attempt.
Osteopathic medical students may elect to take the USMLE based on a variety of reasons, including

Even with high coincident and/or concurrent use, there is no evidence in the population of producing

The six responders had a baseline average of 6.3 points, so there was room for improvement.

To further illustrate the possible association between stronger price regulations and lower medicine
prices, an analysis was undertaken to compare the real price indices for pharmaceuticals in
Australia and the USA from 1981 to 2017.
This index indicates the change in price level for pharmaceuticals relative to the change in price

prices of pharmaceuticals grew faster than the collective prices of all goods and services (Fig.

However, the trends in the two countries began to diverge in the late 1980s where the price level of
medicines continued to rise faster in the USA, while the growth rate of pharmaceutical prices in
Australia seemed to have been stabilized at around 10% higher than the consumer price index.
This could possibly be due to the introduction of “cost effectiveness” as a requirement before
listing a medicine on the national pharmaceutical insurance scheme, so as to ensure the benefits of
The divergence became more prominent when the Australian Government undertook further reforms of its
national scheme after 2005 (247), which was implemented in response to a report that warned “in 40

In contrast, medicine prices continued to grow considerably in the USA, with the cumulative growth

In addition to providing direct contribution towards the discovery of medical research, governments
in many countries have also implemented a range of indirect measures to incentivize R&D.

In summary, public and non-profit-making sectors, and by extension tax-payers and philanthropists,
have provided considerable financial and non-financial contributions towards the R&D of cancer
medicines.
The pharmaceutical industry has also benefited greatly from the knowledge generated by public-sector
Considering these facts, some stakeholders have questioned whether pharmaceutical companies could

The implications of the significant dispersion of prices are at least threefold.
Firstly, it indicates that existing procurement practices in some countries may not be the most
Secondly, it may impair the countries’ coverage of essential cancer medicines when prices are higher
than their ability to fund and provide the medicines.
This would, in turn, have a negative impact on patients' timely access to medicines and their
Thirdly, regional price differences within a country may cause inequitable access, with only some
patients having access to the medicines at lower prices.

expenditure on these medicines would be within the generously assumed 5% of the total health
expenditure (Table 4.2).
In high- income countries, the analysis found that a budget threshold of 5% of the total health
expenditure would allow a spending of up to US$ 40 600 on cancer medicines per patient per year,

Typically, this means that the regulator needs to have full visibility of the supply and
The regulator also needs to have the capacity and ability to enforce non-compliance.
Profit control is most effective when there is a publicly- funded universal programme for the
provision of medicines.
In contrast, it may be much less effective in health care settings where the private sector plays a
significant role in the delivery of medicines, or where the structure of supply chain is complex or
Some countries may place limits on the frequency and magnitude of price increments, or even impose a
price freeze or price reduction (161,184).
In the latter, pharmaceutical prices cannot be raised for a predetermined period of time unless
there is a justification.

Studies of international regulations of drug prices and the Gant Consortium’s own analysis of the

American payers have typically been reticent to say no to covering drugs, and MEAs are built on the
The technical complexity of MEAs present additional implementation barriers; for example, the
administrative burdens and complexity of collecting data and managing agreements with different
manufacturers are considerable.
Should MEAs be adopted more widely by private insurers, the discounted prices are likely to remain
confidential.
Finally, MEAs do not resolve underlying controversies regarding appropriate comparator drugs,
measures of clinical efficacy, or how to build in other patient considerations.

III.
Sleep-Wake Schedule: In evaluating sleep-related symptoms, the clinician must consider not only the
time to fall asleep (sleep latency), number of awakenings, wake time after sleep onset (WASO), sleep
duration, and napping can be quantified retrospectively during the clinical assessment and
prospectively with sleep-wake logs.

Disorder                                         Description
Adjustment   (Acute) Insomnia                    The  essential feature of this disorder is the presence of insomnia in association with an iden-
tifiable stressor, such as psychosocial,  physical, or environmental   disturbances. The  sleep
disturbance  has a relatively short duration (days-weeks)  and is expected to resolve when  the
stressor resolves.
Psychophysiological  Insomnia                    The  essential features of this disorder are heightened arousal and learned sleep-preventing as-
sociations. Arousal may  be physiological, cognitive, or emotional, and characterized by muscle
tension, “racing thoughts,” or heightened  awareness  of the environment.  Individuals typically
have  increased concern  about sleep difficulties and their consequences, leading to a “vicious
cycle” of arousal, poor sleep, and frustration.
Paradoxical  Insomnia                            The  essential feature of this disorder is a complaint of severe or nearly “total” insomnia that
greatly exceeds  objective evidence  of sleep disturbance and is not commensurate   with the re-
ported  degree of daytime  deficit. Although paradoxical insomnia  is best diagnosed  with con-
current PSG   and  self-reports, it can be presumptively diagnosed  on  clinical grounds alone.
To  some  extent, “misperception”   of the severity of sleep disturbance  may   characterize all
insomnia  disorders.
Idiopathic Insomnia                              The  essential feature of this disorder is a persistent complaint of insomnia with insidious on-
set during infancy  or early childhood and no  or few extended  periods of sustained remission.
Idiopathic insomnia  is not associated with specific precipitating or perpetuating factors.
Insomnia  Due  to Mental  Disorder               The  essential feature of this disorder is the occurrence of insomnia   that occurs exclusively
during  the course of a mental disorder, and is judged to be caused by that disorder. The insom-
nia is of sufficient severity to cause distress or to require separate treatment. This diagnosis is
not used  to explain insomnia that has a course independent  of the associated mental  disorder,
as is not routinely made   in individuals with the “usual”  severity of sleep symptoms   for an
associated  mental disorder.
Inadequate  Sleep Hygiene                        The  essential feature of this disorder is insomnia associated with voluntary sleep practices or
activities that are inconsistent with good sleep quality and daytime alertness. These practices
and  activities typically produce increased  arousal or directly interfere with sleep, and may
include  irregular sleep scheduling, use of alcohol, caffeine, or nicotine, or engaging in non-
sleep behaviors  in the sleep environment. Some  element  of poor sleep hygiene may  character-
ize individuals with other insomnia  disorders.
Insomnia  Due  to a Drug or Substance            The  essential feature of this disorder is sleep disruption due to use of a prescription medica-
tion, recreational drug, caffeine, alcohol, food, or environmental  toxin. Insomnia  may  occur
during  periods of use/exposure,  or during discontinuation.  When   the identified substance is
stopped,  and after discontinuation effects subside, the insomnia is expected to resolve or sub-
stantially improve.
Insomnia  Due  to Medical  Condition             The  essential feature of this disorder is insomnia  caused  by a  coexisting medical  disorder
or other physiological  factor. Although  insomnia  is commonly   associated  with many  medi-
cal conditions, this diagnosis  should be used  when  the insomnia   causes marked   distress or
warrants  separate clinical attention. This diagnosis is not used to explain insomnia that has a
course  independent  of the associated medical disorder, and is not routinely made in individu-
als with the “usual” severity of sleep symptoms   for an associated medical  disorder.
Insomnia  Not  Due  to Substance or Known        These  two  diagnoses are used  for insomnia disorders that cannot be classified elsewhere  but

Rapid identification of CP-CRAB and immediate implementation of infection control measures are key
to controlling transmission in health care facilities.
The case definition for reporting includes CRAB isolated from any body site that is resistant to any
carbapenem based on current Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines, or that
demonstrates the presence or production of a carbapenemase, if such testing is done.
Statewide surveillance for CRAB will include the submission of isolates to the MDH-PHL for further
characterization, the submission of susceptibility and other specimen test results, and demographic
and clinical case report information.
