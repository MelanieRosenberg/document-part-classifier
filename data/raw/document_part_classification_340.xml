For inferential statistics and selecting proper tests, we have studied the normality of data. Data was normal and then one-sample sign test is used at level 0.05. As it is shown in Table 4, the results of this test indicated that the students of different strands (mathematics, experimental science and humanities) could understand the relation between mathematics and real-life for second and third parts of questionnaire (items for perceptions about importance of mathematical connections and for perceptions about the
