The rising cost of health care (Saxe et al., 2008), coupled with multiple unmet needs, equates to multiple CAM uses (Mao et al., 2008). These unmet needs were identified by Mao et al. (2008) as emotional, physical, nutritional, financial, informational, treatment- and employment-related, and daily living activi- ties. Other reasons included an identified dissatisfaction with conventional care (Richardson et al., 2000; Saxe et al., 2008), fragmentation of care into survivorship, lack of empathy and support, or if a survivor’s subsequent needs were unfulfilled (Mao et al., 2008). In addition, Carpenter et al. (2008) identi- fied decreased emotional function and multiple medical issues in very long-term breast cancer survivors who used CAM. The potential for recurrence and high levels of worry (Mao et al., 2008) and distress (Lawsin et al., 2007) also were reported with increased use. Finally, the use of herbal supplements were reportedly used to reduce the side effects of treatment and to boost immune function (Buettner et al., 2006; Deng et al., 2004; Lawsin et al., 2007; Richardson et al., 2000; Saxe et al., 2008).

To provide quality care to the cancer survivor, oncology nurses should understand the characteristics and reasons for CAM use and examine personal views and beliefs regarding CAM. Once personal biases and beliefs have been identified, the nurse can explore reasons for looking into the use of these therapies with the patient. Nurses should approach CAM with a non-judgmental attitude (Saxe et al., 2008) to avoid non-report- ing of CAM use by the patient. Saxe et al. (2008) and Frenkel et al. (2005) reported that patients often do not report the use of CAM primarily because of the healthcare provider’s negative attitudes or limited knowledge regarding their use. Addition- ally, the patient or survivor may choose only to disclose one of multiple CAM therapies that they are using (Saxe et al., 2008). Robinson and McGrail (2004) reported that disclosure rates of CAM use ranged from 23%–90%. Chen, Bernard, and Cottrell (1999) demonstrated lower reporting to physicians who did not practice some form of CAM (67%) versus those who did (90%). Disclosure remains important to consider because patients who are seeing CAM providers and subsequently engaging in CAM treatments in addition to conventional care may cause interrup- tion in their treatment and potential harm to themselves (Saxe et al., 2008). Cultural sensitivity also is essential for understanding CAM use. Cultural beliefs are important in the acceptance of, or mistrust with, conventional health care. This can lead to subse- quent rejection of Western health care (Mao et al., 2008). Nursing assessment should focus on psychological processes of the patient (Gansler et al., 2008), including fear, quality of life, and spiritual values, as well as feelings of hope, optimism, and personal control (Richardson et al., 2000) (see Table 2). An evaluation of common characteristics may assist the pro- vider in identification of increased use. An example of this is that supplement use has been reported to be associated with survivors with increased exercise and dietary changes that in- cluded increased fruit and vegetable intake (Gunther, Patterson, Kristal, Stratton, & White, 2004; Miller et al., 2008). Preliminary assessment also should include factors such as financial concerns related to care, cancer type, stage, prognosis,

and end-of-life issues, because diagnoses such as breast cancer are associated with increased CAM use in conjunction with con- ventional treatment (Deng et al., 2004; Mao et al., 2008). Nurses need to possess a good understanding of the survivor’s motiva- tion surrounding the use of CAM. Addressing unmet needs, side-effect management, and conducting an evaluation of the patient’s understanding of safety in these therapies is imperative in future survivor care. Because CAM use is more likely related to symptom treatment, such as pain, fatigue, and hot flashes (Mao et al., 2008), a thorough focus on side-effect management also is an essential component of survivorship.
