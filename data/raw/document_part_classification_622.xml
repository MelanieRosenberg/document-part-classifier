<TEXT>
I understand that this Direct Rollover to the Florida Retirement System (FRS) is for the express purpose of purchasing service credit under the FRS. Furthermore, I understand that I will not earn interest on my personal contributions (including these rollover funds) in the FRS. I certify that I am not rolling over any of my required minimum distribution amount from my current account. I understand that to avoid the interest, this payment must be received by the FRS no later than June 30.
