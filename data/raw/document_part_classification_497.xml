• All full- and part-time students, whether living on campus, or off campus must register their vehicle with the college within 24 hours of their arrival to Luther. • The college vehicle registration fee is $220.00 per academic year for students living on campus, and $190.00 for commuters. Temporary parking permits are available for $2.00 per day. Limited “Reduced lot” permits are available for $120.00, inquire at the Welcome/Information Center in the Union; some restrictions apply. • A student parking sticker entitles a registered vehicle to be parked in a designated student or general parking area, according to permit, if and when there is a parking space available; it does not guarantee a parking space.
