□ New Authorization: I hereby authorize the Virginia Housing Development Authority (VHDA) to deposit into my account any and all housing assistance payments payable by VHDA to me under the Housing Choice Voucher Program and to correct entries for such deposits hereafter made in such account. This authority will remain in force until I have submitted a written revocation to VHDA, which revocation shall be in such form and shall be submitted prior to such date as VHDA shall require. I understand that VHDA reserves the right to make such payments to me by check rather than by direct deposit.
