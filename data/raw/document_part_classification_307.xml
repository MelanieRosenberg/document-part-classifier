warming or internet commerce” and the need for social and natural scientists to “forget about what separates them and start looking at those ‘things’ whose hybrid nature has, for many dec- ades now, already unified them in practice.” Arguably, the economic nature of human activity (represented by lines representing different streams of literature in Figure 1) has changed substan- tively on account of two revolutions in work practice, namely, the industrial and knowledge revo- lutions, which enabled radically enhanced productivity improvements and a sea change in social theory in their wake. It is suggested here that societal, business, and biomedical ethics are not in- dependent of these changes, and that the post-industrial paradigm, with its ethics premised on social theory developed in response to industrialisation, has been disrupted by a further productiv- ity revolution which has increased the returns to knowledge in production, and that divergence has occurred between ethical thought premised on industrialised logics and a new ethics based on exponential increases in the power of knowledge to generate social and scientific change.

The emergence of new forms of enterprise, discussed earlier in reference to sale of human tissues, and new forms of biotechnology, such as genetic engineering, are simply examples of this diver- gence, which arguably requires new thinking around how to radically increase transparency and accountability, as emergent technologies enable not only radically improved potential for innova- tion but also increasing connectivity between human stakeholders who are directly affected by these developments. This divergence arguably places bioethicists, and education and profession- alization of bioethics (White et al., 2014) at the forefront of strategic response to radical advances in biomedicine to come. However, given the uncertainty of ‘wicked’ problems (Rittel & Webber, 1973) related to complexity of human values negotiation over increasingly beneficial and hazard- ous potentialities, the last line of ethical resource might be the democratic population itself.
