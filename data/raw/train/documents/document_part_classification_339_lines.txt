The findings of Table 6 have shown that students of humanities strand have more frequency percent
(45.3% for "no answer") than other strands in first category (quality of examples) for second
open-ended question.
It can conclude that students have demonstrated real-life category often in three strands.
Mathematics is a main matter of the real-life that can cover all aspects of real world.
Therefore educational systems have to create new circumferences for mathematics education.
The results of this study have indicated that all students of this research have understood the
importance and frequency of the relation of mathematics to real-life.
But students of humanities strand believed that it is not considered the relation of mathematics to
real-life in teaching mathematics and also students of experimental science strand believed that it
cannot create the relation between taught mathematical subjects and real-life.
