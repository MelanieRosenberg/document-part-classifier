The analysis found that low-income countries could spend on average up to US$ 3800 per cancer
patient annually on cancer medicines for all newly-diagnosed cancer patients, and the total
expenditure on these medicines would be within the generously assumed 5% of the total health
expenditure (Table 4.2).
In high- income countries, the analysis found that a budget threshold of 5% of the total health
expenditure would allow a spending of up to US$ 40 600 on cancer medicines per patient per year,
with a view to providing universal coverage.

For question (b), Table 4.3 (p.78) shows the estimated annual costs of standard treatment regimens
for a select set of cancers, calculated based on the dosages recommended in clinical guidelines and
the prices of cancer medicines in India, South Africa, Australia and the USA.
These countries were selected to illustrate prices of medicines in countries of different economies
and with different levels of price regulations.
The analysis found that the estimated treatment costs frequently exceeded the per-patient annual
"budgets" estimated in question (a), despite the generous assumptions of 1% to 5% of total health
budget being spent.
on cancer medicines (alone).
For example, the treatment cost for one patient with chronic myeloid leukaemia for a year would be
between US$ 800 and US$ 96 700 for imatinib and US$ 800 to US$ 109 400 for dasatinib, which are
higher than the per-person budget of US$ 800 to US$ 40 600 estimated in Table 4.2.
The unaffordability was even more prominent when considering the standard treatment regimen for
early stage HER2- positive breast cancer, where the estimated costs ranged between US$ 18 500 and
US$ 71 000.
These examples suggest that, at current prices, universal coverage of cancer medicines (alone) will
greatly exceed 5% of total expenditure on health care.
This is unaffordable and unsustainable.
