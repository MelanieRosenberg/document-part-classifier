If your child develops any of these symptoms, please notify his/her school and contact your child’s
doctor for evaluation and testing for COVID-19 infection.
Parents often have questions about testing their child after an exposure.
Testing is recommended if symptoms are present, but not recommended without symptoms.
A negative test does not release a student from quarantine or allow a return to in-person
instruction.
If parents want to test their child in the absence of symptoms, we encourage waiting until seven
days after exposure.
If their child has a negative result; the student will still need to quarantine 14 days from last
exposure.
This is because it could take up to 14 days for symptoms to appear.
Having your child in quarantine does not require any restrictions with other household members
unless your child is experiencing COVID-19 symptoms or has tested positive for COVID-19.
If your child develops symptoms or tests positive, household members should also quarantine and
await further instruction from public health.
