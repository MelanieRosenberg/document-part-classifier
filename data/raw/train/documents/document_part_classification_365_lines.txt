*Joint involvement refers to any swollen or tender joint on examina- tion.
Distal interphalangeal joints, first carpometacarpal joints, and first metatarsophalangeal joints
are excluded from assessment.
Catego- ries of joint distribution are classified according to the location and
numberoftheinvolvedjoints,withplacementintothehighestcategory possible based on the pattern of joint
involvement.
“Large joints” refers to shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and ankles.
“Small joints” refers to the metacarpophalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal joints, second
through fifth metatarsophalangeal joints, thumb inter- phalangeal joints, and wrists.
“Symmetric” is defined as bilateral involvement of at least 1 region.
In the category “(cid:5)10 joints,” at least 1 of the involved joints must be a small joint; the
other joints can include any combination of large and additional small joints, as well as other
joints not specifically listed elsewhere (e.g., temporomandibular, acromioclavicular,
sternoclavicular, etc.).
†Negative refers to IU values that are less than or equal to the upper
limitofnormal(ULN)forthelaboratoryandassay;low-positiverefers to IU values that are higher than the
ULN but (cid:3)3 times the ULN for the laboratory and assay; high-positive refers to IU values that
are (cid:5)3 times the ULN for the laboratory and assay.
Where rheumatoid factor (RF) information is only available as positive or negative, a positive
result should be scored as low-positive for RF.
ACPA (cid:2) anti(cid:3)citrullinated protein antibody.
‡ Normal/abnormal is determined by local laboratory standards.
CRP (cid:2) C-reactive protein; ESR (cid:2) erythrocyte sedimentation rate.
§Duration of symptoms refers to patient self-report of the duration of signs or symptoms of
synovitis (e.g., pain, swelling, tenderness) of joints that are clinically involved at the time of
assessment, regardless of treatment status.
rules for the classification of such patients, it is appro- priate to have a single criteria system
that could be applied to all patients; these issues were addressed by the expert panel during Phase
3.
Determination of the optimal cut point for defi- nite rheumatoid arthritis.
Determination of the optimal cut point to classify an individual as having definite RA.
was achieved using 2 complementary approaches, mir- roring the approaches used in the first 2
phases: data- informed and consensus-based.
From the consensus- based approach, the expert panel was asked to examine the rankings of case
scenarios based on the new scoring system and to indicate, in their opinion, the point at which the
cases changed from “probable” to “definite” RA.
Four cases were excluded due to missing domain information (n (cid:2) 2) or ineligibility (2 cases
were more likely another diagnosis).
For the remaining 50 cases, the mean cut point defining definite RA was 65.7 (median 66.1; range
60.0–70.3) of a total possible score of 100.
A data-driven verification of that cut point was then attempted, in which the new scoring system was
applied to 3 of the existing cohorts used for Phase 1 (the Etude et Suivi des Polyarthrites
Indifferenciees Re- centes data set from France, the Norwegian data set, and the Rotterdam Early
Arthritis Cohort data set from Rotterdam) (25).
These cohorts were chosen based on the completeness of data and the collected variables, enabling
calculation of the patients’ probability scores at baseline.
The disease characteristics of these cohorts were not substantively different from those of the re-
maining cohorts (data not shown).
The area under the curve (AUC) for the 3 receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (which plot
sensitivity against 1 (cid:3) specificity for the range of scores) indicated good discrimination of
those who did versus those who did not receive MTX (or another DMARD/biologic agent) within a year
(AUC 0.82 for Norway, 0.66 for France, and AUC 0.69 for Rotterdam; P (cid:4) 0.0001 for all).
The probability scores similarly discriminated between those who fulfilled the 1987 ACR criteria at
12 months and those who did not (AUC for the ROC curves 0.88 [Norway], 0.67 [France], and 0.72
[Rotterdam]).
Visual inspection of the diagnostic test parameters associated with curves that used MTX initi-
ation as the outcome showed a maximum slope for both the positive and negative likelihood ratios
between a score of 60/100 and 70/100, with flattening thereafter (67 in the Norway cohort, 66 in the
French cohort, and 66 in the Rotterdam cohort).
The cut point of 60–70 that was derived from expert consensus was therefore supported by these data.
Given the consistency with the consensus- based approach, and to maximize sensitivity of the
criteria, a cut point of 60 was deemed to be most appropriate.
Rationale for the composition and weight of the final criteria.
For development of the final criteria set, the results and weights from the comprehensive Phase 2
process (26) were used as a starting point.
