3H-hypoxanthine (which is taken up by the parasite for purine salvage and DNA synthesis) to
determine the level ofP.falciparum growth inhibition.In most applica- tions,parasites are cultured
in the presence ofdifferent concentrations of test compound in media containing reduced
concentrations of hypoxanthine,after which 3H-hypoxanthine is added for an additional incuba- tion
period before cell harvesting and measurement of radioactive counts.
IC 50values can be determined by linear regression analyses on the linear segments of the
dose–response curves.
Although 3H-hypoxanthine incorporation is the most commonly used method to assay antimalarial
activity in vitro,it is costly,radioactive and quite com- plex,and therefore problematic for
resource-poor loca- tions or for high-throughput screening (HTS,reviewed in REF.
51).
A low-cost alternative for testing small numbers ofcompounds is to incubate parasites with test
compounds (typically for 48 or 72 hours),and then to compare parasitaemias oftreated and control
parasites by counting GIEMSA-stained parasites by light microscopy.
Another established,but less standardized,assay involves the colorimetric detection of lactate
dehydrogenase52.
Flow cytometry has also been used to test candidate anti- malarial compounds,and takes advantage
ofthe fact that human erythrocytes lack DNA.In the simplest use ofthis technology, parasites are
fixed after the appropriate period ofincubation with test compounds,then either the parasitized
cells are stained with hydroethidine (which is metabolized to ethidium53) or the parasite nuclei are
stained with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2- phenylindole).Counts oftreated and control cultures are then
obtained by flow cytometry.Appropriate gating can.
also allow one to distinguish different parasite erythro- cytic stages.This relatively simple assay
provides quite high throughput and has replaced older methods at some centres,but requires expensive
equipment.
Compounds that meet an acceptable cut-off for in vitroactivity (for example,IC 50≤1 µM) can then be
tested for activity against a range ofgeographically dis- tinct P.falciparum lines of differing
drug-resistance phenotypes (see Further Information,Antimalarial drug discovery:efficacy models for
compound screening) to determine whether resistance to existing antimalarial drugs reduces parasite
sensitivity to the compounds under evaluation.
Different research groups have incorporated a variety of modifications of the basic in vitro screens
listed above,which can influence the measurement of drug activity levels,as follows.
Unsynchronized versus synchronized cultures.For pre- liminary screening of diverse compounds, the
less demanding (but less sensitive) method ofusing unsyn- chronized cultures is widely used.
SYNCHRONIZEDCULTURES are used when comparing a series ofcompounds,estab- lishing rank order
ofactivities and determining potency against different parasite stages54.
Duration ofincubation.Most assays incorporate incu- bation with test compounds for 48 hours,the
duration of one erythrocytic cycle.
Incubations can also be extended to 72 hours or longer.This can generate more reproducible IC
50values when working with unsyn- chronized cultures and is important when testing slower-acting
compounds such as antibiotics.
