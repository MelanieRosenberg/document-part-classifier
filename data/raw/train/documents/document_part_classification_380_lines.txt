somnolence as a side effect is reproducible in susceptible individuals (White and Rumbold 1988).
Sedation is a com- mon side effect of the traditional antipsychotics, with chlorpromazine and
thioridazine somewhat more sedating than haloperidol.
Clinical studies have shown a high inci- dence of persistent sedation with clozapine (46%) with less
frequent reports of sedation with risperidone, olanzapine, sertindole and quetiapine (Monti et al.
2016).
The sed- ation associated with these agents is most likely associated with their known effects on
histaminic receptors.
Doxepin, a sedating psychotropic agent with pro- nounced histamine (H-1) receptor antagonism exerts
at least part of its effects by antagonizing orexin (Krystal et al.
2013).
Suvorexant, is an orexin antagonist designed to lower waking arousal (Norman and Anderson 2016).
Currently, it is being heavily marketed as a hypnotic (Rhyne and Anderson 2015).
As based on performance and driving tests, this agent is known to produce a dose-related next day
increase in somnolence for all age groupings tested (Farkus 2013).
Sedative drug effects on daytime sleepiness are summarized in Table 4.
Clinically these agents are sometimes used off-label for their sedative effects.
Among antihypertensives in wide use, the complaints of tiredness, fatigue and daytime sleepiness are
commonly associated with drugs having antagonistic effects at the norepinephrine neuroreceptor
(Dimsdale 1992).
The complaints of tiredness, fatigue and daytime sleepiness (2–4.3%) associated with beta-blocker
use may occur secondary to disturbed sleep or direct action of the drug.
Beta-blocking drugs with vasodilating properties (e.g.
carvedilol, labetalol) are also associated with reported fatigue and somnolence (3–11%).
Sedation is among the most common side ef- fects reported for the alpha-2 agonists clonidine and
methyldopa (30–75%) (AHFS 2003).
Alpha-1 antagonists (e.g.  terazosin, prazosin) are sometimes associated with transient sedation.
Prazosin, a norepinephine antagonist, has demonstrated value in treating insomnia associated with
PTSD nightmares (Raskind et al.
2003).
Clonidine is sometimes utilized to treat the agitation and insomnia that result from using
amphetamines to treat AD/HD in pediatric patients (Ming et al.
2011).
