Effective immediately, hospitals shall notify an EMS provider if a patient transported to the
hospital by that provider’s EMS crew subsequently tests positive for the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)
virus.
Notification must occur within 48 hours of the positive test result.
This is a change from the previous 12-hour notification requirement.
Notification of a positive test result is required regardless of whether CDC’s recommended use of
personal protective equipment (PPE) during transport of any individual with suspected or confirmed
COVID-19 was observed.
Notification shall not include the name of the patient who tested positive.
• Section 6.08 (a) - Every hospital shall provide notification as required in this Section to police
officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians, private emergency medical services providers,
and ambulance personnel who have provided or are about to provide transport services, emergency
care, or life support services to a patient who has been diagnosed as having a dangerous
communicable or infectious disease.
Such notification shall not include the name of the patient, and the emergency services provider
agency and any person receiving such notification shall treat the information received as a
confidential medical record.
• Section 6.08(c) - The hospital shall send the letter of notification no later than 48 hours after
a confirmed diagnosis of any of the bloodborne communicable diseases listed by the Department
pursuant to subsection (b).
The hospital shall attempt to make verbal communication, followed by written notification only if
the police officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians, private emergency medical services
providers, or ambulance personnel have indicated both verbally and on the ambulance run sheet that.
