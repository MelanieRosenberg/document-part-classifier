Preparing students to be able to think critically is one of the key goals for many professionals in
higher education, and it is also a quality sought by most employers of university graduates
(Sulaiman, Rahman, & Dzulkifli, 2008).
Under a Thailand 4.0 vision, critical thinking skills are stated to be a key pillar among the goals
for a new, knowledge-based economy (Jones & Pimdee, 2017).
These skills, however, are limited, as according to a recent study evaluating logical thinking and
analytical skills, of 6,235 students in ten Thai provinces, the average final score was just 36.5%,
with only 2.09% passing the exam (Rujivanarom, 2016).
Over 2,500 years ago Plato in his discussions of logic indicated that critical thinking is the tool
that helps individuals find answers or solutions to a person’s confusions and problems
(Thayer-Bacon, 1998).
Socrates, Plato’s teacher, believed that discussion and critical thinking with knowledge reside in
the mind of the individual, rather than a teacher transmitting knowledge to a student (Ornstein &
Levine, 2006).
Nearly 2,500 years later, scholars and educators are still discussing the mechanisms, importance,
and outcomes of critical thinking skills (or lack thereof).
Contemporary evidence of the importance of critical thinking skills for employment has been provided
from the National Association of Colleges and Employers [NACE] (2016) which indicated that critical
thinking/problem-solving skills were ranked most important by the 144 surveyed employers (Table 1).
This is also consistent with the research results obtained by Bassham, Irwin, Nardone, and Wallace
(2013) which indicated that college education is responsible for the development of critical
thinking skills which, in their turn, lead to higher-order thinking.
This is also consistent with (Costa & Kallick, 2014) who stated that critical thinking skills are
consistently included in all the lists of essentials behind college and career readiness (Kraisuth &
Panjakajornsak, 2017).
