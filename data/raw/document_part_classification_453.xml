Building on Failures Researchers continue on their search for effective new treatments for the more than 120 forms of brain cancer, but they face great challenges.93 Since 1998, there have only been 3 new drug approvals for brain cancer, while another 75 medicines have failed in the development process having been discontinued, suspended, or had no development reported.94 That is a 25:1 ratio of unsuccessful attempts to FDA-approved medicines. Decades of research have provided limited treatment options for patients facing aggressive, late-stage forms of brain cancer. Although challenges persist, researchers continue to use past setbacks to inform future discoveries in brain cancer therapies.
