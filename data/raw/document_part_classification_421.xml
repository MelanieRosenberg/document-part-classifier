The prevailing models of emergency medical transport used in North America and Western Europe are quite costly and would be impractical for most low-income countries. Severe resource constraints, the poor condition of roads or trails, and a lack of fuel may dictate the utilization of a wider range of options. In the United Republic of Tanzania, for example, modes of emergency transportation include motor- boats, canoes, bicycles with trailers, tricycles with platforms, tractors with trailers, reconditioned vehicles, and ox carts (22).

Healthcarefacilitiesdifferwidelyinrespectofequipment,staff and resources, and they consequently possess varying capacities to provide emergency care. For this reason the level of care which can reasonably be expected at a primary care centre is significantly lower than that available at a tertiary care hospital. Nevertheless, some capacity to provide emergency careshouldbeavailableateverylevelofacountry’shealthcare system. A health care facility’s capacity is determined by both human and structural factors. Human factors include the number and mix of health care workers and their level of training.Structuralfactorsincludespace,medications,supplies and specialized equipment. The level of demand placed onthe facility by the surrounding population may also dictate which services are offered and whether they can be accessed at short notice. Health care facilities of poor quality produce poor outcomes (23–27). Initial triage and treatment constitute one

of the weakest links in the system. A study in Malawi revealed that the condition of many seriously ill children arriving at clinicshadnotpreviouslybeenrecognized.Insteadofreceiving immediate emergency care they were kept waiting for long periods before being given proper treatment. This resulted in avoidable deaths and disability (28). In Mexico, verbal autopsies of 132 children who died revealed that the majority had been seen by a physician within three days of death. Poor selection of medications and late referral to tertiary care were judged to be important contributory factors in more than half the deaths (29). A qualitative study of 21 hospitals in seven developing countries found that poor triage of incoming patients and inadequate provision of emergency care jeopar- dized the lives of arriving patients (30). Fourteen of the facilities (including 10 of 13 district hospitals) did not have an adequate triage system. A comprehensive review of the management of 131 children treated at these facilities found evidenceofinappropriateordelayedtriagein8%ofcases,poor clinical assessments in 41%, and potentially harmful delays in treatment in 19%. Several international health projects aimed at improving initial triage and treatment have been instituted at district health care facilities. Most focus on the strengthening of maternal and child health. One such project produced guidelines for emergency triage and treatment (28). An evaluation of these guidelines demonstrated that they significantly decreased the time required to assess children in need of urgent medical attention (31). In Sierra Leone a health care facility was upgraded in order to enhance its ability to provide prompt medical and surgicaltreatmenttowomenwithcomplicationsofpregnancy. The annual number of obstetric procedures rose from 2 to 38 over a period of five years. During the same period the
