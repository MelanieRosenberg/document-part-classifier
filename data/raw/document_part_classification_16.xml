                  This course is equivalent to the following Rutgers-NB course:
                  This course should count as a major elective in my department, and should  be
                  given the transfer equivalent code 01:        :MAJ. (enter your department  code)
                  This course should count as a general elective in my department, and should be given the

                  This course should be given elective credit only. It should not count as a course for my

                  This course is not transferable.
