Use of recommended colorectal cancer screening tests can both detect cancer early, when treatment is more effective, and pre- vent cancer, through the detection and removal of precancerous polyps. However, in 2013, only 59% of adults 50 years of age and older reported receiving colorectal cancer screening according to guidelines.81
Treatment for cancers of the colon and rectum varies by tumor location, characteristics, and stage. Surgical procedures for colorectal cancer include local tumor excision or destruction, colectomy (removal of all or part of the colon), proctectomy (removal of the rectum), and proctocolectomy (removal of the rectum and all or part of the colon). The majority of early stage (I and II) colon cancers are treated with colectomy alone (84%), while most patients with stage III disease receive chemotherapy in addition to surgery (67%) (Figure 6, page 11).
For rectal cancer, 61% of stage I patients have a proctectomy or proctocolectomy, about half of whom also receive radiation and/ or chemotherapy (Figure 7). In contrast to colon cancer, stage II and III rectal cancers are often treated with chemotherapy com- bined with radiation before surgery (neoadjuvant). Chemotherapy is the main treatment for metastatic rectal cancer, although in some cases surgery is possible. A number of targeted drugs are also available to treat metastatic disease.
For patients undergoing surgery, an ostomy (creation of an abdominal opening, or stoma, for elimination of body waste) may be needed. A colostomy is when a stoma is created from the large intestine, and an ileostomy is when it is created from the small intestine. In many cases, once the colon or rectum heals,
the stoma is closed and the ends of the large intestine recon- nected in a procedure called colostomy reversal. Rectal cancer patients require a colostomy more often than colon cancer patients (29% versus 12%, respectively).82 A permanent colos- tomy may be required if the anus and the sphincter muscle are removed during surgery.
The 5- and 10-year relative survival rates for colorectal cancer are 65% and 58%, respectively. When colorectal cancer is detected at an early stage, the 5-year survival rate is 90% (Figure 5, page 9); however, only 39% of cases are diagnosed at this stage (Figure 4, page 8), in part due to the underuse of screening.
Long-term survivors of colorectal cancer report a good overall quality of life compared with that of the general population, but higher rates of depression.83 In addition, some difficulty with chronic diarrhea occurs in about one-half of colorectal cancer survivors.84 Bowel dysfunction (including increased stool fre- quency, incontinence, and perianal irritation) is common among rectal cancer survivors, especially those treated with pelvic radiation.85, 86 In addition, survivors may suffer from bladder dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, and negative body image.40, 87 Many of these issues are more common in rectal cancer survi- vors, particularly those with a colostomy.88 A trained ostomy therapist may be able to address several of these concerns, as well as issues that arise from colostomy care, such as skin irrita- tion and dietary considerations.89
