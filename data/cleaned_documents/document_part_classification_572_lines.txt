a physician intentionally stimulates a physiologic response by CO 2 inhalation [31], sodium lactate infusion [32,33], or cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4) injection [32,34]. These chemical exposures are used as potent tools to design controlled studies with predictable levels of PA episodes. In a study with healthy volunteer subjects using carbon dioxide inhalation to provoke panic and anxiety, propranolol significantly decreased heart rate, a cardiovascular somatic symptom, but did not provide psychic anxiolytic benefit [35].
Propranolol has also been investigated in patients suffering from severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Two clinical studies of this beta blocker have shown possible benefits in the early-stage interventional prevention and subsequent therapy of PTSD [36,37]. Subsequent reports have also echoed that propranolol might be effective for this condition [38-40], although other reports dispute this conclusion [41,42]. When considered in aggregate these clinical studies of propranolol, as the well known prototypical beta blocker, provide convincing evidence that the drug can exert somatic (i.e., peripheral) effects on the cardiovascular system in the context of panic and anxiety disorders. With regard to affecting the psychic (CNS) symptoms, the results have been negative, inconsistent, or inconclusive. That being said, there is some limited evidence that propranolol can exert some psychic (CNS) benefits in clinical stress trials. In a pair of clinical studies, propranolol (a central and peripheral beta-blocker) significantly enhanced problem solving during stress, whereas nadolol (peripheral only beta-blocker) and lorezapam (benzodiazepine) did not [43, 44]. Thus, propranolol enhanced cognitive flexibility (“creativity”) during stress. It remains unclear whether propranolol alone can appreciably reduce psychic effects. In aggregate the clinical evidence does not support a benefit regarding psychic (CNS) anxiety symptoms.
Numerous alternative beta blockers are available in lieu of propranolol. Notable among these is the common drug, atenolol, that is available in oral solid dose forms ranging from 25 to 100 mg for the treatment of hypertension. Multiple doses per day may be permitted. It has been used to suppress stage fright in performers when administered orally in advance [45]. Atenolol is a beta-1 selective peripheral-acting agent without CNS effects, which should reduce the risk for asthmatic subjects [46]. Thus, atenolol might be preferred over the nonselective beta blockers for patients affected by asthma or COPD [47]. Oral atenolol at 50 - 200 mg doses suppressed heart rate by ~ 23 - 24 beats per minute (bpm) vs. ~ 10 bpm on placebo [46]. Also,
Another beta blocker is nadolol, which is non-selective and with a preference for beta-1 receptors. It does not pass through the blood-brain barrier. In a clinical trial with musicians, nadolol reduced pulse rate and improved one aspect of performance related to tremor [48]. A similar result was obtained for nadolol in students’ singing performance [49]. In spite of being non- selective, nadolol might ironically benefit the pulmonary function in asthma patients based upon the appropriate dosage, an anti-intuitive result [50].
An alternative beta blocker is pindolol, a non-selective agent, which can enhance the effects of co-administered antidepressants and has some 5-HT antagonist property. Pindolol reduced symptoms of performance anxiety in musicians [51]. Another example is betaxolol that can also cross the blood- brain barrier. Daily oral betaxalol was delivered at 5 - 40 mg per day in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and other anxiety-related conditions. Anxiety and panic attacks were reduced within several days [52]. This anxiolytic benefit is prophylactic, as the effects are observed in days, rather than in minutes.
In view of the clinical studies and off-label use of various beta blockers, psychiatrists are aware that beta blockers can provide some symptomatic relief with regard to performance anxiety [53]. However, beta blockers alone do not sufficiently address the aggregate symptoms of panic and acute anxiety episodes, and especially the psychic symptoms thereof (e.g., fear, avoidance, and anxiousness).
Beta blockers also exhibit some benefit with regard to alcohol and drug abuse. The abuse of alcohol, prescription drugs, and illegal drugs (e.g., opioids, opiates, and cocaine) are major mental health care concerns. The repetitive abuse of these chemicals can produce physiologic dependence, tolerance, addiction, and neurologic damage. The symptoms of sudden withdrawal depend upon the abused substance, the impairment of neurological and neuroendocrine pathways, as well as somatic organ impairment. The withdrawal from addictive substances produces an array of symptoms, many of which overlap with the symptoms of panic and acute anxiety episodes. Delirium tremens (DTs) occur in some alcoholics upon abrupt cessation of drinking. The symptoms of alcohol-related DTs are very similar to those of panic attacks, and are in part related to beta adrenergic effects. The DTs can have serious and even life- threatening consequences. The standards-of-care for DTs are oral benzodiazepines. Withdrawal from opioid and/or opiate addiction is physiologically distinct from alcohol withdrawal.
With regard to beta blockers in substance abuse, atenolol has been shown in placebo-controlled trials to be beneficial in alcohol withdrawal [54-56]. Pindolol has been used to treat alcohol withdrawal [57]. Timolol had a minimal effect on a subset of symptoms of patients experiencing alcohol withdrawal [58].With regard to cocaine abuse, propranolol has been used to treat withdrawal and overdoses [59, 60]. Note that propranolol has also been shown to suppress tremors [61], consistent with one of the perceived benefits of beta blockers in performance anxiety in musicians (above).
