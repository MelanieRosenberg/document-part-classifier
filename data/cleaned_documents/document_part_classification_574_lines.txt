receptor antagonist that affects the autonomic nervous system and reduces cardiovascular symptoms (e.g., tachycardia and hypertension) resulting from epinephrine in the circulation. Beta blockers interfere with receptor binding by catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine, of which epinephrine is the principal catecholamine affecting the cardiovascular symptoms. Propranolol is a lipophilic beta blocker that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, it can affect both somatic and CNS target tissues.
Propranolol is routinely delivered orally. Propranolol in Inderal® is available in oral doses ranging from 10 to 80 mg per dose for the treatment of hypertension. Multiple doses per day may be permitted. This drug can also be absorbed mucosally, as demonstrated by sublingual delivery [12], and its bioavailability is higher when absorbed by this route rather than orally [13,14]. Propranolol has been delivered sublingually at 10 and 40 mg per dose [12,13], although this can produce mouth paresthesia, an undesirable effect. Also, propranolol has been delivered by rectal administration in mammals [15]. It does not demonstrate chemical dependence or sedation that are common side effects of many psychiatric medications. Propranolol is prescribed for the treatment of various cardiovascular indications with FDA approval, most notably hypertension, arrhythmia, angina, as well as prophylaxis of migraines. However, there is evidence that it can have some benefit with regard to a subset of the symptoms of panic and anxiety disorders. The drug’s anxiolytic potential was recognized as early as 1966, “Emotions are expressed through the autonomic nervous system, and anxiety states are associated with increased secretion of catecholamines. Propranolol may therefore have a place in the treatment of anxiety, especially when the symptoms are related to the cardiovascular system [16].” This prescient comment five decades ago was subsequently validated by clinical studies with regard to both aspects: (a) propranolol and other beta blockers have been used “off label” in the USA for the near-term prophylaxis of performance anxiety; and (b) the pharmacologic benefits of propranolol and other beta blockers are restricted to the cardiovascular system’s effects per se. The evidence is provided below. The beneficial anxiolytic effects are limited to blocking the pharmacologic effects of catecholamines upon the cardiovascular system without addressing the psychic (CNS) symptoms or other somatic symptoms of acute anxiety and panic, with the possible exception of tremors. (Table 1) summarizes the relevant evidence from clinical investigations in the literature regarding beta blockers used to treat anxiety conditions. Daily oral propranolol has been demonstrated in one prophylactic study to suppress panic attacks in subjects diagnosed with panic disorder and agoraphobia [17]. Tyrer and Lader demonstrated some effectiveness of oral propranolol in treating somatic anxiety symptoms, but not psychic (mental) anxiety [18,19]. Another daily oral prophylactic study compared propranolol (3 x 80 mg/day) to oxprenolol (3 x 80 mg/day) and revealed that both beta blockers reduced symptoms of anxiety at one or two weeks duration [20]. Both treatments reduced heart rate; propranolol by ~ 21 - 32 bpm and oxprenolol by ~ 16 - 23 bpm. However, propranolol was more effective at reducing palpitations when assessed on day 7 compared to oxprenolol. Another study demonstrated that

a single dose of 40 mg of oxprenolol prior to speaking to an audience suppressed tachycardia in performance anxiety [21]. In contrast, in another clinical study daily oral propranolol was not effective at treating panic disorder and agoraphobia with panic attacks [22].
The TSST method has been used to study the effects of oral propranolol in volunteer subjects [25-28]. The assessments of psychic anxiety can be assessed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) or other similar tools [29,30]. The somatic and psychic effects of oral propranolol were tested using the TSST method in healthy adult volunteers. Propranolol (40 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, reduced systolic blood pressure, and enhanced cognitive flexibility during stress. In another study propranolol (80 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, but paradoxically increased salivary cortisol, and did not significantly affect BP or subjective stress [25]. But, in another TSST study daily oral propranolol (80 mg) did not affect the salivary cortisol response [27].
