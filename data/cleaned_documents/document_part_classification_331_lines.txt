The numbers in each block are codes for the treatment given to each animal. The purpose of such a design is to reduce heterogeneity associated with time, space and some physical varia- tion. The five animals in Block 1 would be chosen to be as similar as possible with respect to age, weight, genotype and any other variable which might influence the outcome. They would then be assigned at random to one of the five treatments. The animals would be housed in close proximity, and possibly even in the same cage, if the different treatments can be given in such a situation. When measurements are to be made on the animals, those in Block 1 would be treated as a group, with all measurements being made within a short period by the same per- son. Animals in the other blocks would likewise be selected to be as uniform as possible, but might differ in body weight or age, etc. from those in Block 1. They could be measured at a dif- ferent time, if necessary by a different person. Thus, within each block any comparison among treatments would be made on animals which are in all possible ways as similar as possible. The unwanted variation shows up as differences between blocks. This is then removed mathe- matically in the statistical analysis.
The randomised block design provides a means to break down an experiment into smaller parts, which can be handled more conveniently. In most cases, it will increase the precision at no extra cost, apart from the need for a slightly more-complex statistical analysis.
example, be difficult for a factorial experi- mental design with several treatment combi- nations and dependent variables. An estimate of the SD could be obtained from a previous study, from the literature, or from a pilot study. However, all these sources of informa- tion are subject to error. The significance level is usually set, somewhat arbitrarily, at 0.05, and the power is likewise often set at 80(cid:150)90%. Thus, although doing a power analysis is a useful exercise in showing the potential capa- bility of various proposed experiments to detect an effect of biological interest, it does not always give a definitive answer of the most appropriate size of each experiment. It is strongly recommended, therefore, that sam- ple sizes are continually reviewed as experi- mental results become available.
An advantage of a power analysis is that it can be used to explore the implications of negative results, i.e. those in which there is no significant difference between treatment means. Such negative results might be of bio- logical interest, particularly in safety testing, if they are real, but are of little interest if the lack of statistical significance was because the experiment was too small to detect a treatment difference of potential interest. Thus, a power analysis can be used to find out the probability that the experiment would have been able to detect a specified treatment effect if it was really there. For example, in the diet experiment discussed previously, suppose that an experiment had been undertaken to compare the two diets with ten mice per group, and that the mean
