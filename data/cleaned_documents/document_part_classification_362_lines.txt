In this report, the term “cancer survivor” refers to any person with a history of cancer, from the time of diagnosis through the remainder of their life. Henceforth, the terms cancer patient and cancer survivor are used interchangeably without preference, although it is recognized that not all people with a cancer diag- nosis identify with the term “cancer survivor.”
The goals of treatment are to “cure” the cancer, if possible; pro- long survival; and provide the highest possible quality of life during and after treatment. A cancer is cured when all traces of the cancer have been removed from the patient’s body. Although it is usually not possible to know if the cancer is completely eradicated, for many patients, the initial course of therapy is successful and the cancer never returns. However, some cancer- free survivors must cope with the long-term effects of treatment, as well as psychological concerns such as fear of recurrence. Cancer patients, caregivers, and survivors must have the infor- mation and support they need to play an active role in decisions that affect treatment and quality of life.
More than 15.5 million children and adults with a history of cancer were alive on January 1, 2016, in the United States. This estimate, also referred to as cancer prevalence, does not include carcinoma in situ (non-invasive cancer) of any site except uri- nary bladder, nor does it include basal cell or squamous cell skin

NOTE: Beginning with the 2016-2017 edition, estimates for specific cancer types now take into account the potential for a history of more than one cancer type. Estimates should not be compared to those from previous years. See Sources of Statistics, page 34, for more information.
