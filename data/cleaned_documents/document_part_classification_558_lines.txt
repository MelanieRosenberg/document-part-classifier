Each framework differs in terms of its audience, development process, and measures of benefit and cost. NCCN and ASCO are patient/provider facing, but ICER is targeted to payers. Methodological transparency also varies: ICER and ASCO have open comment periods and update their approaches based on stakeholder input, while NCCN has no formal public comment process. A comparison of the frameworks on multiple dimensions appears in Tables 1 and 2.
Early evidence suggests that value frameworks hold promise in providing reliable, consistent measures of quality. A recent study applied the NCCN, ASCO, and ICER frameworks to five advanced lung cancer drugs to assess the rankings across frameworks and the degree to which they provide consistent determinations of drug quality. The frameworks ranked each of the drugs similarly, with stronger agreement between ASCO and NCCN than ICER and NCCN. Inter-rater reliability for each drug was highest for ASCO, and lowest for ICER.36
However, value frameworks are far from industry standard. The primary users of the ICER framework have been payers, with the goal of informing coverage decision processes. Physicians have yet to adopt NCCN and ASCO in a systematic way. One optimistic take voiced by members of the Gant Consortium was that as outcomes-based risk sharing agreements between drug manufacturers and payers gain in popularity, value frameworks may establish guardrails for contract negotiations.
