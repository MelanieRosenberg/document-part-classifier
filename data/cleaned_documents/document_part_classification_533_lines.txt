Even with sufficient clinical trial evidence at the time of regulatory approval, it is important to recognize that the benefits may not be realized in clinical practice because of a range of reasons, such as bias in measuring outcomes in clinical trials or underreporting of adverse events (78).
For newer targeted cancer medicines, there are two additional areas of uncertainty. Firstly, despite their established mechanisms of action, targeted cancer medicines may not have clinically-meaningful activities against all tumours with a matching genetic mutation. To this point, a clinical trial has found that the progression-free survival of patients with metastatic solid tumour refractory to standard of care did not improve with the use of targeted therapies that matched with the tumour’s molecular profile but outside their approved indications, compared to patients who received treatment at the choice of their treating physicians (79). This means that targeted therapies should only be used according to approved indications and not based on identified molecular alternations or the general type of cancer.
Secondly, a major limitation of targeted cancer medicines is the occurrence of treatment resistance which can result in a lack of response (termed intrinsic resistance) or partial or loss of responses over time (termed acquired resistance) (80). Clinically, this means that patients may experience prolonged progression- free survival, but not improved overall survival. While researchers continue to unravel the complex mechanisms of and mitigation strategies for treatment resistance, it is important to recognize that the use of single targeted therapies may not have durable treatment effects in clinical practice. Furthermore, while the use of targeted therapies in combination may in theory mitigate the emergence of treatment resistance (81), safety consideration either preclude the use of such combination, or compromise the doses at which individual agents could be used in combination, which might in turn lower its efficacy (82). Outcomes observed in clinical trials may not translate into benefits for patients in clinical practice
On 22–23 March 2018, the EML Cancer Medicines Working Group discussed extant evidence on the magnitude of benefits of cancer medicines. The Working Group also shared country experience in facilitating access to existing cancer medicines on the EML, newer high-cost cancer medicines and cancer care in general. Below is a summary of the main points presented and discussed in the meeting (83).
