1. Onset  and pattern                    When   did the pain start? How  often does  it occur? Has its intensity changed?
2. Location                              Where  is the pain? Is it local to the incisional site, referred, or elsewhere?
3. Quality of pain                       What  does  the pain feel like?
4. Intensity                             How  severe is the pain? (See Table 1)
5. Aggravating  and  relieving           What  makes  the  pain better or worse?

6. Previous treatment                    What  types of treatment  have  been  effective or ineffective in the past to relieve the pain?
7. Effect                                How  does  the pain affect physical function, emotional  distress, and sleep?
8. Barriers to pain assessment           What  factors might  affect accuracy or reliability of pain assessments128 (eg, cultural or language barriers,
cognitive barriers, misconceptions  about  interventions)?
Pain assessment involves more than just quantifying theintensityofpain.Highpainintensityratingsorbehav- ioralscalescoresthatdonotrespondtousualcareshould be investigated to determine whether the pain might be due to a new medical issue or surgical complication and the potential role of opioid tolerance and psychological distress. Assessment should determine what interven- tions have been effective for the pain, how the pain af- fects function, the type of pain (eg, neuropathic, visceral, somatic, muscle spasms), and whether there are barriers to effective pain management, such as cultural orlanguagedifferences,cognitivedeficits,orpatientmis- conceptions about pain management (Table 2). In addi- tion, it is not sufficient to assess pain only at rest. Pain that is relativelywell controlled at rest canbe severe dur- ing movement or with specific activities that cause increased pain (eg, swallowing after tonsillectomy), with important implications for symptom management and recovery. The panel suggests that clinicians assess pain at rest and with activities, as the latter is often more severe and difficult to control than pain at rest.110,270 Presence of pain with activity has important implications for use of additional interventions and discharge planning. For example, pain that is well controlled at rest but severe with movement can have major effects on a patientâ€™s ability to participate in postsurgical rehabilitation and return to normal function, and pain with swallowing after tonsillectomy could increase risk for dehydration. Assessments for other clinical issues such as sedation, delirium, and nausea or other side effects related to interventions are also important to help guide decisions regarding adjustmentofthe postoperativepain management plan. There is insufficient evidence to guide firm recom- mendations on optimal timing or frequency of patient reassessments in the postoperative setting. The timing of assessments after administration of an intervention should be informed by the time to achieve peak ef- fects, which is typically 15 to 30 minutes after paren- teral drug therapy or 1 to 2 hours after administration of an oral analgesic. With nonpharma- cologic interventions, pain relief often occurs during or immediately after their application. The optimal fre- quency of reassessment is likely to depend on a num- ber of factors, including the type of surgical procedure, the adequacy of initial pain relief, the pres- ence of side effects, presence of comorbidities, and
changes in clinical status. Reassessments might be per- formed less frequently for patients with more stable pain (eg, patients who have exhibited good pain con- trol without side effects after 24 hours of stable ther- apy). Pain reassessments might be useful at the time of nursing shift changes or with new caregivers to establish a baseline and promote continuity of care, although evidence showing that routine reassessment of pain at nursing shift changes is associated with improved clinical outcomes is not available.
(cid:2) The panel recommends that clinicians offer multi- modal analgesia, or the use of a variety of analgesic medications and techniques combined with non- pharmacological interventions, for the treatment of postoperative pain in children and adults (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Multimodal analgesia, defined as the use of a variety of analgesic medication and techniques that target different mechanisms of action in the peripheral and/or central nervous system (which might also be combined with nonpharmacological interventions) might have ad- ditiveorsynergisticeffectsandmoreeffectivepainrelief compared with single-modality interventions. For example, clinicians might offer local anesthetic-based regional (peripheral and neuraxial) analgesic techniques in combination with systemic opioids and other analge- sics as part of a multimodal approach to perioperative pain. Because of the availability of effective nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies for postop- erative pain management, the panel suggests that clini- cians routinely incorporate around the clock nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies into multi- modal analgesia regimens. Systemic opioids might not be required in all patients. One study suggests that it shouldbeavoidedwhennotneeded,becauselimitedev- idence suggests that perioperative opioid therapy might be associated with increased likelihood of long-term opioid use, with its attendant risks.4
