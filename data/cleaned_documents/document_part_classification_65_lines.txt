☐ Native Heritage Speakers: My student is a fluent speaker of Spanish or Japanese and is applying for dual language immersion at either John Stanford or McDonald International. I understand that a proficiency test required for K and 1st grade prior for language placement but grades 2–5 is for admittance only. I understand that my student is not guaranteed an assignment in their preferred language unless they pass the proficiency assessment.
