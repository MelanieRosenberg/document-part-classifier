Choosing a doctor to treat cancer is one of the most important decisions for newly diagnosed cancer patients. Typically, the doctor who made the preliminary diagnosis, usually the patient’s primary care physician, will recommend appropriate cancer specialists. There are three main types of cancer physicians or oncologists, based on the type of treatment service they provide: medical (those who treat cancer using chemotherapy and other drugs), surgical, and radiation. Some types of oncologists focus on specific populations. For example, pediatric oncologists spe- cialize in the care of children, and hematologists specialize in patients with blood disorders. Some cancers, such as skin and prostate cancer, may be treated by doctors who specialize in specific body systems (i.e., dermatologists and urologists, respectively). Plastic surgeons may also be involved in cancer treatment by performing reconstructive surgeries as part of cancer care, particularly for patients with breast or head and neck cancers.
To aid in the selection of an oncologist, visit the American Soci- ety of Clinical Oncology’s website, cancer.net, for a searchable online database of cancer specialists. Many other physician organizations have online physician databases, such as the American Society of Hematology, the Society of Surgical Oncol- ogy, the American Medical Association, the American College of Surgeons, the American Osteopathic Association, and the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.
Cancer patients should ask prospective doctors direct questions about their level of experience, including the number of patients they have treated with the same type of cancer or the number of surgical procedures they have performed and their outcomes. Questions about how the doctor organizes cancer care with
