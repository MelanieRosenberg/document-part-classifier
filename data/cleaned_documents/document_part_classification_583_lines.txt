Oklahoma State Law and the federal No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) require that we identify whether students in our school district are English Language Learners (ELL). Both of these laws require a language instruction educational program for ELL students with limited English proficiency (LEP). The identification process and placement of your child in a language instruction educational program is based on a combination of the home language questionnaire, teacher judgment, English test results and other measures. Your child’s English proficiency test scores are shown below.
Student Name:  William  Kirby             Student ID: K-65212                   Grade:  8th     Home
Language:  English                   Date Tested: 12/12/2020        Test: IELTS
Composite  (Overall) Score: 7.5        Literacy Score: 8
Your child has been identified as needing services for English Language Learners (ELL). Your child will be placed in the ESL/Bilingual Education dual language immersion program, as outlined in the attached document. We believe that this program will help meet your child’s educational needs and enhance his/her academic success in school. Your child will be assessed twice yearly, or as needed, to determine progress toward individual ELL goals. When your child scores in the acceptable range (4.5 Literacy/5.0 Overall) on all areas of the W-APT or ACCESS assessment they will be exited from the program. If your student currently has an Individualized Education Program (IEP), their needs will continue to be met through their current accommodations.
You may withdraw your child from services at any time you desire. You may also mark the appropriate box at the bottom of this form. Your child will then be placed in the regular instruction programs for students who are fluent in English. Please seriously consider the consequences of your decision on your child’s long-term educational success. We invite you to visit the school and meet with our staff to learn more about the benefit of the program and other services available at the school. If you have questions, please call the school at 1.580.323.1800.
Please  mark   all that apply   & return   the completed     form  to your   child’s school.
I would  like my child to receive the services available.
I will schedule a parent-teacher conference  to discuss the options  for my child.

Note: If this form is not returned within one (1) week, the district will assume agreement with the language
services decision and begin immediate  implementation   of educational programming.
