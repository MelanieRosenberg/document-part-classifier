has been diagnosed with COVID‐19. Anyone identified as a close contact of the diagnosed individual will receive a separate letter detailing their next steps. Everyone in the class is not a close contact and subject to quarantine. The class will remain open unless another person in the classroom is diagnosed with COVID‐19 and public health identifies the school as the source of that person’s infection. Childcare center/school will remain open based upon the quarantine of all known close contacts and appropriate building cleaning/disinfection being completed.

While many of these symptoms can be seen with other conditions such as allergies, we ask that you seek medical evaluation if you identify any of these symptoms. Loss of taste or smell is very specific to COVID‐19 and may be described as food tasting bland, rather than not being able to taste. If your child develops any of these symptoms, please notify your child’s school, contact your child’s doctor for evaluation/testing, and keep your child home from school.
If your child develops symptoms and you seek medical evaluation and/or testing, you can talk with your doctor about getting your child tested based on the potential exposure in the classroom. If you do not have a provider, you can go to this website for current testing options and locations:
Based on this information, you may choose to keep your child home out of an abundance of caution. If you choose to do so, please contact at your school so that they can help manage the transition to online instruction for your child.
