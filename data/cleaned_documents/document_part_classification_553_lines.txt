Profit control is an effective measure to manage medicine prices insofar as the regulators have control over the supply of medicines at certain points along the supply chain. Typically, this means that the regulator needs to have full visibility of the supply and distribution chains. The regulator also needs to have the capacity and ability to enforce non-compliance. Profit control is most effective when there is a publicly- funded universal programme for the provision of medicines. In contrast, it may be much less effective in health care settings where the private sector plays a significant role in the delivery of medicines, or where the structure of supply chain is complex or under-developed (183).
Some countries may place limits on the frequency and magnitude of price increments, or even impose a price freeze or price reduction (161,184). In the latter, pharmaceutical prices cannot be raised for a predetermined period of time unless there is a justification. For example, since August 2010 (and at least until 2022), Germany has implemented a moratorium to halt price increase for medicines that are not subject to reference pricing, except for inflation (185).
In Canada, the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board requires holders of medicine patents “to file information about the prices and sales of their patented drug products in Canada at introduction and then twice a year until the patent expires”, as set out by the Patent Act. The Board considers the average price of specific strength and dosage of a medicine to assess if a product is priced excessively according to the following criteria (186):
The originator company may file a Voluntary Compliance Undertaking to express its commitment to adjusting the price of the patented medicine in question to a non-excessive level and offsetting any excess revenues, in compliance to the Board’s guidelines. Medicines that have filed a Voluntary Compliance Undertaking include: panitumumab, pegaspargase, crizotinib, fulvestrant, busulfan, nilotinib (187).
