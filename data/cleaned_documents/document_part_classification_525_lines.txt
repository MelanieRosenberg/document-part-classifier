The industry also often justifies prices of medicine by stating that return on investment needs to be sufficient to incentivize the discovery of future medicines (109). To this point, the industry noted that 20% of its revenues were re-invested into R&D (87).
There are debates about whether the returns generated from the sales of medicines, including cancer medicines, are sufficient for pharmaceutical companies to cover their past R&D expenses, maintain their operations and engage in future drug discovery research. For example, some commentators have observed that the revenue generated from the sales of imatinib had exceeded the costs of R&D within two years and “the revenues over the subsequent years of the patent would represent generous profits to the company” (30). Another study found that total revenue from the sales of 10 cancer medicines since approval over a median of four years (US$ 67.0 billion) was 9.3 times the total R&D spending of US$ 7.2 billion (or 7.4 times using an estimated risk-adjusted R&D costs of US$ 9.1 billion) (94).
To systematically assess the financial return of cancer medicines, this report undertook a study to quantify the reported global incomes from the sales of individual medicines approved by the US FDA in 1989–2017 for the treatment of haematological cancers, solid tumours and related conditions such as neutropenia and hypercalcaemia (117). Itemized product sales data were extracted from the consolidated financial reports of originator companies, supplemented and verified with publicly available sources where necessary. Sales incomes were reported net of rebates and discounts but without accounting for expenses and taxes, as per International Financial Reporting Standards.
