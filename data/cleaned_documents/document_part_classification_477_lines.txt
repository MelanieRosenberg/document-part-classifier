Abstract: This Technical Note describes the mechanisms leading to the formation of efflorescence, including probable sources of soluble salts and moisture. Conditions necessary to cause efflorescence to appear are presented, along with design recommendations and practices that reduce the potential for efflorescence.

• Positively identify efflorescence (see Technical  Note 23)          • Isolate exterior brick wythe with an air space
• Determine   if the efflorescence is "new building bloom"            • Waterproof  the exterior of walls that extend below  grade
• Identify causes of efflorescence  using the included  trouble-      • For walls without an  air space, separate  the brick wythe

This Technical Note describes the mechanisms of efflorescence, including possible sources of salts and water, providing a basic understanding of the phenomenon of efflorescence that is essential to minimize its occurrence. Although similar, sources of salts and the development of efflorescence on paving surfaces are discussed in the Technical Notes 14 Series on brick pavements. A thorough program of efflorescence prevention or control may include identification of the type of efflorescence and investigation of its causes before options for correction are considered. This Technical Note is intended to serve as a guide in this process. Procedures for removal of efflorescence are discussed in Technical Note 20.
There are many, often complicated, mechanisms of efflorescence. Simply stated, efflorescence occurs when water containing dissolved salts is brought to the surface of masonry, the water evaporates and the salts are left on the surface of the masonry. The salt solutions may migrate across surfaces of masonry units, between the mortar and units, or through the pores of the mortar or units.
- There must be a source of water in contact with the salts for a period of time sufficient to dissolve them. - The masonry must have a pore structure that allows the migration of salt solutions to the surface or other locations where evaporation of water can occur.
