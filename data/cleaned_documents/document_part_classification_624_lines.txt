A temporary grade of Incomplete (I) may be given if a student’s work has been satisfactory throughout the term but, due to extenuating circumstances, the student needs additional time to complete the remaining assignments. In this context, extenuating circumstances include non-academic factors beyond the student’s control that make it impossible to continue: severe illness, death in the immediate family, drastic change in work or financial situation, or other unusual and extreme situations as deemed appropriate by the instructor. It is the student’s responsibility to request the incomplete grade in writing prior to the close of the academic term. If the instructor grants the request, the instructor and student must promptly complete, sign, and submit the Incomplete Grade Contract to the Education Office. The contract specifies (1) all assignments yet to be completed, (2) the date(s) by which the remaining work is to be submitted to the instructor, and (3) the default grade if the student received no points for missing work. Incomplete grades must be resolved by the agreed-upon time in the contract, which should be no later than that last day of next regular academic term. If the work is not completed by that time, the default grade listed on the form will become the final grade, or an F if no grade is indicated. Only the rarest of situations will warrant additional extensions, and they require the expressed approval of the department chair.
