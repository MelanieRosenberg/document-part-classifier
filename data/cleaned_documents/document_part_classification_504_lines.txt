If you are declining enrollment for yourself or your dependents (including your spouse) because of other health insurance coverage, you may in the future be able to enroll yourself or your dependents in this health plan, provided that you request enrollment within 30 days after your other coverage ends. In addition, if you have a new dependent as a result of marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, you may be able to enroll yourself and your dependents, provided that you request enrollment within 30 days after the marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption.
I affirm that the assertions in this form are true and complete to the best of my knowledge, and I understand that Harvard Pilgrim has the right to terminate coverage, retroactive to the effective date of coverage, for any material misinformation (including omissions) contained in this form.
