This form is to be filled out for anyone receiving a prize or award (cash or gift). When you are making payment to someone this form must be submitted to Payroll & Disbursements with a generic voucher. The correct account code (object code) to use is 4326. If the prize is in the form of a gift, it is still necessary to submit this form to Payroll & Disbursements.
