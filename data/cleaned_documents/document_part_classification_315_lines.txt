To determine if there were possible changes in participants’ ratings before and after the workshop, paired t-tests were run and analyzed. Table 2 shows mean scores and standard deviations (SDs) from the Pre-Workshop Student Survey and the Post-Workshop Student Survey, mean score differences and standard errors (SEs), dependent-samples t-tests results (t statistic and degrees of freedom), p-values, and the effect sizes (measured by dependent-samples Cohen’s d).
Table 3 shows faculty participants’ self-perception of their previous experience in mentoring and as well as faculty participants’ perceptions of the workshop effectiveness. Before the workshop started, the faculty participants (n = 28) showed a medium average of previous experience in mentoring with a wide variability. Specifically, faculty participants (n = 28) yielded a mean of 3.68 (SD = 1.02) on “Do you have substantial previous experience in mentoring?” This showed some faculty do not have much previous mentoring experience while some others have substantial previous mentoring experience.

Variable                                                             Mean  (SD)      N
-Pre-Workshop:
Do you have  substantial previous experience in mentoring?         3.68 (1.02)     28
-Post-Workshop:
The workshop   is helpful.                                         4.77 (0.51)     26
The workshop   is organized well.                                  4.88 (0.33)     26
Will attend future mentoring workshops.                            4.77 (0.51)     26
The length of the workshop is appropriate.                         4.50 (0.65)     26
In addition, these faculty participants’ (n = 26, due to the exclusion of two incomplete post- workshop surveys from faculty) highly-rated perceptions of workshop effectiveness were reported here. Specifically, the majority expressed that the workshop was helpful (M = 4.77, SD = 0.51), that the workshop was organized well (M = 4.88, SD = 0.33), that they would attend future related
