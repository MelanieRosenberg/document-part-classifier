Important: Participation in this program is voluntary. If you participate, a tax lien will be placed on your property. This lien must be satisfied when your property is sold. In the event of your death, your heirs must satisfy the lien before they can acquire clear title. Read the instructions on the back carefully before completing this application.

• For “Torrens” property, the report is a copy of the original certificate of title, which is available from your county recorder (sometimes referred to as a “condition of register”). The certificate must be dated within 30 days of your application. • For abstract property, the report is prepared by a licensed abstracter showing the last deed recorded and any unsatisfied liens or judgments (sometimes referred to as an “owners and encumbrances report”). The report must be dated within 30 days of your application.
