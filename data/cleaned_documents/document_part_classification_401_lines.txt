Summary of C57BL/6 mice infected with GFP-expressing P. berghei sporozoites and treated with metformin, primaquine, and mefloquine, alone or in combination as described in Figures 1 and 3. Prepatency was determined by detecting the presence of GFP+ red blood cells via flow cytometry analysis. The number of mice carrying parasites on days 3 (72 hours) and 5 after sporozoite injection is shown. The total number of infected mice is given in parentheses. The number of mice alive on day 10 is also shown.
under mefloquine or metformin single-drug treatments (P = 0.013 and P = 0.041; Figure 3C). Of note, mice under single or combined metformin treatments showed an extended survival, whereas 84% of the nontreat- ed mice succumbed within 1 week after infection (Table 1). In conclusion, metformin treatment in combi- nation with suboptimal dosage of conventional antimalarials is more efficacious in reducing parasite load.
Metformin is listed by the World Health Organization as an essential medicine to treat and prevent type 2 diabetes. As a biguanide, metformin is related to guanidine and galegine, which can both be extracted from goat’s rue (Galega officionalis). This medicinal plant was traditionally used in medieval Europe as a treat- ment for diabetes and other ailments, including infections such as the plague and typhoid fever. Metformin was first synthesized in 1922, but its use as an antidiabetic agent was only proposed in 1957, a discovery closely linked to malaria owing to the structural relatedness of metformin to proguanil, a highly potent antimalarial biguanide. In the 1940s, metformin was tested in patients with an ongoing malaria blood stage infection while a search was underway for alternatives to proguanil, which was becoming ineffective because of parasite resistance (34, 37). Although no clear effect on parasitemia was found (34), lowered glucose levels were later noticed after metformin treatment (37). Indeed, the antihyperglycemia property appears to be common to most biguanides, but metformin outperforms with minimal lactic acidosis. With a long track record of clinical use, metformin has proved to be highly tolerable, with a strong safety profile and few interactions with other medications. In addition, metformin is water-soluble, is orally bioavail- able, has excellent pharmacokinetic adsorption and excretion properties, and has a low cost of production, making it highly affordable and accessible (37, 38). These properties contribute to metformin’s qualifications as an optimal drug for repurposing (39). Interest in metformin repurposing has been sparked in recent years because of numerous epidemiologic observations and meta-analyses demonstrating positive outcomes and improved prognosis in diabetes patients diagnosed with cancer. To date more than 100 clinical trials in oncolo- gy are underway to determine the benefits of metformin as adjunctive therapy in treating and preventing cancer and longevity-related causes, such as inflammation, senescence, and oxidative damage (39–41). It is also being studied as a potential adjunctive therapy to treat infections such as tuberculosis (25, 42) and AIDS (43). The mechanism of action of metformin is not fully defined because it appears to have multiple pleio- tropic direct and indirect effects on various cell processes and cell targets. In the treatment of diabetes, metformin is widely used to decrease glucose production and output from the liver and increase circulating insulin sensitivity. These effects are thought to be a result of metformin’s interaction with mitochondria, where it alters cellular bioenergetics by inhibiting the respiratory chain complex I. This leads to a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation and subsequent drop in energy with altered ADP-to-ATP ratios (22, 44, 45). As a consequence, several pathways are affected, such as through the activation of the energy sensor AMPK and a shutdown in gluconeogenesis (46–48). AMPK-dependent processes that are altered include suppression of mTOR and insulin receptor signaling (IGF-I) via PI3K/AKT pathways, leading to decreased protein synthesis and cell growth and increased apoptosis and autophagy (49).
