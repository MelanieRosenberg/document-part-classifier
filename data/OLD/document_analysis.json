The final price was decided based on an anticipated rise in revenue even though the manufacturer expected the number of patients receiving the medicine would decline (p.43) (100), and various stakeholders would react negatively to the firm\u2019s final pricing of the product. Furthermore, the manufacturer set a high price for Sovaldi with a view to consolidate the market\u2019s price expectation in preparation for setting an even higher price for a combination product that contains sofosbuvir (Harvoni) that would be launched after Sovaldi. It also included an arbitrary price increase from US$ 27 000 per bottle to US$ 28 000 per bottle (i.e. 3.7% increase) because it would \u201cbe easy from the press release, from 28 days and $28,000\u201d (p.57) (100). This example demonstrates that pricing solely according to commercial goals will impair a health system\u2019s ability to achieve public health goals because high prices limit patient access, thereby limiting the full value potential of the innovation.\n</TEXT",

Patterns of sleep at unusual times may assist in identifying Circadian Rhythm Disorders such as Ad- vanced Sleep Phase Type or Delayed Sleep Phase Type. Assess- ing whether the final awakening occurs spontaneously or with an alarm adds insight into the patient\u2019s sleep needs and natural sleep and wake rhythm. Finally, the clinician must ascertain whether the individual\u2019s sleep and daytime complaints occur despite adequate time available for sleep, in order to distinguish insomnia from behaviorally induced insufficient sleep. IV. Nocturnal Symptoms: Patient and bed partner reports may also help to identify nocturnal signs, symptoms and behav- iors associated with breathing-related sleep disorders (snoring, gasping, coughing), sleep related movement disorders (kick- ing, restlessness), parasomnias (behaviors or vocalization), and comorbid medical/neurological disorders (reflux, palpitations, seizures, headaches). Other physical sensations and emotions associated with wakefulness (such as pain, restlessness, anxi- ety, frustration, sadness) may contribute to insomnia and should also be evaluated. V. Daytime Activities and Daytime Function: Daytime activities and behaviors may provide clues to potential causes and consequences of insomnia. Napping (frequency/day, times, voluntary/involuntary), work (work times, work type such as driving or with dangerous consequences, disabled, caretaker responsibilities), lifestyle (sedentary/active, home- bound, light exposure, exercise), travel (especially across time zones), daytime dysfunction (quality of life, mood, cog- nitive dysfunction), and exacerbation of comorbid disorders should be evaluated in depth.

Patterns of sleep at unusual times may assist in identifying Circadian Rhythm Disorders such as Ad- vanced Sleep Phase Type or Delayed Sleep Phase Type. Assess- ing whether the final awakening occurs spontaneously or with an alarm adds insight into the patient\u2019s sleep needs and natural sleep and wake rhythm. Finally, the clinician must ascertain whether the individual\u2019s sleep and daytime complaints occur despite adequate time available for sleep, in order to distinguish insomnia from behaviorally induced insufficient sleep. IV. Nocturnal Symptoms: Patient and bed partner reports may also help to identify nocturnal signs, symptoms and behav- iors associated with breathing-related sleep disorders (snoring, gasping, coughing), sleep related movement disorders (kick- ing, restlessness), parasomnias (behaviors or vocalization), and comorbid medical/neurological disorders (reflux, palpitations, seizures, headaches). Other physical sensations and emotions associated with wakefulness (such as pain, restlessness, anxi- ety, frustration, sadness) may contribute to insomnia and should also be evaluated. V. Daytime Activities and Daytime Function: Daytime activities and behaviors may provide clues to potential causes and consequences of insomnia. Napping (frequency/day, times, voluntary/involuntary), work (work times, work type such as driving or with dangerous consequences, disabled, caretaker responsibilities), lifestyle (sedentary/active, home- bound, light exposure, exercise), travel (especially across time zones), daytime dysfunction (quality of life, mood, cog- nitive dysfunction), and exacerbation of comorbid disorders should be evaluated in depth. Common daytime consequences include:\n</TEXT",
