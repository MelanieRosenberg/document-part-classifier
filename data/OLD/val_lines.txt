changes in clinical status. Reassessments might be per- formed less frequently for patients with more stable pain (eg, patients who have exhibited good pain con- trol without side effects after 24 hours of stable ther- apy). Pain reassessments might be useful at the time of nursing shift changes or with new caregivers to establish a baseline and promote continuity of care, although evidence showing that routine reassessment of pain at nursing shift changes is associated with improved clinical outcomes is not available.

identical unigrams and exhibit similar semantics-based sequential structures. Hence SVM is not able to differentiate between positive and neutral relationships. To give an example the below sentence has features which are the same as a positive relationship but is labeled as neutral due to lack of contextual information. {\chemical P-ASA} {\relationship 2= increased} intracellular levels of {\chemical reactive oxygen species}. Finally we can also observe that the (1 vs. All) SVM schema behaves differently than the (2 vs. 2). The highest overall accuracy of (1 vs. all) is 0.89, generated by a feature combination of unigrams and unary semantics-based sequential features. We cannot however find any particular combination of kernels that constantly produce a high accuracy. In contrast, in the (2 vs. 2) schema, the linear and polynomial kernel combination tends to produce good results. In addition, (2 vs. 2) in general outperforms (1 vs. all) regardless of the feature set under use. We hence focus on the (2 vs. 2) scheme in the following discussion.

Brick arches usually require no steel reinforcement and are an attractive option. When determining the height of a fireplace opening which incorporates an arch use the maximum height to the arch soffit. Information on arch design may be found in Technical Notes 31 Series.
Cardholder   Signature:
The strength and moisture penetration resistance of a brick masonry cavity wall are affected by the mortar selection and compatibility with the brick units. Portland cement-lime, mortar cement, or masonry cement mortars can be used. However, mortars with an air content less than 12 percent are recommended for their superior bond strength and resistance to moisture penetration. The MSJC Code requires that the allowable flexural tensile stresses be reduced by approximately 50 percent for assemblies constructed with masonry cement mortars or portland cement-lime mortars that have air entrainment. In addition, some building codes prohibit the use of masonry cement mortars and all Type N mortars in Seismic Performance Categories D and E (formerly Seismic Zones 3 and 4). Mortar should meet the proportion requirements of ASTM C 270 Specification for Mortar for Unit Masonry as shown in Table 1. Mortar type selection should be based on project requirements, such as strength and compatibility with a particular brick unit. Types N or S mortars are typically used in brick masonry cavity walls. See Technical Notes 8 Series for more detailed information on mortar types and selection.

explaining this behaviour. Firstly, as indicated by a widely-cited study by a global consulting firm, increasing price would generate larger improvement in profit than other levers of profit (Fig. 3.7, p.31) (150). This may have influenced repeated price increases noted in the market for cancer medicines (147,151) and indeed, markets for patented and generic medicines in other therapeutic areas (152–154). Secondly, as there are many factors influencing demand of medicines other than price (50), it would be sensible for companies focused solely on maximizing profits to focus on price because as it has been said “price is certainty and volume is a bet”.

the relative contribution of clinical and laboratory fac- tors deemed to be important in influencing the proba- bility of developing “persistent inflammatory and/or erosive arthritis that is currently considered to be RA” (hereinafter referred to as “developing RA”). An expert panel was assembled, comprising 12 rheumatologists from Europe and 12 from North Amer- ica with extensive experience in the diagnosis and man- agement of RA. They provided real-life case scenarios of patients with early undifferentiated inflammatory arthri- tis representing low to high probability of developing RA. A 2-day workshop was held in May 2009 in which domains (factors) and categories within those domains that were important in determining the probability of developing RA were identified. When appropriate, these judgments were informed by the results of Phase 1 and other available literature. The relative importance or weights of these domains and their categories were determined by means of decision science theory and conjoint adaptive technology, using the computerized 1000Minds program (www.1000minds.com) in an inter- active and iterative process (26). This analysis permitted the calculation of an individual’s score of the likelihood of developing RA from 0 to 100, where a higher score indicated greater likelihood of RA development. The domains, categories, and weights derived during that initial process are shown in Table 2.

As early as 200 B.C., wind was reportedly used to pump water in China and grind grain in the Middle East. Over the centuries, onshore wind has been harnessed to generate power worldwide. In the nineteenth century, settlers in the United States used windmills to generate electricity for homes and pump water for consumption and crop irrigation; industrialization sparked the development of larger windmills to generate electricity for commercial purposes. Interest in wind energy has waxed and waned with the price of fossil fuels. After the 1973 Arab oil embargo, new ways of converting wind energy into useful power were developed. Many of these approaches have been demonstrated in wind facilities (also known as wind farms, wind power plants, or wind projects), which are groups of turbines that feed electricity into the utility grid. Wind facilities began appearing in California in the 1980s, and, today, the cost of onshore wind-generated electricity is close to that generated from conventional utilities in some locations.

is worth noting that these two long RAIs, as well as the longest introduction in the BESP subcorpus (i.e., BESP5, with 928 words), contained the whole literature review. The only other introduction that also exhausted the literature review was ESPj5. Besides a higher average number of words per RAI, the ESPj subcorpus also had a higher average number of sentences per RAI. The number of paragraphs, however, was smaller in this subcorpus than in the BESP subcorpus. In fact, three of the 10 ESPj introductions only had one paragraph, whereas BESP introductions required at least two. The ratio between the number of sentences and paragraphs shows that eight out of the 10 BESP introductions had fewer than three sentences per paragraph while, in the ESPj corpus, three was the minimum found and the average was 5.2.

DOs are perhaps most commonly confused with DCs, or Doctors of Chiropractic. While there is some overlap between the two types of practitioners, they represent dis- tinct professions and separate schools of thought. Chi- ropractic was first enunciated in 1895 by Daniel David Palmer, who observed that displacement of vertebrae could affect neurotransmission, thus manifesting as dis- ease. Palmer was a magnetic healer, but unlike A.T. Still, he did not have a medical background. While the chiro- practic philosophy is historically focused on the nervous system, the original notion of osteopathic medicine was the need to restore blood flow, in particular, via manipula- tion of the neuromusculoskeletal system.6 The differences in education and training between the two professions are apparent. A table comparing the background of DOs, MDs, and DCs is provided below.16 It is important to note that DOs who go on to specialize in neuromusculoskeltal

Antimalarial efficacy screening: in vitro and in vivo protocols. Supplemental file. animals are prepared and stained with Giemsa. Parasitemia is determined microscopically by counting 4 fields of approximately 100 erythrocytes per field. For low parasitemias (<1%), up to 4000 erythrocytes have to be counted. Alternatively the parasitemia can also be determined by FACS analysis, which works particularly well for parasitemias >1%. The difference between the mean value of the control group (taken as 100%) and those of the experimental groups is calculated and expressed as percent reduction (= activity) using the following equation:

The key idea is that you should read the paper in up to three passes, instead of starting at the beginning and plow- ing your way to the end. Each pass accomplishes specific goals and builds upon the previous pass: The first pass gives you a general idea about the paper. The second pass lets you grasp the paper’s content, but not its details. The third pass helps you understand the paper in depth.

cancers. The 10 most prevalent cancers represented among male and female survivors are shown in Figure 1, page 1. Cancers of the prostate and colon and rectum, and melanoma are the three most prevalent among males, whereas cancers of the breast, uterine corpus, and colon and rectum are most prevalent among females. It is important to note that the number of total survivors is fewer than the sum of all cancers combined because some people are diagnosed with more than one type of cancer. The majority of cancer survivors (67%) were diagnosed 5 or more years ago, and 17% were diagnosed 20 or more years ago (Table 1). Nearly half (47%) of survivors are 70 years of age or older, while only 11% are younger than 50 (Table 2).

Medical tourism is becoming a source of economic gain for many countries and regions of the world. (Carruth and Carruth 2010; Hill n.d.; Kahn 2010) Medical tourism increases the economic situation (Munro 2012; Pocock and Phua 2011) in a destination country, provides care for many individuals willing to pay out of pocket, and lowers health insurance costs for U.S. employers and health insurers willing to pay for health care abroad. It is difficult to determine, with any accuracy, the number of persons travelling from the U.S alone to a foreign country for health care reasons. Estimates of Americans travelling abroad for treatments place the number of persons traveling to India or Thailand for health care reasons in excess of 750,000 persons for 2005 (Herrick 2007; Kahn 2010). A 2003 estimate placed the total number of persons traveling to India, Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia at 1.4 million persons (Heung, Kucukusta, and Song 2011). This estimate increased in 2010 to 6 million persons, with an economic gain of > $4 billion, with half of the revenue going to India (Heung, Kucukusta, and Song 2011; Horowitz, Rosensweig, and Jones 2007; Hill n.d.). As medical tourism develops into a multi-billion dollar industry, with steady annual growth projected, estimates of global economic gains vary between $40 and $100 billion for destination countries (Zwelling 2011; Herrick 2007).

The FDA recently recommended that a warning be issued regarding adverse effects associated with BzRA hypnotics. These medications have been associated with reports of disruptive sleep related behaviors including sleepwalking, eating, driving, and sexual behavior. Patients should be cautioned about the potential for these adverse effects, and about the importance of allowing appropriate sleep time, using only prescribed doses and avoiding the combination of BzRA hypnotics with alcohol, other sedatives, and sleep restriction.

In the Biomedical sector, the current applications of data mining are the most successful and they have become the subfield of medical research. The basis for this growth is that nowadays most of the health related data are stored in small datasets scattered through various Hospitals, Clinics and Research centers. The healthcare sector is presently facing both the economic predictability and the methodological prospect of a data based approach for quality administration. Hence, abundant data mining techniques have been proposed to process medical data stream. Applying data mining techniques to the centralized database will offer to doctors investigative and foretelling tools from the surface of the data. Modern clinical practices also undertake transformation not only in diagnosis and treatment methods, but also in understanding of health and illness concepts. Data Mining can generate information that can be useful to all stakeholders in health care, including patients by identifying effective treatments and best practices. Though data mining methods and tools have been applied in diverse areas for more than 40 years already, their applications in healthcare are comparatively young. Therefore, this paper presents a survey on the significance of Data Mining techniques in Disease Diagnosis and Biomedical Research.

Article downloads and citations measure two different dimensions of scientific knowledge transfer. The first measures general interest in a particular new piece of knowledge; the second measures the incorporation of that knowledge into a new document. Most article downloads take place within the first few months after publication (17, 18), suggesting that the primary func- tion of an article is to keep researchers abreast on the latest findings within a field and secondly to serve as a source document for future citation. Article downloads retrieved shortly after publication have been shown to predict future citations, although their strength of prediction is relatively low (17, 19, 20). A citation, on the other hand, measures a different set of intentions from a much smaller group of partic- ipants. To generate new scientific knowledge, in most cases, one must have access to equipment, materials and facilities, technicians, and the infrastructure neces- sary to support and coordinate them all (21). Authors must be able to analyze their results, capable of pre- senting their findings, and able to communicate them clearly and coherently. Once submitted, scientific man- uscripts must make it through peer-review and be published in an indexed journal in order to be visible

medically related text and metadata features, such as “pa- tients,” “alzheimer,” “health information management,” and “medicine” are also important and of mostly positive polar- ity, since medical articles attract greater news coverage than, say, a recently published computer science paper. As we dis- cuss later, the presence of “alzheimer” as an important, neg- ative feature is more an artifact of the dataset than an iden- tification of trends in popularity. We also find an artifact of year (2016) of the dataset with the feature “zika virus,” due to the 2015-2016 zika epidemic in North and South Amer- ica. Three publishers appear in the top 20, the Massachusetts Medical Society, the publisher of the New England Journal ofMedicine,oneofthemostprestigiouspeer-reviewedmed- ical journals, “The Royal Society,” publisher of the less pres- tigious, but longest-running scientific journal, “Philosophi- cal Transactions of the Royal Society,” and “Elsevier,” one of the largest science publishers.

Finally, we have also compared the effect of the no-relationship polarity by comparing the overall accuracy of (i) combining no- relationship and neutral polarities into one category; and (ii) separating them into two classes. We observe that the overall accuracy of the former ranges between 0.71~0.81 as compared to 0.8~0.91 in the latter when they are separated. This demonstrates the necessity of introducing the “no-relationship” as its own class.

As you know if you ever checked into a hotel or rented a car, the first thing you are asked for is a credit card, which is imprinted and later used to pay your bill. This is an advantage for both you and the hotel or car rental company since it makes checkout easier, faster and more efficient. CCSD would like to make it simple for you to pay any services that are your responsibility after your insurance company processes your claim. We simply maintain your Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express, Flex plan or checking account information on file to satisfy any patient responsibilities such as deductibles, co-insurance or other balances. If you are not aware of your insurance benefits, including your deductible and co-insurance amounts, please contact your carrier. If you have a high deductible, it is recommended that you provide a credit card as opposed to a debit card or check. We will do everything possible to maximize your insurance benefits.

The design of cavity walls is governed by model building codes. Most of these reference the ACI 530/ASCE 5/TMS 402 Building Code Requirements for Masonry Structures, also known as the Masonry Standards Joint Committee (MSJC) Code [2]. The Uniform Building Code incorporates similar design requirements for cavity walls [9]. Seismic design requirements are also stipulated in these building codes based on site location. A detailed design of cavity walls is not covered in this Technical Notes. For design aids and examples of design procedures, several books listed in the REFERENCES section should be consulted [5, 7].

While the increase of health care treatments and procedures performed abroad involves many elective procedures (Woodman 2010; Synder, Dharamsi and Crooks 2011, Milstein and Smith 2007), which many U.S. health insurers deny payment, there is a growing interest by U.S. health care insurers to pay for more expensive complex procedures, such as Coronary Arterial Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery. Coronary bypass surgery, one of the most common cardiac surgical procedures performed, serves as a “cash cow” for many U.S. hospitals (Crowley 2010). Because cardiac surgery procedures provide high revenue, smaller local hospitals can market as offering a high-profile program in cardiac care even if the hospital has a low volume of bypass cases, thereby increasing patient volume and revenue (Regenbogen, Gust, Birkmeyer 2012). Focusing on coronary bypass, a review of Medicare data (1992 – 2003) demonstrates a decline in coronary bypass surgical procedures from 1992 to 2003, while the number of hospitals performing these surgeries steadily increased (Wilson, et al. 2007). Using Nationwide Inpatient Sample data (2001 – 2008), a study by Epstein et al (2011) supports Wilson’s et al review, demonstrating a decrease in the number of coronary bypass surgeries per hospital, yet a 12% increase in the number of hospitals during this period. In an effort to lure Americans to seek care abroad, coronary bypass procedures have become one of several expensive health care procedures offered by larger health care facilities in India, Singapore, and Thailand. This paper focuses on examining the growing interest of U.S. individuals, employers, and health insurance providers for having coronary bypass performed in India, Thailand, or Singapore.

1 Reports of resistance to a given agent occurring in an area does not necessarily mean that occurrence is frequent enough to pose a significant public health risk. Bold “Y” indicates agents to which significant resistance occurs in a given area (although actual risk may be highly focal, e.g. South-East Asia, where MQ resistance, while very frequent in some limited areas, is infrequent or absent in most others). Regular “Y” indicates that, while resistance to agent has been reported, it is not believed to occur frequently enough to pose a significant public health risk.

Misdiagnosis is the subject of a growing number of studies. The most recent one, Improving Diagnosis in Healthcare from the Institute of Medicine (IOM), explores the findings of many of these studies and notes that each year, approximately 12 million people in the U.S. who seek outpatient medical care experience some form of diagnostic error1. Another Johns Hopkins study found that out of 6,000 cases from medical institutions across the country, one out of every 71 cancer cases was misdiagnosed and up to one out of five cancers were misclassified, errors which can result in delayed or inappropriate treatment.2

samples)) / (geometric mean cpm of no drug samples). Percentage reductions are used to plot percentage inhibition of growth as a function of drug concentrations. IC 50 values are determined by linear regression analyses on the linear segments of the curves (IC 90 values can also be determined by curve-fitting and can provide an useful measure of variation between experiments). Assays are typically repeated on two or three separate occasions. Within each experiment, standard deviations are typically less than 10% of the mean. Differences in parasite stages of development can lead to up to two-fold shifts in the IC 50 values between experiments; however, these differences rarely affect the overall relationships between the parasite lines in terms of their differences in drug response 4-11 .

“Insomnia” has been used in different contexts to refer to either a symptom or a specific disorder. In this guideline, an insomnia disorder is defined as a subjective report of difficulty with sleep initiation, duration, consolidation, or quality that oc- curs despite adequate opportunity for sleep, and that result in some form of daytime impairment (Table 2). Except where otherwise noted, the word “insomnia” refers to an insomnia disorder in this guideline. Insomnia disorders have been categorized in various ways in different sleep disorder classification systems. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2) is used as the basis for insomnia classification in this guideline. The ICSD-2 identifies insomnia as one of eight major categories of sleep disorders and, within this group, lists twelve specific in- somnia disorders (Table 3).

Continuing to play immediately following a concussion is a risk for increased symptom burden, worsening of the injury and prolonged recovery.92–95 Athletes who return to sport prior to full recovery are at increased risk of repeat concussion.96 Some research has demonstrated that athletes who return to sport after SRC following standard return to sport protocols had an increased rate of musculoskeletal injury.97 98 The ‘Second Impact Syndrome’ is both rare and controversial. It is considered by some to be a potentially life-threatening complication of reinjury during the initial postinjury time period that is not fully under- stood and appears primarily limited to paediatric and adolescent athletes.99 (C)

prostate cancer primarily affects older men in whom the disease has less impact on indirect costs, such as productivity loss. While it is also important to consider end-of-life costs associated with prostate cancer, there are limited end-of-life cost data in the literature (e.g. the costs of palliative care, nursing homes, etc.). Furthermore, investigating the impact of the physical and mental suffering both patients and relatives endure during prostate cancer

medicine when following up n candidate molecules. The numerical solutions for this equation show that at least 48 molecules are to be evaluated for this probability to exceed 90%. The MMV discovery portfolio was built and funded to deliver two new preclinical candidates per year, and allowing for a third molecule coming from else- where, then this would still require some 16 years’ invest- ment per combination, except if there is a considerable increase in success rates going forwards (and a justifica- tion for this), or significantly increased investment. The hope on the horizon is that many of the new molecules are first-in-class, and so should they fail in clinical devel- opment there will be scope for well-defined back-up pro- jects, and these are normally much more cost-effective programmes. The definition of new molecular targets also opens up new possibilities for engaging the wider research community, allowing access to resources such as the EU’s European Lead Factory, which considers molec- ular targets but not phenotypic approaches.

Beta blockers also exhibit some benefit with regard to alcohol and drug abuse. The abuse of alcohol, prescription drugs, and illegal drugs (e.g., opioids, opiates, and cocaine) are major mental health care concerns. The repetitive abuse of these chemicals can produce physiologic dependence, tolerance, addiction, and neurologic damage. The symptoms of sudden withdrawal depend upon the abused substance, the impairment of neurological and neuroendocrine pathways, as well as somatic organ impairment. The withdrawal from addictive substances produces an array of symptoms, many of which overlap with the symptoms of panic and acute anxiety episodes. Delirium tremens (DTs) occur in some alcoholics upon abrupt cessation of drinking. The symptoms of alcohol-related DTs are very similar to those of panic attacks, and are in part related to beta adrenergic effects. The DTs can have serious and even life- threatening consequences. The standards-of-care for DTs are oral benzodiazepines. Withdrawal from opioid and/or opiate addiction is physiologically distinct from alcohol withdrawal.

Incidentally, when you write a paper, you can expect most reviewers (and readers) to make only one pass over it. Take care to choose coherent section and sub-section titles and to write concise and comprehensive abstracts. If a reviewer cannot understand the gist after one pass, the paper will likely be rejected; if a reader cannot understand the high- lights of the paper after five minutes, the paper will likely never be read.

Dear Parent(s) or Guardian(s): Each year, we are required by law to notify you of your child’s proficiency level in English. We must also provide you with the school’s recommendation for program placement and describe all available program options. This letter also explains how we decide when a student is ready to exit the English learner program. (20 United States Code 7012 and 6312[g][1][A]; California Education Code Section 48985; and Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations Section 11309[a][b][1]) Your child’s current English proficiency level is _________________________________, according to their most recent California English Language Development Test (CELDT) results. begineer

Restoring the health of the housing market is a necessary part of a broader strategy for economic recovery. There has been much discussion about the pathway forward, and the Federal Reserve has received questions and requests for our input and assistance. We have been looking at these issues and in the interest of continuing a dialogue, my staff has written a white paper, entitled "The U.S. Housing Market: Current Conditions and Policy Considerations." In this report, we do not attempt to address every problem faced by the housing market; rather, it is our intention to provide a framework for thinking about certain issues and tradeoffs that policymakers might consider.

Precast hollow-core concrete planks generally bear on the interior wythe of a cavity wall. The plank rests a minimum of 3 in. (75 mm) on a bearing pad that separates the plank from a concrete masonry bond beam below. Anchorage to the wall may be achieved with reinforcing steel (see Fig. 22) or, when lateral loads are small, planks may be solidly grouted to the wall. In either case, connections should be designed by a structural engineer.

□ Alternative Program (Alt): Transitional Bilingual Education: Students with an approved Parental Exception Waiver* receive core instruction initially through their primary language and instruction in ELD from trained and authorized teachers using district-adopted textbooks and supplementary instructional materials. Instruction is based on ELD and grade-level standards. With the goal of English Proficiency, in addition to mastery of core content, the language in which academic subjects are taught gradually shifts from students’ first language to English in order to make academic progress and meet the requirements to be reclassified as fluent English proficient (FEP). Parents may request specific program details for the alternative program at each school site.

example, be difficult for a factorial experi- mental design with several treatment combi- nations and dependent variables. An estimate of the SD could be obtained from a previous study, from the literature, or from a pilot study. However, all these sources of informa- tion are subject to error. The significance level is usually set, somewhat arbitrarily, at 0.05, and the power is likewise often set at 80(cid:150)90%. Thus, although doing a power analysis is a useful exercise in showing the potential capa- bility of various proposed experiments to detect an effect of biological interest, it does not always give a definitive answer of the most appropriate size of each experiment. It is strongly recommended, therefore, that sam- ple sizes are continually reviewed as experi- mental results become available.

3H-hypoxanthine (which is taken up by the parasite for purine salvage and DNA synthesis) to determine the level ofP.falciparum growth inhibition.In most applica- tions,parasites are cultured in the presence ofdifferent concentrations of test compound in media containing reduced concentrations of hypoxanthine,after which 3H-hypoxanthine is added for an additional incuba- tion period before cell harvesting and measurement of radioactive counts. IC 50values can be determined by linear regression analyses on the linear segments of the dose–response curves. Although 3H-hypoxanthine incorporation is the most commonly used method to assay antimalarial activity in vitro,it is costly,radioactive and quite com- plex,and therefore problematic for resource-poor loca- tions or for high-throughput screening (HTS,reviewed in REF. 51). A low-cost alternative for testing small numbers ofcompounds is to incubate parasites with test compounds (typically for 48 or 72 hours),and then to compare parasitaemias oftreated and control parasites by counting GIEMSA-stained parasites by light microscopy. Another established,but less standardized,assay involves the colorimetric detection of lactate dehydrogenase52. Flow cytometry has also been used to test candidate anti- malarial compounds,and takes advantage ofthe fact that human erythrocytes lack DNA.In the simplest use ofthis technology, parasites are fixed after the appropriate period ofincubation with test compounds,then either the parasitized cells are stained with hydroethidine (which is metabolized to ethidium53) or the parasite nuclei are stained with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2- phenylindole).Counts oftreated and control cultures are then obtained by flow cytometry.Appropriate gating can

Reinforced brick masonry (RBM) lintels may be built in place or prefabricated. The advantages of using RBM lintels are numerous, but include more efficient use of materials and exposed brick rather than steel at the top of the opening. RBM lintel design procedures are given in Technical Notes 17H. Loose steel angle lintels are the most prevalent means of support. For this reason, Table 1 gives recommended steel angle dimensions. If opening sizes other than those listed in Table 1 are used, information found in Technical Notes 31B Revised can be used for design of the loose steel angle lintel.

Other building materials expand and contract at rates different from that of brick masonry. These differences are important when elements such as window frames, railings, or copings are attached to brick masonry. Distress may occur in either material. Bowing may occur in composite walls that have con- crete masonry interior wythes.

The increase in full-text downloads for open access articles during their first year after publication suggests that the primary benefit to the nonsubscriber commu- nity is in browsing, as opposed to printing or saving, which would have been indicated by a commensurate increase in PDF downloads. The decrease in abstract views suggests a reader preference for the full docu- ment when available.

Dental pain A recent review article in the Journal of the American Dental Association addressing the treatment of dental pain following wisdom tooth extraction concluded that 325 mg of acetaminophen (APAP) taken with 200 mg of ibuprofen provides better pain relief than oral opioids. Moore et al. concluded, “The results of the quantitative systematic reviews indicated that the ibuprofen-APAP combination may be a more effective analgesic, with fewer untoward effects, than are many of the currently available opioid-containing formulations.” (Moore, 2013, p. 898)

The factors underlying these metrics merit closer atten- tion. The increased stringency of review of projects at the lead and preclinical candidate stages means that the quality of compounds is theoretically improving, so future success rates may be underestimated [112]. Of the 16 molecules entering preclinical development from the MMV portfolio since 2009, only four have been aban- doned, with six moving successfully to phase I, and a fur- ther seven working their way through safety studies, with four new phase I starts expected in 2017. As Fig. 3 with plots for Eq. 1 shows, doubling the success rate for indi- vidual candidate molecules (from 8 to 16%) more than halves the number that need to be evaluated. One area for possible improvement is the success rate in phase III,

We present results on three tasks. The first two tasks are ranking ones. In task one, we attempt to learn to rank lists of scientific articles grouped by day. In task two, we per- form the same task, but on lists of scientific articles grouped by week. For task three, we consider the binary task of dif- ferentiating between scientific articles with real coverage and those with coverage only from press release issuers and copiers.

In the late 1800s, Andrew Taylor Still identified the neuromusculoskeletal system as the key element in health maintenance and stressed preventive aspects of medi- cine in place of drug therapy. During that time, osteop- athy was truly separate and distinct from the world of allo- pathic medicine. Since then, as medicine in general has become more evidence-based and supported by research, osteopathic philosophy has evolved into a more complete and robust osteopathic medicine. The phrase “osteopathic medicine” is now the accepted term for the profession over “osteopathy,” a now-antiquated term that represents a period when Still championed a near-drugless form of manual medicine. Since its conception, osteopathic med- icine has adapted its body of knowledge to incorporate contemporary scientific thought, including germ theory, pharmacology, and other “allopathic” teachings. The cen- tral tenets of osteopathic thought, however, have been maintained and continue to guide DOs in their practice of medicine. Though interprofessional relations between MDs and DOs are better than they have ever been before, challenges still exist in terms of keeping the osteopathic tradition intact, improving the evidence basis of OMM via clinical research, and advocating for widespread recogni- tion of DOs.

More particularly, the City understands that Archbishop Cordileone informed all parishes and other worship sites in the Archdiocese, including San Francisco, that they could resume public Mass on Sunday, June 14, 2020. Upon learning of this direction to the parishes my office sent the Archdiocese an email on Thursday, June 11, 2020 (attached) seeking more information and making sure that the Archdiocese was aware of the San Francisco Health Officer’s determination that indoor services with congregants continue to pose a serious public health risk and are consequently prohibited under the Health Order for the time being, with a narrow exception for funerals with 12 or fewer persons and an exception for live streaming services with

In addition to return to learning and sporting environments, older athletes may need to return to driving, where subtle defi- cits could compromise safety. Most sports medicine physicians do not counsel athletes with SRC about driving.90 Driving is a complex process involving coordination of cognitive, visual and motor skills, as well as concentration, attention, visual percep- tion, insight and memory, which can all be affected by SRC.90 Little is known about the risk of driving after SRC, but prelim- inary data suggest some impairment exists when patients with concussion report they are asymptomatic.91 Currently, no widely

level, on average. As seen in Table 3, this problem is harder, with the best performance on the daily task at 0.6065, using all features, and 0.6156 on the weekly task at rank 7, using all features. However, although harder, this problem may be more realis- tic since, as noted in the introduction, many journalists start with press materials to inform what science they cover be- fore reading original articles. Table 6 displays the top 20 fea- tures for the daily experiment using all features. Important features for these experiments are similar to those listed for the experiments including all scientific articles, except fea- tures from the press release are more prevalent. This makes sense as press releases were issued for all articles in this sub- set (and we have the text of most of them), and press releases are an important source text for journalists. We do not list features from the weekly experiments as they are quite sim- ilar.
