Patients who reported any cancer diagnosis, physician-administered chemotherapy, or radiation therapy treatment in the 12 months preceding the date of diagnosis were removed from the analysis. Codes used to identify radiation therapy and physician-administered chemotherapy can be found in the Appendix. Patients identified as having lung, colorectal, or breast cancer in 2011 are included in the study. Males with breast cancer were excluded. Some patients were identified as having multiple cancers. These patients were assigned according to the following hierarchy:

Patients were followed from 2010 through 2014 or until their departure from the data, whichever occurred first. Patients were followed for months of coverage under a COBRA or disabled status reported under the same membership ID. The data does not include a reason for disenrollment; patients could leave because of death, loss of subscriber’s employment, change of plan (including entering Medicare), turning age 65, or long-term disability.
