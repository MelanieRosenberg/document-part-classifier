A further measure that may reduce medicine price is tax reduction or exemption. Medicines may be subject to different taxes in countries that consider medicines like other consumer goods for the purpose of taxation. These include the application of import tariffs and value-added tax (VAT) (Table 3.4, p.43). Countries that are signatories to the reciprocal Pharmaceutical Tariff Elimination Agreement, or the “zero- for-zero” initiative, have 0% tariff (198). The zero-for-zero initiative has extended to some non-signatory countries, including low- and middle-income countries. Some countries have also implemented tax exemption specifically targeting cancer medicines. For example, from May 2018, the Government of China has exempted import tariffs on common medicines, including 16 cancer medicines (199). Such initiatives would require concurrent enforcement efforts to ensure that any savings from tax reduction or exemption are directly transferred to service providers or patients.

Many countries continue to apply tariffs on imported medicines, access to medicines (198). Many countries also apply VAT to medicines, although VAT rates are generally reduced for medicines compared to the standard tax rates (200). Nonetheless, VAT can make medicines unaffordable while not substantially contributing to revenue goals (e.g. ≈1% of public revenue) (198,201).

<TEXT>
In countries with pricing regulations, authorities may monitor and revise medicine prices according to changing market conditions and therapeutic landscape. The most commonly employed method is revision of medicine prices upon the loss of market exclusivity of a product (Table 3.5). For example, through an agreement with the pharmaceutical industry, the Australian Government has set rules for reducing the
