Identification:                                                       Prevention:
 Use  photos  and  descriptions for preliminary identification        • Do not clean brickwork  with unbuffered  hydrochloric (muri-
 of efflorescence  or stains                                           atic) acid
 When   uncertain  of correct identification of efflorescence or      • Use cleaning  agent or procedure  recommended     by  brick
 stain, have  experienced  brick personnel  or professionals           manufacturer   to prevent cleaning-related  stains
 verify prior to cleaning                                             • Store brick off ground and cover  with non-staining water-
                                                                       proof material
                                                                      • Protect top of unfinished brickwork from  weather

INTRODUCTION
</SECTION_HEADER>
<TEXT>
Brick has been used to create beautiful buildings for centuries. Most of these structures have a substantial history of outstanding performance. In some instances the appearance is affected by the development of efflorescence or stains. These may originate from materials in the brick or mortar, from adjacent materials, and from outside sourc- es such as cleaning agents. Each has a particular chemical composition and a unique means of removal.

Identification of the origin of the efflorescence, stain or foreign material is the first step in returning brickwork to its proper appearance. Some stains are often misidentified or are mistaken for efflorescence. Since correctly identify- ing efflorescence or a stain can be difficult, it is recommended that experienced brick personnel or professionals verify the efflorescence or type of stain. Misidentification may result in application of an inappropriate correction method. When correctly identified, efflorescence and stains can generally be removed. Inappropriate correction methods may result in further staining or damage of the brickwork.

Efflorescence
</SECTION_HEADER>
<TEXT>
Efflorescence is normally a harmless deposit of water- soluble, white salt crystals, as shown in Photo 1. In some instances efflorescence may appear on mortar joints as shown in Photo 2. Efflorescence may appear in limited areas on the surface of brickwork as shown in Photo 3 or, in extreme cases, cover the entire brickwork surface.
