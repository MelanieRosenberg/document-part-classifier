Clinicians should individualise adjustments based on patient-specific symptoms, symptom severity, academic demands, as well as pre-existing conditions, such as mood disorder, learning disability or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.87 88 Athletes with complicated or prolonged recovery may require a multidisciplinary team with specific expertise across the scope of concussion management.

return-to-sport progression is individualised and is a function of the injury, the athlete’s age, prior SRC and level of play, and the ability to provide close supervision during the return to activity. The return-to-sport progression presented by the CISG is widely accepted but empiric, without evidence to support either the progression sequence or the time spent in each stage. In general, for young athletes, each stage of the progression should be at least 24 hours without return of symptoms before progressing to the next stage. (C)

In addition to return to learning and sporting environments, older athletes may need to return to driving, where subtle defi- cits could compromise safety. Most sports medicine physicians do not counsel athletes with SRC about driving.90 Driving is a complex process involving coordination of cognitive, visual and motor skills, as well as concentration, attention, visual percep- tion, insight and memory, which can all be affected by SRC.90 Little is known about the risk of driving after SRC, but prelim- inary data suggest some impairment exists when patients with concussion report they are asymptomatic.91 Currently, no widely

Continuing to play immediately following a concussion is a risk for increased symptom burden, worsening of the injury and prolonged recovery.92–95 Athletes who return to sport prior to full recovery are at increased risk of repeat concussion.96 Some research has demonstrated that athletes who return to sport after SRC following standard return to sport protocols had an increased rate of musculoskeletal injury.97 98 The ‘Second Impact Syndrome’ is both rare and controversial. It is considered by some to be a potentially life-threatening complication of reinjury during the initial postinjury time period that is not fully under- stood and appears primarily limited to paediatric and adolescent athletes.99 (C)

Return-to-sport progressions should be individualised based on the injury, athlete’s age, history and level of play, and the ability to provide close supervision during the return to activity, and progressions may vary between athletes. Each stage is generally 24 hours without return of concussion symptoms. Consider written clearance from a healthcare professional before return to sport as directed by local laws and regulations.3

Mental health problems and depression Sport and exercise are protective against depression.100 Most studies examining the relationship of contact sports to mental health problems or depression later in life have low methodolog- ical quality, high risk of bias or both.101–103 Several studies have reported that NFL and college football athletes with a history of concussion are more likely to experience depression, although the risk of mental health issues, including suicide, among former NFL players is lower than age-matched controls.101–103 Former high school football players show no difference in cognitive func- tion testing and have lower depression scores when compared with non-contact sport controls.104 Mental health issues are common, multifactorial and often present independent of partic- ipation in contact or collision sport. Longitudinal research on contact sport athletes that addresses multiple variables is needed to understand the long-term risks. (C)
