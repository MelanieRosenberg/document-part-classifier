Proper Sizing-Firebox dimensions should be selected so that the fire fills the combustion chamber during operation. This provides greater heating efficiency. Careful consideration should be given to size of the fireplace opening best suited for the room in which it is to be located. Location and size are important not only from the standpoint of appearance, but also of operation. If the fireplace opening is too small, it may function properly but will not produce enough heat to warm the room. If the opening is too large, a fire that would fill the combustion chamber may overwhelm the room. In such a case, the firebox opening would require a larger flue area and consume larger amounts of interior air even if exterior combustion air is provided. Table 2 provides suggested widths of conventional fireplace openings appropriate for various room sizes. For example, a room with 300 ft2 (28 m2) of floor area is best served by a fireplace with an opening 30 in. (750 mm) to 36 in. (900 mm) wide.

Brick arches usually require no steel reinforcement and are an attractive option. When determining the height of a fireplace opening which incorporates an arch use the maximum height to the arch soffit. Information on arch design may be found in Technical Notes 31 Series.

Reinforced brick masonry (RBM) lintels may be built in place or prefabricated. The advantages of using RBM lintels are numerous, but include more efficient use of materials and exposed brick rather than steel at the top of the opening. RBM lintel design procedures are given in Technical Notes 17H. Loose steel angle lintels are the most prevalent means of support. For this reason, Table 1 gives recommended steel angle dimensions. If opening sizes other than those listed in Table 1 are used, information found in Technical Notes 31B Revised can be used for design of the loose steel angle lintel.
