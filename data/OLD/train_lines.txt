Unfortunately, and contrary to increasing medical evidence that religious services without safeguards have caused serious outbreaks in many other cities and counties throughout the country, the Archdiocese has conducted both indoor and outdoor gatherings over the past three weekends that violate the Health Order and jeopardize the health and safety of San Franciscans. These large gatherings of people indoors for a long period, in some instances reported without face coverings and with singing, place clergy, staff, volunteers and congregants alike at heightened risk of transmission of COVID-19, which can lead to serious illness and even death, and endangers the health of the Archdiocese’s parishioners and the entire community. Given the recent rise in cases and hospitalizations, Dr. Aragón’s concerns about these risks have only been heightened.

The general view of the ex- perimental parts made of poly- meric-composite material CCPA- 6-30 is shown in Fig. 9 We have developed meth- ods for heat treatment in oils, which make it impossible to hy- groscopic PKM based on aliphatic polyamides in volumes that led to a change in geometric dimensions or changes in properties.

Radcliff et al. looked at patients who received opioids initially for treatment of lumbar disc herniation compared with those who did not. They found that those receiving opioids had a higher rate of surgery and that, overall, there was no significant difference four years later. Opioid medications were associated with an increased crossover to surgical treatment. Four years after the initiation of treatment, 16 percent of those who received opioids at the start were still on opioids, whereas only 5 percent of those who were treated with non-opioids initially were on opioids after four years. They concluded that those who were initially treated with opioids had a higher rate of surgery and a greater chance of being on opioids four years later but no significant change in overall outcome (Radcliff et al., 2013).

A temporary grade of Incomplete (I) may be given if a student’s work has been satisfactory throughout the term but, due to extenuating circumstances, the student needs additional time to complete the remaining assignments. In this context, extenuating circumstances include non-academic factors beyond the student’s control that make it impossible to continue: severe illness, death in the immediate family, drastic change in work or financial situation, or other unusual and extreme situations as deemed appropriate by the instructor. It is the student’s responsibility to request the incomplete grade in writing prior to the close of the academic term. If the instructor grants the request, the instructor and student must promptly complete, sign, and submit the Incomplete Grade Contract to the Education Office. The contract specifies (1) all assignments yet to be completed, (2) the date(s) by which the remaining work is to be submitted to the instructor, and (3) the default grade if the student received no points for missing work. Incomplete grades must be resolved by the agreed-upon time in the contract, which should be no later than that last day of next regular academic term. If the work is not completed by that time, the default grade listed on the form will become the final grade, or an F if no grade is indicated. Only the rarest of situations will warrant additional extensions, and they require the expressed approval of the department chair.

In 2010 the German government passed the Pharmaceutical Market Restructuring Act, or Arzneimittelmarkt- Neuordnungsgesetz (AMNOG), to regulate drug prices. AMNOG went into effect in 2011, and the legal process attempts to balance paying for innovative drug development with making decisions based on clinical efficacy.

Identification of the origin of the efflorescence, stain or foreign material is the first step in returning brickwork to its proper appearance. Some stains are often misidentified or are mistaken for efflorescence. Since correctly identify- ing efflorescence or a stain can be difficult, it is recommended that experienced brick personnel or professionals verify the efflorescence or type of stain. Misidentification may result in application of an inappropriate correction method. When correctly identified, efflorescence and stains can generally be removed. Inappropriate correction methods may result in further staining or damage of the brickwork.

An advantage of a power analysis is that it can be used to explore the implications of negative results, i.e. those in which there is no significant difference between treatment means. Such negative results might be of bio- logical interest, particularly in safety testing, if they are real, but are of little interest if the lack of statistical significance was because the experiment was too small to detect a treatment difference of potential interest. Thus, a power analysis can be used to find out the probability that the experiment would have been able to detect a specified treatment effect if it was really there. For example, in the diet experiment discussed previously, suppose that an experiment had been undertaken to compare the two diets with ten mice per group, and that the mean

Brick masonry exhibits superior thermal mass, that is, the ability to store and slowly release heat at a later time. These properties help shift the peak heating or cooling loads to off-peak times and reduce the peak temperatures. Current energy codes take thermal mass into account by requiring a lower R-value for mass walls, such as brick cavity walls (see Technical Notes 4B).

6. Identify the efflorescence. Knowing the composition of efflorescing salts is sometimes of use. Table 1, taken from Brownell’s report lists the most probable sources of efflorescing salts. Commercial testing laboratories can use X-ray diffraction, petrographic analysis or chemical analysis can, in some instances, determine both the type of salts present and their relative quantity. 7. Consider miscellaneous sources of water when all obvious sources have been eliminated. Some of these sources are: condensation within the wall, poorly directed landscape sprinklers, leaky pipes, faulty drains and condensation on heating or plumbing pipes. If necessary, condensation analysis methods are described in Technical Note 47.

Unsynchronized versus synchronized cultures.For pre- liminary screening of diverse compounds, the less demanding (but less sensitive) method ofusing unsyn- chronized cultures is widely used. SYNCHRONIZEDCULTURES are used when comparing a series ofcompounds,estab- lishing rank order ofactivities and determining potency against different parasite stages54.

Duration ofincubation.Most assays incorporate incu- bation with test compounds for 48 hours,the duration of one erythrocytic cycle. Incubations can also be extended to 72 hours or longer.This can generate more reproducible IC 50values when working with unsyn- chronized cultures and is important when testing slower-acting compounds such as antibiotics.

The structural design of cavity walls should follow either rational or empirical methods. The rational design method is based on the properties of the wall materials and engineering analysis. This method may be used for any structure where high loads are likely or where tall walls are a necessity. The empirical method is generally satisfactory for one and two-story buildings consisting of light construction with limited floor spans and wall heights; and for multistory buildings where unsupported wall heights are not excessive.

Table 11. Cancer site abbreviations in column 1 are the same as in Table 3. Column 2 = mean estimated spending based on [NCI, 2017b] (which uses the “head-and-neck” nomenclature for Oral = oral cavity and pharynx cancer), and column 3 = standard deviation (see Subsection 6.2). Column 4 = number of estimated new incidences as reported in [ACS, 2017] and [Siegel et al, 2017]. Column 5 = estimated per-new-incidence spending. The factors (column 6) and rate (column 7) are taken from Table 10 for breast, colorectal, lung and prostate cancers and melanoma (bold font). For other cancer sites the factor is extrapolated from the values in Table 10 (italicized font) and rate is taken from Table 3 (regular font) or extrapolated therefrom (italicized font). See Subsection 6.1. The relative cost-savings (column 8) are obtained via Eq. (12) and Eq. (13), and cost-savings from early diagnosis (column 9) via Eq. (15), where the factor is set to 1 for all cancer sites except breast cancer, for which .

For this reason the level of care which can reasonably be expected at a primary care centre is significantly lower than that available at a tertiary care hospital. Nevertheless, some capacity to provide emergency careshouldbeavailableateverylevelofacountry’shealthcare system. A health care facility’s capacity is determined by both human and structural factors. Human factors include the number and mix of health care workers and their level of training.Structuralfactorsincludespace,medications,supplies and specialized equipment.

Secondly, a major limitation of targeted cancer medicines is the occurrence of treatment resistance which can result in a lack of response (termed intrinsic resistance) or partial or loss of responses over time (termed acquired resistance) (80). Clinically, this means that patients may experience prolonged progression- free survival, but not improved overall survival. While researchers continue to unravel the complex mechanisms of and mitigation strategies for treatment resistance, it is important to recognize that the use of single targeted therapies may not have durable treatment effects in clinical practice. Furthermore, while the use of targeted therapies in combination may in theory mitigate the emergence of treatment resistance (81), safety consideration either preclude the use of such combination, or compromise the doses at which individual agents could be used in combination, which might in turn lower its efficacy (82). Outcomes observed in clinical trials may not translate into benefits for patients in clinical practice

Some chemotherapy and targeted therapy drugs may cause skin problems, including redness, blistering, itching, peeling, dryness, rashes, acne, and sensitivity to the sun. Some targeted therapy drugs can also cause an extensive rash over the face, neck, and chest. Most of these skin problems go away after treatment is fin- ished, but symptoms of an allergic reaction, including sudden or severe itching, rash, or hives, should be reported right away. Radiation may cause skin to become red, irritated, and swollen, which might worsen to become blistered, peeling, or even open sores. Most skin reactions to radiation slowly go away after treatment, although skin may remain darker than it was before.

The basic concept of the course is that the students should learn from the real examples and on their own mistakes. In most of the cases, participants were analysing and correcting each-others work. In other cases, participants were making comments on examples prepared by Ian Cressie. Typical exercise was, for example: a short RA is given to students who have to write a missing abstract respecting the rules and functions of an abstract.

We used an expert provided list of 42 relevant domain terms for the Myocardial Perfusion Imaging domain (a sub-domain of nuclear cardiology) to heuristically test the coverage of our ontology terms. Of these, we found 31 exactly matching terms, 2 morphological variants and 8 phrases that contained the terms from the expert list. Out of this 42 domain terms, 1 term, ‘dyperidamole’, was not found in our ontology (dyperidamole is a drug given during pregnancy). We found that this term didn’t exist in the 618 JNC abstracts we were using. Instead, another term, diperidamole (spelling variant) existed in our term list. To do away with noise in our data, we selected terms with greater than average frequency (2.9) of the 10191 retrieved terms and set that as our threshold. We pruned the list to

One can reasonably assert that this beneficial anxiolytic effect might have been enhanced even further under three study design conditions. First, if the inclusion criteria had required each patient to have a high anxiety score prior to the procedure, for instance a minimum of 7 points (with 10 as the maximum), there would have been a greater potential for a difference pre-treatment vs. during the procedure. The six responders had a baseline average of 6.3 points, so there was room for improvement. Of the six responders, two subjects had low baseline anxiety scores (i.e., patient F at 4 points and patient I at 2 points). A higher baseline inclusion parameter could have increased the differential prior to vs. during the EMG procedure. Second, there might not have been a sufficiently long waiting period between the drug administration and the procedure. One can reasonably assert that if the time interval between dosing and the procedure was increased to a minimum of 30 minutes or more (from the 10 – 20 minutes), the percentage of responders and the magnitude of the response could have been greater. However, it should be noted that often in a clinic time-is-of-the-essence between the patient’s initial assessment by the medical provider and the subsequent medical procedure. Some medical providers are willing to pre-treat an anxious patient, typically with an oral benzodiazepine either swallowed intact or pre-dissolved in water, and then have him/her wait (e.g., 30 + min.) for an anxiolytic effect to be acknowledged by the patient. But, some physicians and dentists might be under time constraints or might not be willing to oblige the patient this waiting period. This would not be an obstacle if either the drug has a rapid onset of effect or the patient were to pre-treat themselves immediately prior to arrival at the physician’s office, for instance 30-60 minutes in advance. Even under the conditions of this study that the authors consider might have been sub-optimal, this drug combo delivered by the oral mucosal route provided a rapid onset effect as a PRN medication. This anxiolytic benefit may be useful in treating anticipatory anxiety either in-office or prior to arrival. There is a third limitation to this study to consider. The compounded medicine contained 25 mg of atenolol and 0.2 mg of scopolamine HBr.

For the (2 vs. 2) SVM schema, one can observe from Table 6 that the highest overall accuracy is 0.91 and generated by a feature combination of POS-based unigrams and K-array semantics-based sequential features, regardless of whether WordNet is used to correct the POS of a unigram or not. In terms of the kernel functions, a linear kernel is used at the first level of the SVM model and a polynomial kernel at the second level. In addition, we notice that the inclusion of bigrams (the last four rows in Table 6) does not improve accuracy but rather reduce the accuracy. This agrees with results reported in previous studies. Tables 7 and 8 present the confusion matrices resulted from the two best feature sets using the (2 vs. 2) SVM schema. These two tables elaborate the two optimal feature sets as highlighted in Table 6. Results are obtained by using a linear and a polynomial kernel at the two levels respectively and averaged over 10-fold cross validation. Notice that in certain cases, the model cannot ditinguish between positive and neutral polarities due to the reasons discussed above; while negative and no-relationship can often be correctly identified.

In view of the clinical studies and off-label use of various beta blockers, psychiatrists are aware that beta blockers can provide some symptomatic relief with regard to performance anxiety [53]. However, beta blockers alone do not sufficiently address the aggregate symptoms of panic and acute anxiety episodes, and especially the psychic symptoms thereof (e.g., fear, avoidance, and anxiousness).

The essential feature of this disorder is insomnia caused by a coexisting medical disorder or other physiological factor. Although insomnia is commonly associated with many medi- cal conditions, this diagnosis should be used when the insomnia causes marked distress or warrants separate clinical attention. This diagnosis is not used to explain insomnia that has a course independent of the associated medical disorder, and is not routinely made in individu- als with the “usual” severity of sleep symptoms for an associated medical disorder. These two diagnoses are used for insomnia disorders that cannot be classified elsewhere but are suspected to be related to underlying mental disorders, psychological factors, behaviors, medical disorders, physiological states, or substance use or exposure. These diagnoses are typically used when further evaluation is required to identify specific associated conditions, or when the patient fails to meet criteria for a more specific disorder.

The goals of treatment are to “cure” the cancer, if possible; pro- long survival; and provide the highest possible quality of life during and after treatment. A cancer is cured when all traces of the cancer have been removed from the patient’s body. Although it is usually not possible to know if the cancer is completely eradicated, for many patients, the initial course of therapy is successful and the cancer never returns. However, some cancer- free survivors must cope with the long-term effects of treatment, as well as psychological concerns such as fear of recurrence. Cancer patients, caregivers, and survivors must have the infor- mation and support they need to play an active role in decisions that affect treatment and quality of life.

Estimates include the full year of Medicare spending prior to and including the month of death, irrespective of when the patient was diagnosed. Spending estimates are based on Medicare fee-for-service patients only and are adjusted for inflation to 2013 dollars. For prostate cancer stages I and II are combined due to small numbers for stage I.

A recent analysis of US managed care data revealed similar costs for initial therapy in men with prostate cancer [ 18 ] . During the fi rst 2 years after diagnosis, the average total cost across all patients was $48 808, with $29 417 representing prostate cancer-related costs. Those patients receiving treatment incurred costs fi ve times higher than those undergoing watchful waiting ($38 945 vs $7595). The highest costs were incurred within the fi rst 3 months after diagnosis and decreased substantially over time. Among patients receiving initial treatment, surgery incurred costs of $31 666 with the majority attributable to inpatient costs ($26 539).

(cid:2) The panel recommends that clinicians offer multi- modal analgesia, or the use of a variety of analgesic medications and techniques combined with non- pharmacological interventions, for the treatment of postoperative pain in children and adults (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Multimodal analgesia, defined as the use of a variety of analgesic medication and techniques that target different mechanisms of action in the peripheral and/or central nervous system (which might also be combined with nonpharmacological interventions) might have ad- ditiveorsynergisticeffectsandmoreeffectivepainrelief compared with single-modality interventions. For example, clinicians might offer local anesthetic-based regional (peripheral and neuraxial) analgesic techniques in combination with systemic opioids and other analge- sics as part of a multimodal approach to perioperative pain. Because of the availability of effective nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies for postop- erative pain management, the panel suggests that clini- cians routinely incorporate around the clock nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies into multi- modal analgesia regimens. Systemic opioids might not be required in all patients. One study suggests that it shouldbeavoidedwhennotneeded,becauselimitedev- idence suggests that perioperative opioid therapy might be associated with increased likelihood of long-term opioid use, with its attendant risks.4

Second, deepening of institutional structure should be an ongoing project, particularly as it relates to bioethical codes (Baker, 2015; Tartzian et al., 2015), as well as proactive institutional engage- ment to improve responsiveness (Fenton et al., 2015). Institutional engagement with the future of the bioethics field is required to steward professionalism (White et al., 2014) and populate the health professions with those trained in bioethics, given radical changes in biomedical research and practice to come (Grady, 2013). This is particularly important given the rise of Big Data, as well as new biomedical methodologies such as crowdsourcing applied to biomedical research (Callaghan, 2014a; 2014b). Third, explicit engagement with issues relating to channels of communication around biotech de- velopments is needed, in order to ensure narratives are not ‘captured’ by those with agendas (O’Keefe et al., 2015) and validity of public knowledge is ensured through development of ap- propriate biomedicine vocabularies. These practical initiatives capture the spirit of citizen science theory (Bonney et al., 2009) in terms of increasing responsiveness of populations to issues which affect them, or democratisation of both scientific discovery and its scrutiny. Theory related to wicked problems, or problems at the nexus of human values and uncertainty (Rittel & Webber, 1973), together with citizen science theory may help bioethicists negotiate changes to come in the biomedical research landscape.

I understand that by signing this form, my school and I may lose valuable information about how well my student is progressing academically. As a result, my student will not receive an individual score. Refusing to participate in statewide assessments may impact the school, district, and state’s efforts to equitably distribute resources and support student learning; for the purpose of school and district accountability calculations, my student will not be considered “proficient.”

industry for anti-infectives overall, and significantly better than for other therapeutic areas, such as neurol- ogy and oncology. One difficulty with such an analysis is that new chemotypes have an inherently higher risk than additional members of established chemical classes, other than the risks of failure due to resistance (which are higher for drugs that have been used for many years). For this review’s new analysis (Table 8), new chemotypes are separated from life-cycle management projects. The overall success rates have not changed significantly in the last 3 years, either for MMV or for the CMR benchmark, which is reassuring. The data shows that a new molecule in formal preclinical evaluation has an 8% chance of becoming part of a product.

This step finds best matching concept from UMLS and assigns them to the domain phrase along with the match value. In order to find the conceptual match between the phrase and the possible concepts, the context map is used to find related phrases. These related phrases can map to a unique UMLS concept or many concepts. We look for related phrases with uniquely mapping concepts and then build a suffix tree for the concept hierarchy compute the conceptual distance [10] between the possible phrase concepts and the unique concept. The shortest distance between two concepts is computed by a spreading activation search on the UMLS hierarchy graph. Two concepts share a common concept in the graph. There may be several common concepts between two concepts (through various parents of these two concepts). The shortest path common concept links the closest matching concepts. This notion of conceptual similarity is based on the premise that “related terms in the context map are closely related to each other in the UMLS graph”.

The findings reported above seem to suggest that there are important differences in the rhetorical organi- zation of introductions in Brazilian Portuguese articles from The ESPecialist and articles from English for Specific Purposes. While the latter fits the proposed moves in the CARS model closely, the former has been shown to vary from it somewhat. It is worth noting that both journals specialize in the same subfield of Applied Linguistics, a claim supported not only by the names of these journals, but also by the similar editorial policies they hold (see Appendix C). Even though English for Specific Purposes reaches a wider inter- national readership by being published in English, the current academic lingua franca (Duszak & Lewkowicz, 2008), both journals started publication in the same year and can, therefore, be considered to have a similar level of maturity and tradition, at least in the eyes of the audience they reach. In this sense, the distinction made by Samraj (2005) between established fields and emerging fields of inquiry would not help explain the differences between the two sets of introductions analyzed in this study. It seems, thus, that the differences found would have to be attributed to cross-linguistic/cross-cultural reasons. The most striking difference between the BESP and the ESPj RAIs lies in the pervasive absence of Move 2 in the former. Other studies that looked at RAIs in languages other than English have found a similar pattern. As mentioned above, Jogthong (2001) reported an absence of Move 2 in 45% of the Thai articles studied while in Ahmad’s (1997) corpus of Malay RAIs 35% lacked a Move 2. In the present study, 70% of the RAIs in Portuguese did not contain this move, while only 10% of those in English lacked it.

From Table 6, one can observe that the positive polarity constantly has high accuracy for both methods as compared to the other polarities. One main reason we believe is that the annotated corpus has a large number of positive examples as shown in Table 4. We also observe that the “no-relationship” has a constantly high accuracy and is not influenced by other feature combinations. The reason behind this is that the unigrams found in the relationships that have “no relationship” polarity often contain unique negation terms such as “no” and ‘not”. Therefore unigrams alone are often sufficient. The accuracy of neutral relationships is low because neutral and positive relationships tend to contain

Propranolol is routinely delivered orally. Propranolol in Inderal® is available in oral doses ranging from 10 to 80 mg per dose for the treatment of hypertension. Multiple doses per day may be permitted. This drug can also be absorbed mucosally, as demonstrated by sublingual delivery [12], and its bioavailability is higher when absorbed by this route rather than orally [13,14]. Propranolol has been delivered sublingually at 10 and 40 mg per dose [12,13], although this can produce mouth paresthesia, an undesirable effect. Also, propranolol has been delivered by rectal administration in mammals [15]. It does not demonstrate chemical dependence or sedation that are common side effects of many psychiatric medications. Propranolol is prescribed for the treatment of various cardiovascular indications with FDA approval, most notably hypertension, arrhythmia, angina, as well as prophylaxis of migraines. However, there is evidence that it can have some benefit with regard to a subset of the symptoms of panic and anxiety disorders. The drug’s anxiolytic potential was recognized as early as 1966, “Emotions are expressed through the autonomic nervous system, and anxiety states are associated with increased secretion of catecholamines. Propranolol may therefore have a place in the treatment of anxiety, especially when the symptoms are related to the cardiovascular system [16].” This prescient comment five decades ago was subsequently validated by clinical studies with regard to both aspects: (a) propranolol and other beta blockers have been used “off label” in the USA for the near-term prophylaxis of performance anxiety; and (b) the pharmacologic benefits of propranolol and other beta blockers are restricted to the cardiovascular system’s effects per se. The evidence is provided below. The beneficial anxiolytic effects are limited to blocking the pharmacologic effects of catecholamines upon the cardiovascular system without addressing the psychic (CNS) symptoms or other somatic symptoms of acute anxiety and panic, with the possible exception of tremors. (Table 1) summarizes the relevant evidence from clinical investigations in the literature regarding beta blockers used to treat anxiety conditions. Daily oral propranolol has been demonstrated in one prophylactic study to suppress panic attacks in subjects diagnosed with panic disorder and agoraphobia [17]. Tyrer and Lader demonstrated some effectiveness of oral propranolol in treating somatic anxiety symptoms, but not psychic (mental) anxiety [18,19]. Another daily oral prophylactic study compared propranolol (3 x 80 mg/day) to oxprenolol (3 x 80 mg/day) and revealed that both beta blockers reduced symptoms of anxiety at one or two weeks duration [20]. Both treatments reduced heart rate; propranolol by ~ 21 - 32 bpm and oxprenolol by ~ 16 - 23 bpm. However, propranolol was more effective at reducing palpitations when assessed on day 7 compared to oxprenolol. Another study demonstrated that

warming or internet commerce” and the need for social and natural scientists to “forget about what separates them and start looking at those ‘things’ whose hybrid nature has, for many dec- ades now, already unified them in practice.” Arguably, the economic nature of human activity (represented by lines representing different streams of literature in Figure 1) has changed substan- tively on account of two revolutions in work practice, namely, the industrial and knowledge revo- lutions, which enabled radically enhanced productivity improvements and a sea change in social theory in their wake. It is suggested here that societal, business, and biomedical ethics are not in- dependent of these changes, and that the post-industrial paradigm, with its ethics premised on social theory developed in response to industrialisation, has been disrupted by a further productiv- ity revolution which has increased the returns to knowledge in production, and that divergence has occurred between ethical thought premised on industrialised logics and a new ethics based on exponential increases in the power of knowledge to generate social and scientific change.

Table 3 shows the accuracy of the results obtained by our unsupervised vector approach using the CUI→ST context description, SenseClusters, and the results reported by Humphrey et al. (2006). As seen with the context description results, there exists a large difference in accuracy on a word by word basis between the approaches. The results show that Humphrey et al. (2006) report a higher overall accuracy compared to SenseClusters and our approach. Although, Humphrey et al. (2006) per- formed better for 5 out of the 13 words where as SenseClusters performed better for 9. The unigram feature set with gap cluster stopping returned the highest overall accuracy for SenseClusters. The number of clusters for all of the gap cluster stopping experiments were two except for growth which re- turned one. For our approach, the unigram feature set returned the highest overall accuracy.

ability to sleep and the daytime consequences of poor sleep, dis- torted beliefs and attitudes about the origins and meaning of the insomnia, maladaptive efforts to accommodate to the condition (e.g., schedule or lifestyle changes), and excessive time spent awake in bed. The latter behavior is of particular significance in that it often is associated with “trying hard” to fall asleep and growing frustration and tension in the face of wakefulness. Thus, the bed becomes associated with a state of waking arousal as this conditioning paradigm repeats itself night after night.

veys, and frequent teleconference discussions, the expert panel identified consensus areas and recommendations for those areas not covered by AASM practice parameters. Recommendations were generated by panel members and discussed by all. To min- imize individual expert bias, the group anonymously voted and rated consensus recommendations from 1: strongly disagree to 9: strongly agree. Consensus was defined when all experts rated a recommendation 8 or 9. If consensus was not evident after the first vote, the consensus recommendations were discussed again, amended as appropriate, and a second anonymous vote was conducted. If consensus was not evident after the second vote, the process was repeated until consensus was attained to include or exclude a recommendation.

Phase 1. The aim of Phase 1 was to identify the contributions of clinical and laboratory variables that in practice were the most predictive of the decision to initiate DMARD therapy in a population of patients with early undifferentiated synovitis. Initiation of DMARD therapy was used as an indicator of the physician’s opinion that the patient was at risk of developing persistent and/or erosive arthritis that we would currently consider to be RA. Data on 3,115 patients from 9 early arthritis cohorts who were consid- ered not to have evidence of another possible diagnosis explaining their presentation were obtained. Between July 2007 and November 2008 an expert working group developed an analysis strategy that related an agreed- upon list of standardized clinical and laboratory vari- ables collected at baseline to the initiation of DMARD treatment within the next 12 months. MTX initiation was used as the gold standard for this purpose. The analytical process aimed to identify the independent contribution of each variable on this list and included univariate regression modeling, a subsequent principal components analysis, and a multivariate regression model that included all identified components (25). The resulting list of informative variables identified during that process and the weights based on the odds ratios are shown in Table 1. Phase 2. Phase 2 consisted of a consensus-based, decision science–informed approach, which took place between November 2008 and June 2009. The purpose of this phase was to derive a clinician-based judgment on

As formas atuais de correção da visão nestes casos são: 1) Óculos; 2) Lentes de contato; 3) Transplante de Córnea. Normalmente, os óculos não produzem visão com qualidade, sendo que a maioria dos pacientes utilizam lentes de contato. Casos avançados da doença, geralmente quando as formas de tratamento anteriores não são mais suficientes, podem necessitar de trans- plante de córnea (troca da córnea doente por uma córnea doada). Desde 1996, o Anel de Ferrara vem sendo utilizado com o objetivo de aplanar e regularizar a córnea, na tentativa de melhorar a qualidade visual. Já é considerado procedimento aprovado pelo CFM (Conselho Federal de Me- dicina). Neste procedimento, a anestesia é tópica (com colírio). Após, é realizado um pequeno corte na córnea, em torno de 1mm, por onde são implantados os anéis intracorneanos (1 ou 2). Os anéis são feitos de acrílico (polimetilmetacrilato) e são introduzidos no interior da córnea. É uma técnica reversível (os anéis podem ser removidos se produzirem algum efeito indesejado). Na grande maioria dos casos, o procedimento cirúrgico é realizado em um período de 15 (quin- ze) a 30 (trinta) minutos. A recuperação visual é gradual, ocorrendo de maneira mais significativa na primeira semana, mas pode levar até meses de estabilização. O procedimento a laser em geral, é mais rápido e os túneis para implante do anel são confeccio- nados de maneira mais precisa. A prescrição dos óculos, ou lentes de contato pode ser necessária para melhorar a visão após o procedimento cirúrgico. 3. Benefícios do procedimento proposto: Com a realização do procedimento cirúrgico de implante do anel intracorneano pode ocorrer diminuição do grau de astigmatismo e melhora da visão. O resultado não é garantido. O paciente pode necessitar de um transplante de córnea se o implante do anel intracorneano não trouxe os benefícios esperados. Estes procedimentos ci- rúrgicos não melhoram os danos causados à visão por problemas da retina, glaucoma ou outras doenças oculares.

Many complicated and expensive techniques have been applied extensively in literature to extract relationships and dependencies from data. These techniques generally rely on a deep parse results that gives a rich representation which is used for applications in knowledge extraction and semantics. The problem with biomedical data parsing is that there is no exhaustive tagged training corpus available to build models for efficient parsing on test data. Also, deep parsing is computationally very expensive compared to shallow parsing that uses the finite state automaton techniques. UMLS graciously provides such a shallow parser[7] that is trained on entire Medline corpus and claims to achieve over 97% accuracy.

Nevertheless, underrepresented minority students should not be discouraged from applying to osteopathic med- ical schools based on the current student population’s racial composition. These statistics are simply statistics and do not in any way reflect bias against minorities within the osteopathic medical profession. Also, while osteo- pathic medical students have historically been older than their allopathic counterparts, the average age of students matriculating into osteopathic schools seems to be getting progressively younger every year. In 2012, it was 25 years old, not much older than the average age of MD school matriculants in the same year, which was 24.22, 23 If becoming a physician is your goal, the statistics and information provided above should be enough to show that there are indeed two similar, legitimate paths you can take to become trained as a physician in the United States. As we have also pointed out, however, there are several fundamental differences between allopathic and osteo- pathic education and practice. In the next chapter, we will discuss the history and origin of osteopathic philosophy in order to explain how this profession’s foundation was laid over a century ago.

Even with sufficient clinical trial evidence at the time of regulatory approval, it is important to recognize that the benefits may not be realized in clinical practice because of a range of reasons, such as bias in measuring outcomes in clinical trials or underreporting of adverse events (78).

In this method, we first build a SVM to separate positive relationships from negative, neutral and no-relationship. We then build a SVM to separate negative from neutral and no- relationship. Finally we separate neutral from no-relationship. Such an ordering is chosen on the basis of both manual observations and empirical evaluation.

A RA was first divided in number of article sections (futher reffered to as RAS) and elements (RAE). Participants agreed that the main article sections that are inevitable in any modern journal are, in this order: Title, Authors, Abstract, Introduction (I), Methodology (M), Results (R), Conclusions and Discussion (D) and References. These are the core body of RA. Additional listed RAS's were: Author-paper documentation, Keywords, Acknowledgements, Abbreviations and Appendices. The RAEs listed were: tables, figures (graphs, maps, diagrams, sketches etc.), equations, citations and footnotes and comments. The RAEs can come in different places in the RA, however tables and figures are more usual in Results section and equations and citations in Methodology and Introduction. All these RAS's and RAEs have their function and required style and should form a coherent unity. The functions of main RAS's and discussed rules of thumb are given in Table 2. Give summary results

of care data [ 12 ] . The NCI estimate for expenditure on prostate cancer treatment in 2006 was $9.862 billion, and average Medicare payments per patient in the fi rst year after diagnosis were $11 000. It should be noted when interpreting this data that use of PSA testing for prostate cancer is more widespread in the USA than in many other countries, thus increasing the number of cases identifi ed. In addition, Medicare did not cover certain cancer care expenses such as oral medicines, commonly used to treat prostate cancer until January 2006. These out-of-pocket costs may comprise 10% of the $11 000 estimate. Direct medical expenditures are only one part of the total economic burden of cancer, as cancer- related illnesses and death lead to losses in economic productivity.

Pvivaxhas been widely identified in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and sporadic cases in other Asian countries. Many countries with both urban and rural malaria transmission may not have malaria risk in the most frequently visited major cities. †Equal efficacy; choice depends on traveller, itinerary, side-effects, individual choices, and convenience. ‡Tafenoquine and atovaquone can act also on the liver stage; doxycycline, azithromycin, and proguanil have limited activity in the liver stage. §Not recommended for travelling to Thailand borders with Cambodia and Burma due to mefloquine resistance. ||Need to check G6PD level before prescribing. Sometimes used as terminal prophylaxis in travellers with prolonged stays in countries with P vivaxor P ovale to eliminate the hypnozoite stage in the liver. ¶Primaquine has an effect on the liver-stage (primary schizont) of all four plasmodium species, and the sexual blood stages of all four species but only the asexual blood stages of P vivaxbut not Pfalciparum.

As depicted by the line graph in each of the charts below, total healthcare spending on a per patient basis spikes in the month of diagnosis (month 0) for lung and colorectal cancer or the month following diagnosis (month 1) for breast cancer, and then steadily declines for months until leveling off after the first year. The observed increase before diagnosis is consistent with medical services leading to diagnosis.

In this example, K 0, 1 = 1960 and K 0, 2 = 1960. > Select out-of-the-money put options with strike prices < K 0. Start with the put strike immediately lower than K 0 and move to successively lower strike prices. Exclude any put option that has a bid price equal to zero (i.e., no bid). As shown below, once two puts with consecutive strike prices are found to have zero bid prices, no puts with lower strikes are considered for inclusion. (Note that the 1350 and 1355 put options are not included despite having non-zero bid prices.)

Choosing a doctor to treat cancer is one of the most important decisions for newly diagnosed cancer patients. Typically, the doctor who made the preliminary diagnosis, usually the patient’s primary care physician, will recommend appropriate cancer specialists. There are three main types of cancer physicians or oncologists, based on the type of treatment service they provide: medical (those who treat cancer using chemotherapy and other drugs), surgical, and radiation. Some types of oncologists focus on specific populations. For example, pediatric oncologists spe- cialize in the care of children, and hematologists specialize in patients with blood disorders. Some cancers, such as skin and prostate cancer, may be treated by doctors who specialize in specific body systems (i.e., dermatologists and urologists, respectively). Plastic surgeons may also be involved in cancer treatment by performing reconstructive surgeries as part of cancer care, particularly for patients with breast or head and neck cancers.

been compared with the other possible conditions and there was no significant difference between them but graph slope between these three points. Here in the first part from 30 to 45 minutes, the possible reason could be increase abrasion time and as a result, more peaks are removed. Therefore, surface roughness in this region improves and there will be a finer surface than first. However, in the second part from 45 to 60 minutes, excess abrasion time makes fine surface scratched by continuing abrasion after removal of peaks. However, this conclusion may not be completely true or even may not be the only reason, because abrasive particles will be abraded themselves after such a long period of finishing. Here this hypothesis appears that maybe, probable abrasive particle fracture due to smash through finishing process makes them sharp again and these new sharp cutting edges even in smaller size, continue abrasion and make surface ragged. After investigating these parameters independently, it worth compare them together to get a general layout form their behavior. Figure 6 illustrates their effect on surface roughness in different conditions. Table 1 shows the order of experiments that are shown in Figure 6.

A patient’s decision to use an OON provider selection may be intentional or accidental. Reasons patients may incur OON costs include patient preference for a particular provider or specialty care center that may be out of network, the lack of network providers with appropriate specialists, and the lack of awareness or transparency about which providers are in the patient’s plan network. Common scenarios for accidental use of OON providers are emergency care or care from an OON provider working at an in-network hospital (e.g., radiologist, assistant surgeon, anesthesiologist).22 23 Figure 9 suggests that there might be significant financial consequences to the patient going out of network, which could be exacerbated if health plans remove popular cancer providers from their networks. Figure 9 also provides information on the relationship between the OON percentage (right vertical axis--relative to total spending) and total patient cost-sharing (left vertical axis). While most patients in our study reported under 10% of all OOP cost in the year of diagnosis is spent on out-of- network providers, those in the highest percentile of OOP spending incurred as much as 40% of those costs out-of-network.

As water and dissolved salts within masonry travel toward a coated exterior surface, they may be stopped at the inner margin of the coating (usually 1/ 8 to 1/ 4 in. [3 to 6 mm] below the surface). At this point, the water will evapo- rate, passing through the treated area as vapor and soluble salts in the water will be deposited within the mason- ry. Known as cryptoflorescnece or subflorescence, salts that crystallize within masonry can develop tremendous pressures which may result in brick spalling. For this reason, coatings are not recommended as the sole treatment for efflorescence problems.

Metformin is listed by the World Health Organization as an essential medicine to treat and prevent type 2 diabetes. As a biguanide, metformin is related to guanidine and galegine, which can both be extracted from goat’s rue (Galega officionalis). This medicinal plant was traditionally used in medieval Europe as a treat- ment for diabetes and other ailments, including infections such as the plague and typhoid fever. Metformin was first synthesized in 1922, but its use as an antidiabetic agent was only proposed in 1957, a discovery closely linked to malaria owing to the structural relatedness of metformin to proguanil, a highly potent antimalarial biguanide. In the 1940s, metformin was tested in patients with an ongoing malaria blood stage infection while a search was underway for alternatives to proguanil, which was becoming ineffective because of parasite resistance (34, 37). Although no clear effect on parasitemia was found (34), lowered glucose levels were later noticed after metformin treatment (37). Indeed, the antihyperglycemia property appears to be common to most biguanides, but metformin outperforms with minimal lactic acidosis. With a long track record of clinical use, metformin has proved to be highly tolerable, with a strong safety profile and few interactions with other medications. In addition, metformin is water-soluble, is orally bioavail- able, has excellent pharmacokinetic adsorption and excretion properties, and has a low cost of production, making it highly affordable and accessible (37, 38). These properties contribute to metformin’s qualifications as an optimal drug for repurposing (39). Interest in metformin repurposing has been sparked in recent years because of numerous epidemiologic observations and meta-analyses demonstrating positive outcomes and improved prognosis in diabetes patients diagnosed with cancer. To date more than 100 clinical trials in oncolo- gy are underway to determine the benefits of metformin as adjunctive therapy in treating and preventing cancer and longevity-related causes, such as inflammation, senescence, and oxidative damage (39–41). It is also being studied as a potential adjunctive therapy to treat infections such as tuberculosis (25, 42) and AIDS (43). The mechanism of action of metformin is not fully defined because it appears to have multiple pleio- tropic direct and indirect effects on various cell processes and cell targets. In the treatment of diabetes, metformin is widely used to decrease glucose production and output from the liver and increase circulating insulin sensitivity. These effects are thought to be a result of metformin’s interaction with mitochondria, where it alters cellular bioenergetics by inhibiting the respiratory chain complex I. This leads to a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation and subsequent drop in energy with altered ADP-to-ATP ratios (22, 44, 45). As a consequence, several pathways are affected, such as through the activation of the energy sensor AMPK and a shutdown in gluconeogenesis (46–48). AMPK-dependent processes that are altered include suppression of mTOR and insulin receptor signaling (IGF-I) via PI3K/AKT pathways, leading to decreased protein synthesis and cell growth and increased apoptosis and autophagy (49).

Figure 3 presents a cumulative view of total healthcare spending for cancer patients. Over the 47- month period following diagnosis, patients who we could track had average cumulative total healthcare costs of $101,000 for breast cancer, $165,000 for colorectal cancer, and $282,000 for lung cancer. The cumulative figures by month since diagnosis are represented in the left axis using solid lines. Patient OOP costs are shown as dashed lines using the right axis. Relative to total average spending of $101,000 to $282,000 for the 4 year period, the patient OOP of $7,500 to $11,000 suggests that ESI provides substantial protection to many patients. We note that patient contributions to premium would be in addition to the patient OOP costs. Premium contributions averaged approximately $1,100 per employee per year for single coverage, and over $5,000 for family coverage in 2016.20 Patients may face other costs not reflected in these data such as travel expenses and loss of income.

Here we build a SVM to separate neutral and no-relationships first from positive and negative ones. We then build two other SVMs to separate between neutral and no-relationship and between positive and negative relationships, respectively. The above combination strategy is based on analyses of our dataset, which shows that positive and negative relationships often exhibit similar characteristics when compared against the other two types.

Throat. The throat is a slot-like opening directly above the top of the firebox through which flames, smoke and combustion gases pass into the smoke chamber and upward through the chimney. Because of its effect on draft, the throat of the fireplace should be carefully designed. It should be a minimum of 8 in. (200 mm) above the highest point of the fireplace opening. The throat is illustrated in Fig. 1a and appropriate dimensions are found in Table 1.

This paper introduces an unsupervised vector ap- proach to disambiguate words in biomedical text us- ing contextual information from the UMLS. Our ap- proach makes disambiguation decisions for words that have the same ST unlike Humphrey et al. (2006). We believe that our approach shows promise and leads us to our goal of exploring the use of biomedical knowledge sources.

On your suggestion that the OECD develop new guidance on how companies work with security forces, our view is that doing so would needlessly duplicate the good work that is being done under the Voluntary Principles for Security and Human Rights, which you mention in your letter. The Voluntary Principles are a multi-stakeholder effort involving four OECD member governments and has been established to address the specific challenge your letter identifies. It would be more effective and efficient to direct additional resources to that effort than for the OECD to launch its own program in this area. In this regard, you may want to engage the governments of Canada and Australia with the suggestion that they join the Principles.

Properties of insulation materials vary widely. Table 3 shows various properties of insulation materials used in brick masonry cavity walls. The thermal conductivity (k) and thermal resistance (R) provide a means of comparing the insulating properties of insulation materials. These are determined in accordance with ASTM C 177 Test Method for Steady-State Heat Flux Measurements and Thermal Transmission Properties by Means of the Guarded-Hot-Plate Apparatus measured at various temperatures. Due to the large number of types of insulation, and even larger number of manufacturers, Table 3 lists only a few representative values of physical properties. For some materials, an aged or stabilized value is given. In all cases, the aged or stabilized value is the one that should be used in design. Individual manufacturers should be consulted for design values and other properties of their specific materials and their applications.

A: Under the order, a business cannot require workers to leave their homes unless the workers are “necessary to sustain or protect life or to conduct minimum basic operations.” Workers considered necessary to sustain or protect life are those who meet the definition of “critical infrastructure workers” provided in sections 8 and 9 of the order. Only workers properly designated for these purposes can be on- site. All other in-person business operations must be suspended. In determining whether certain in-person operations are permitted under the order, businesses that offer goods and services must bear in mind that, under the order, individuals are only allowed to leave their homes to secure necessary services or supplies, such as food, medication, and products necessary to maintain the safety, sanitation, and basic operation of their residences. Businesses must tailor their in-person provision of goods and services accordingly.

To provide quality care to the cancer survivor, oncology nurses should understand the characteristics and reasons for CAM use and examine personal views and beliefs regarding CAM. Once personal biases and beliefs have been identified, the nurse can explore reasons for looking into the use of these therapies with the patient. Nurses should approach CAM with a non-judgmental attitude (Saxe et al., 2008) to avoid non-report- ing of CAM use by the patient. Saxe et al. (2008) and Frenkel et al. (2005) reported that patients often do not report the use of CAM primarily because of the healthcare provider’s negative attitudes or limited knowledge regarding their use. Addition- ally, the patient or survivor may choose only to disclose one of multiple CAM therapies that they are using (Saxe et al., 2008). Robinson and McGrail (2004) reported that disclosure rates of CAM use ranged from 23%–90%. Chen, Bernard, and Cottrell (1999) demonstrated lower reporting to physicians who did not practice some form of CAM (67%) versus those who did (90%). Disclosure remains important to consider because patients who are seeing CAM providers and subsequently engaging in CAM treatments in addition to conventional care may cause interrup- tion in their treatment and potential harm to themselves (Saxe et al., 2008). Cultural sensitivity also is essential for understanding CAM use. Cultural beliefs are important in the acceptance of, or mistrust with, conventional health care. This can lead to subse- quent rejection of Western health care (Mao et al., 2008). Nursing assessment should focus on psychological processes of the patient (Gansler et al., 2008), including fear, quality of life, and spiritual values, as well as feelings of hope, optimism, and personal control (Richardson et al., 2000) (see Table 2). An evaluation of common characteristics may assist the pro- vider in identification of increased use. An example of this is that supplement use has been reported to be associated with survivors with increased exercise and dietary changes that in- cluded increased fruit and vegetable intake (Gunther, Patterson, Kristal, Stratton, & White, 2004; Miller et al., 2008). Preliminary assessment also should include factors such as financial concerns related to care, cancer type, stage, prognosis,

T here are two main distinctions between osteopathic and allopathic physicians. The first, more obvious difference lies in the osteopathic physicians’ use of osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM). While OMM is most commonly known by the general public to treat neuromusculoskeletal injury, DOs may utilize it in their diagnosis and treatment of disease involving internal organs and all other parts of the body as well. The other, more subtle – and arguably more important – distinction between the two professions is that osteopathic medicine offers a concise philosophy on which all clinical practice is based. Central to this philosophy is the belief that the body has an inherent healing mechanism that allows it to maintain health, resist illness, and recover from disease processes. The goal of osteopathic medical treatment is

Passive solar design can be used in conjunction with cavity wall construction to take full advantage of masonry's thermal mass properties. Solar design techniques, such as the use of building orientation, daylighting and thermal mass, can provide both comfort and energy savings for the owner and occupants. It is best to incorporate passive solar techniques in a building during the preliminary design phase. Technical Notes 43 Series has information on passive solar design techniques. Other references are available to assist in design [4, 8].

decreases the accuracy levels as shown in Table 9. The main reason is that it might just add redundant or even incorrect information for creating semantic structures due to limitations in the current co-reference identification module. Table 9 shows that the overall accuracy drops when including co-references, regardless of the feature set being used to construct the (2 vs. 2) SVM classifier .

Table 6 lists the model accuracy for polarity analysis based on various feature combinations and kernel functions. To understand this table, let us take an example of the row with feature combination (2+5) for the One vs. All method. (2+5) represents the feature combination of POS-based unigrams with WordNet correction and unary semantics-based sequential structures. The column L1 lists the best kernel function used to separate the positive polarity from the rest, which is the polynomial kernel for the feature set (2+5). The column L2 gives the best kernel function used to separate negative from (neutral and no- relationship). The same level2 kernel is used to separate neutral from no-relationship. In the case of (2+5), the RBF kernel delivers the best result. The columns +, -, = and ! list the average accuracy for each of the polarities after 10-fold cross validation using the

If parents want to test their child in the absence of symptoms, we encourage waiting until seven days after exposure. If their child has a negative result; the student will still need to quarantine 14 days from last exposure. This is because it could take up to 14 days for symptoms to appear.

Use of recommended colorectal cancer screening tests can both detect cancer early, when treatment is more effective, and pre- vent cancer, through the detection and removal of precancerous polyps. However, in 2013, only 59% of adults 50 years of age and older reported receiving colorectal cancer screening according to guidelines.81

For question (b), Table 4.3 (p.78) shows the estimated annual costs of standard treatment regimens for a select set of cancers, calculated based on the dosages recommended in clinical guidelines and the prices of cancer medicines in India, South Africa, Australia and the USA. These countries were selected to illustrate prices of medicines in countries of different economies and with different levels of price regulations. The analysis found that the estimated treatment costs frequently exceeded the per-patient annual "budgets" estimated in question (a), despite the generous assumptions of 1% to 5% of total health budget being spent

Another seemingly counter-intuitive result is that constructing unigram features from neighborhood of a relationship-depicting phrase (RDP) actually degrades the performance as against from the RDP only. The main reason being that more than 50% of the unigrams formed using the neighborhood have a term and document frequency of 1 or 2. This in turn has introduced irrelevant features to the model. Table 10 shows that the overall accuracy reduces to 0.85 from 0.88 for the Two vs. Two Method when using the entire RDP neighborhood to form unigrams.

Information Management Systems, Inc. Oncology Analyzer database, survival data, expert opinion, data from the literature, and unit costs from various published offi cial sources. Costs were infl ated to 2006 rates using consumer price indexes (France, Germany, Italy and Spain) or a health infl ation index (UK). The initial treatment costs per patient, which included the cost of biopsy and subsequent surgical or non- surgical treatment, were € 3171 in the UK, € 4057 in Germany, € 5851 in France, € 5226 in Italy and € 3256 in Spain ( Fig. 1 ). Surgery accounted for the largest proportion of initial treatment costs in most countries, with the exception of the UK, where radiotherapy accounted for a greater percentage ( Fig. 1 ). Costs of treatment over 1 year were calculated for all patients, regardless of whether they were treated, and included the unit costs of treatment, relapse costs and average monthly follow-up costs. The total costs for all diagnosed patients in the fi rst year after diagnosis were € 116.7 million (UK), € 179 million (Germany), € 167.5 million (France), € 106.7 million (Italy) and € 114.6 million (Spain). In comparison, a recent study in Italy by Lazzaro et al . [ 13 ] also looked at the fi rst-year costs of prostate cancer in 2000. The estimated cost per patient in Italy was € 6600, which is higher than the value estimated in the Fourcade publication [ 14 ] . The difference in values is probably attributable to lower rates of radiation treatment and a higher use of hormonal treatment in the Lazzaro study, in which

The undersigned hereby voluntarily consents to undergo a health screening test performed by Healthwaves. I understand that it is not possible to diagnose or define any disease or problem with a single test alone, and that a screening cannot detect every health problem. For example, a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test cannot detect all prostate cancers. I understand these tests are for screening purposes only and are not diagnostic tests or a substitute for a more complete examination by a physician. Blood test results can fluc- tuate from day to day due to changes in the individual and from laboratory variation. As a result, a test may be abnormal at one time and not another. If any of my results fall outside normal ranges, I understand I should see a physician for a follow up evaluation. Often a retest by your physician will be necessary. A new sterile needle is used for each blood test. I understand possible but infrequent side effects include fainting, bacterial infection, or bruising (hematoma) at the puncture site. In rare circumstances, I may be contacted for a redraw due to a poor lab sample. I understand that because these are screenIng tests, they are not reImbursable under most Insurance plans. Screening tests are being performed per the direction and authority of the Healthwaves Medical Director, Patrick N. Connell, M.D. or as otherwise designated on the laboratory requisition or results forms.

Propranolol has also been investigated in patients suffering from severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Two clinical studies of this beta blocker have shown possible benefits in the early-stage interventional prevention and subsequent therapy of PTSD [36,37]. Subsequent reports have also echoed that propranolol might be effective for this condition [38-40], although other reports dispute this conclusion [41,42]. When considered in aggregate these clinical studies of propranolol, as the well known prototypical beta blocker, provide convincing evidence that the drug can exert somatic (i.e., peripheral) effects on the cardiovascular system in the context of panic and anxiety disorders. With regard to affecting the psychic (CNS) symptoms, the results have been negative, inconsistent, or inconclusive. That being said, there is some limited evidence that propranolol can exert some psychic (CNS) benefits in clinical stress trials. In a pair of clinical studies, propranolol (a central and peripheral beta-blocker) significantly enhanced problem solving during stress, whereas nadolol (peripheral only beta-blocker) and lorezapam (benzodiazepine) did not [43, 44]. Thus, propranolol enhanced cognitive flexibility (“creativity”) during stress. It remains unclear whether propranolol alone can appreciably reduce psychic effects. In aggregate the clinical evidence does not support a benefit regarding psychic (CNS) anxiety symptoms.

Despite the well-delineated process for recommending drugs for coverage, Canada has the second highest drug spending in the world. Furthermore, because coverage decisions are ultimately made at the provincial level and by private insurers, the actual negotiated prices and discounts are kept confidential. Coverage for cancer drugs varies by province and insurer, both in terms of formulary decisions and out-of- pocket costs.

Sleep regulation is a complex interaction between the homeostatic and the endogenous circadian processes (Borbély et al. 2016). The circadian processes of sleep are largely controlled by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus (Dai et al. 1998; Hofman et al. 1996; Swaab et al. 1985; Vimal et al. 2009). This in- ternal human clock responds to external factors with the greatest influence being exposure to light/dark (LD) cycle (Lewy et al. 1980; Morin 2015). The other import- ant element to the timing of the sleep/wake cycle is the endogenously produced neural hormone melatonin, pro- duced by the pineal gland in response to signals from the SCN. Melatonin can induce sedation, an effect sometimes utilized to assist children in tolerating med- ical procedures (Johnson et al. 2002). In addition to regulation of the sleep/wake cycle, body temperature and numerous other processes vary with circadian rhythm (Sack et al. 2007). Externally introduced

Risk information is presented in various sections of the approved labeling. The ADVERSE REACTIONS section is the repository for all adverse reactions associated with a drug. Depending on the seriousness or other important clinical implications of an adverse reaction, it may also be discussed in greater detail in other labeling sections, in particular the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and BOXED WARNING sections.14 For example, the ADVERSE REACTIONS section of approved human drug labeling is explicitly required to “describe the overall adverse reaction profile of the drug based on the entire safety database.”15 The threshold for inclusion of an adverse event16 in approved human drug labeling is a determination that “there is some basis to believe there is a causal relationship between the drug and the occurrence of the adverse event.”17 Whether there is some basis to believe there is a causal relationship is a matter of judgment based on factors such as: (1) the frequency of reporting of the event, (2) whether the adverse event rate for a drug exceeds the placebo rate, (3) the extent of dose-response, (4) the extent to which the adverse event is consistent with the pharmacology of the drug, (5) the timing of the event relative to the time of drug exposure, (6)

Eventuais custos para coleta da amostra não estão inclusos no valor do serviço, sendo de inteira responsabilidade do paciente). Ainda, com relação à amostra, é importante que você esclareça com o seu médico (e apenas assine este documento caso obtenha todas as informações) sobre todo o cuidado requerido no manejo, armazenamento e transporte de material biológico.

Profit control is an effective measure to manage medicine prices insofar as the regulators have control over the supply of medicines at certain points along the supply chain. Typically, this means that the regulator needs to have full visibility of the supply and distribution chains. The regulator also needs to have the capacity and ability to enforce non-compliance. Profit control is most effective when there is a publicly- funded universal programme for the provision of medicines. In contrast, it may be much less effective in health care settings where the private sector plays a significant role in the delivery of medicines, or where the structure of supply chain is complex or under-developed (183).

Generally, ΔKi is half the difference between the strike prices on either side of K i. For example, the ΔK for the next-term 1325 Put is 37.5: ΔK 1325 Put = (1350 – 1275)/2. At the upper and lower edges of any given strip of options, ΔK i is simply the difference between K i and the adjacent strike price. In this example, the 1370 Put is the lowest strike in the strip of near- term options and 1375 is the adjacent strike. Therefore, ΔK 1370 Put = 5 (i.e., 1375 – 1370).

time to fall asleep (sleep latency), number of awakenings, wake time after sleep onset (WASO), sleep duration, and napping can be quantified retrospectively during the clinical assessment and prospectively with sleep-wake logs. Although no specific quan- titative sleep parameters define insomnia disorder, common complaints for insomnia patients are an average sleep latency >30 minutes, wake after sleep onset >30 minutes, sleep effi- ciency <85%, and/or total sleep time <6.5 hours.19,20 Day-to-day variability should be considered, as well as variability during longer periodicities such as those that may occur with the men- strual cycle or seasons. Patterns of sleep at unusual times may assist in identifying Circadian Rhythm Disorders such as Ad- vanced Sleep Phase Type or Delayed Sleep Phase Type. Assess- ing whether the final awakening occurs spontaneously or with an alarm adds insight into the patient’s sleep needs and natural sleep and wake rhythm. Finally, the clinician must ascertain whether the individual’s sleep and daytime complaints occur despite adequate time available for sleep, in order to distinguish insomnia from behaviorally induced insufficient sleep. IV. Nocturnal Symptoms: Patient and bed partner reports may also help to identify nocturnal signs, symptoms and behav- iors associated with breathing-related sleep disorders (snoring, gasping, coughing), sleep related movement disorders (kick- ing, restlessness), parasomnias (behaviors or vocalization), and comorbid medical/neurological disorders (reflux, palpitations, seizures, headaches). Other physical sensations and emotions associated with wakefulness (such as pain, restlessness, anxi- ety, frustration, sadness) may contribute to insomnia and should also be evaluated. V. Daytime Activities and Daytime Function: Daytime activities and behaviors may provide clues to potential causes and consequences of insomnia. Napping (frequency/day, times, voluntary/involuntary), work (work times, work type such as driving or with dangerous consequences, disabled, caretaker responsibilities), lifestyle (sedentary/active, home- bound, light exposure, exercise), travel (especially across time zones), daytime dysfunction (quality of life, mood, cog- nitive dysfunction), and exacerbation of comorbid disorders should be evaluated in depth. Common daytime consequences include:

on cancer medicines (alone). For example, the treatment cost for one patient with chronic myeloid leukaemia for a year would be between US$ 800 and US$ 96 700 for imatinib and US$ 800 to US$ 109 400 for dasatinib, which are higher than the per-person budget of US$ 800 to US$ 40 600 estimated in Table 4.2. The unaffordability was even more prominent when considering the standard treatment regimen for early stage HER2- positive breast cancer, where the estimated costs ranged between US$ 18 500 and US$ 71 000. These examples suggest that, at current prices, universal coverage of cancer medicines (alone) will greatly exceed 5% of total expenditure on health care. This is unaffordable and unsustainable.

It is usually not advisable to wash efflores- cence off of the brickwork except in warm, dry weather, since this results in the availability of considerably more moisture which may bring more salts to the surface. Many efflorescing salts can be removed by dry brushing. For recommendations concerning removing efflorescence and other stains on masonry walls, see Technical Note 20. Special care should be exercised in cleaning new masonry, since improper procedures and errors can contribute to or cause efflorescence or stains.

Unrestrained thermal movement is the product of temperature change multiplied by the coefficient of thermal expansion and the length of the element. The stresses developed by restrained thermal move- ments are equal to the change in temperature multi- plied by the coefficient of thermal expansion and by the modulus of elasticity of the material.

This paper summarizes the key research findings on the frequency, human cost, and financial impact of these diagnostic errors, while providing new data on the value of second opinions. An extensive Institute of Medicine (IOM) report underscores the importance of this with its conclusion that most Americans will receive an inaccurate or late diagnosis at least once in their lives, often with life-threatening consequences.

As reflected in the statutory new drug and new animal drug approval standards in sections 505 109 and 512 of the FD&C Act and the standard for licensure under section 351 of the PHS Act, the 110 evidence that is the basis for the risk assessment of a drug differs from the evidence that is the 111 basis for an effectiveness determination. The effectiveness determination is generally intended 112 to evaluate a drug’s positive effect based on adequate and well-controlled trials designed to 113 evaluate a specific efficacy variable (or a discrete number of efficacy variables) for the purpose 114 of distinguishing the effect of the drug from other influences.11 In contrast, FDA’s premarket 115 risk assessment is intended to identify and characterize the nature, frequency, and severity of the 116 usually broad spectrum of adverse events and other risks associated with the use of a product 117 based on a range of data sources. For human drugs, the supporting data are generally not derived 118 from studies designed to test a specific safety hypothesis. The assessment is based largely on 119 observations of adverse events from studies intended to assess effectiveness and includes all 120 patients exposed to the investigational drug during its development. For animal drugs, there are 121 generally data from safety studies in the target animal, in addition to observations of adverse 122 events from studies intended to assess effectiveness.12 For both human and animal drugs, 123 relevant data are weighted and integrated, based on the nature and reliability of the data sources, 124 into a coherent assessment of what adverse reactions are reasonably associated with the use of a 125 product and, to the extent possible, their frequency and severity.13 126

In the last few years there has been more research devoted to CAM. However, there still remain many obstacles for CAM to be integrated into cancer treatment, especially lung cancer. The lack of resources (plants) to produce these herbal remedies could result in inadequate supply for the potentially high demand. The technology required for plant extraction and mixture preparation is another hurdle in establishing an adequate supply. Another obstacle is the lack of
nursing and palliative care. If these components were to be factored in, the true total costs are likely to exceed £ 55 million ( Table 1 ) [ 9,16 ] . When total national direct costs of the fi rst year after diagnosis were calculated to include initial non- hormonal therapies, the cost of a 6-month maximum follow-up treatment and hormonal therapy, as well as the costs for patients who relapse within a year, the incidence total cost for the UK was estimated at £ 97 million in 2007, ≈ 0.12% of the UK ’ s annual spending on the NHS of that year [ 14,19 ] .

We feel that the Journal of Forecasting policies are ambitious. We propose these policies as a way to obtain better papers and to help authors to increase the likelihood of publication. However, violations of these guidelines will not eliminate a paper as a candidate for publication. We would not be so bold as to suggest these policies define the best procedures for all authors, associate editors, or referees. The policies should be an aid, not a restriction.

such as article type, discipline, and funding source, (9), for example, none were able to control for abstract qualities such as relevance, novelty, and importance to a field of study, variables that are unobservable to the researcher. In addition, an author’s willingness and ability to pay open access publishing fees, some amounting to several thousands of dollars, may make simple performance comparisons with subscription- access articles highly problematic (12). By randomly altering access status in an experimental trial, we are able to isolate and measure the effects of access on readership and citations independently of other con- founding variables.

It is significant that it was fairly straightforward to port various methods developed for ad hoc MED- LINE citation retrieval, indexing and classification to the assignment of codes to clinical text. The modifications to MTI consisted of replacing Re- strict to MeSH with Restrict to ICD-9-CM, training the Related Citations method on clinical text and replacing MTI’s normal post-processing with a much simpler version.

Mental health problems and depression Sport and exercise are protective against depression.100 Most studies examining the relationship of contact sports to mental health problems or depression later in life have low methodolog- ical quality, high risk of bias or both.101–103 Several studies have reported that NFL and college football athletes with a history of concussion are more likely to experience depression, although the risk of mental health issues, including suicide, among former NFL players is lower than age-matched controls.101–103 Former high school football players show no difference in cognitive func- tion testing and have lower depression scores when compared with non-contact sport controls.104 Mental health issues are common, multifactorial and often present independent of partic- ipation in contact or collision sport. Longitudinal research on contact sport athletes that addresses multiple variables is needed to understand the long-term risks. (C)

• Fatigue and sleepiness. Feelings of fatigue (low energy, physical tiredness, weariness) are more common than symptoms of sleepiness (actual tendency to fall asleep) in patients with chronic insomnia. The presence of significant sleepiness should prompt a search for other potential sleep disorders. The number, duration, and timing of naps should be thoroughly investigated, as both a consequence of in- somnia and a potential contributing factor.

The estimated risk for a traveller acquiring malaria differs markedly from area to area.2,36,37,45,46 This variability is a function of the intensity of transmission within the various regions, the season of travel, and of the itinerary and type of travel.36,37 Ongoing malaria transmission occurs in large areas of Central and South America, Hispaniola, Africa, the Indian subcontinent, southeast Asia, the middle east, eastern Europe, and the south Pacific islands.1,2,5,10,35,36,43,44 There has been a marked increased in tourism, immigration, and refugee, student, and business travel to these malaria-endemic areas.25,30,47 International migration has risen from 120 million in 1990 to 175 million in 2002.28 Non- immune individuals are particularly susceptible to develop severe malaria if exposed to an infected mosquito, particularly in areas with high levels of transmission.2,5,14,19,36,45,46 Some groups are at higher risk. Immigrants to developed countries who are returning to homes and families in endemic countries (visiting friends and relatives) are at much higher risk of acquiring malaria.24,30–33 Indeed, this particular group of travellers is responsible for a high volume of international travellers and experience excessive rates of travel-related morbidity including malaria and its

somnolence as a side effect is reproducible in susceptible individuals (White and Rumbold 1988). Sedation is a com- mon side effect of the traditional antipsychotics, with chlorpromazine and thioridazine somewhat more sedating than haloperidol. Clinical studies have shown a high inci- dence of persistent sedation with clozapine (46%) with less frequent reports of sedation with risperidone, olanzapine, sertindole and quetiapine (Monti et al. 2016). The sed- ation associated with these agents is most likely associated with their known effects on histaminic receptors. Doxepin, a sedating psychotropic agent with pro- nounced histamine (H-1) receptor antagonism exerts at least part of its effects by antagonizing orexin (Krystal et al. 2013). Suvorexant, is an orexin antagonist designed to lower waking arousal (Norman and Anderson 2016). Currently, it is being heavily marketed as a hypnotic (Rhyne and Anderson 2015). As based on performance and driving tests, this agent is known to produce a dose-related next day increase in somnolence for all age groupings tested (Farkus 2013). Sedative drug effects on daytime sleepiness are summarized in Table 4.

Effective immediately, hospitals shall notify an EMS provider if a patient transported to the hospital by that provider’s EMS crew subsequently tests positive for the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus. Notification must occur within 48 hours of the positive test result. This is a change from the previous 12-hour notification requirement. Notification of a positive test result is required regardless of whether CDC’s recommended use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during transport of any individual with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 was observed. Notification shall not include the name of the patient who tested positive.

If your child develops any of these symptoms, please notify his/her school and contact your child’s doctor for evaluation and testing for COVID-19 infection. Parents often have questions about testing their child after an exposure. Testing is recommended if symptoms are present, but not recommended without symptoms. A negative test does not release a student from quarantine or allow a return to in-person instruction.

1. Decide when to clean. Mortar must harden prior to cleaning. It is generally best to schedule cleaning at least seven days after brickwork is completed. In some cases it may be possible to clean earlier; how- ever, effects on the masonry and influencing factors such as weather conditions and the type of brick and mortar should be carefully considered. Prolonged time periods between the completion of the masonry and cleaning should be avoided. After one month, mortar smears and splatters left on brickwork become increasingly difficult to remove. 2. Remove larger clumps of mortar using wooden paddles or nonmetallic tools. Metal tools may damage the brickwork or leave behind fragments that oxidize and cause rust stains. 3. Select the proper cleaning solution. There are many types of proprietary cleaners available that are for- mulated to remove specific stains or for use with a particular type of brick. Be careful to select cleaning products suitable for the brick, mortar and adjacent materials and follow the cleaner manufacturer’s rec- ommended instructions. Each product being considered should be evaluated as discussed previously in Trial Cleaning.

Racking. Chimneys are generally not as wide as the body of the fireplace below. When racking back to achieve the desired dimensions or location of the chimney care must be exercised to insure that, since there is no limitation on the distance each unit may be racked, cores of the units are not exposed. Preferred construction consists of a setting bed over the racked face with uncored or paving brick set to provide a weather resistant surface. Mortar washes may also be used. They may not, however, be as durable. When using a mortar wash it should not bridge over the rack, but should fill each step individually. Both methods of racking are shown in Fig. 6.

movements and diminished skeletal EMG activity. Medi- cations producing CNS-related behavioral effects generally affect background EEG frequencies (Mamdema and Dan- hof 1992). In most cases, a consistent pattern of EEG change produced by a drug is associated with a consistent pattern of behavioral change (Hermann and Schaerer 1986). Psychoactive drugs produce alterations in physio- logic EEG rhythms consistent across therapeutic classifica- tions and utilized to predict the behavioral activity of new preparations, drug interactions and toxicities (Blume 2006) (Table 2).

under mefloquine or metformin single-drug treatments (P = 0.013 and P = 0.041; Figure 3C). Of note, mice under single or combined metformin treatments showed an extended survival, whereas 84% of the nontreat- ed mice succumbed within 1 week after infection (Table 1). In conclusion, metformin treatment in combi- nation with suboptimal dosage of conventional antimalarials is more efficacious in reducing parasite load.

Pattern Matching. We developed a pattern- matching classifier as a baseline for our more so- phisticated classification methods. A list of all UMLS string representations for each of 45 codes (including synonyms from source vocabularies other than ICD-9-CM) was created as described in the MTI section above. The strings were then con- verted to lower case, punctuation was removed, and strings containing terms unlikely to be found in a clinical report were pruned. For example, Ab- domen NOS pain and Abdominal pain (finding) were reduced to abdominal pain. For the same rea- sons, some of the strings were relaxed into pat- terns. For example, it is unlikely to see PAIN CHEST in a chart, but very likely to find pain in chest. The string, therefore, was relaxed to the fol- lowing pattern: pain.*chest. The text of the clinical history and the impression fields of the radiology reports with negated expressions removed (see Section 2.2) was broken up into sentences. Each sentence was then searched for all available pat- terns. A corresponding code was assigned to the document for each matched pattern. This pattern matching achieved F-score = 0.79 on the training set. To reduce the number of codes assigned to a document, a check for allowed combinations was added as a post-processing step. The combination of assigned codes was looked up in the table of allowed codes. If not present, the codes were re- duced to the combination of assigned codes most frequently occurring in the training set. This brought the F-score up to 0.84 on the training data. As the performance of this classifier was compara- ble to other methods, we decided to include these results when combining the predictions of the other classifiers.

Table 1 shows the results obtained for the training set. The best stacking results were obtained using predictions of all four base classifiers on the text with deleted negated expressions and with check- ing for allowed combinations. We retained all final predictions with probability of being a valid code greater than 0.3. Checking for the allowed combi- nations for the ensemble classifiers degraded the F- score significantly.

Perhaps one of the most valuable features of the VIX Index is the existence of more than 25 years of historical prices. This extensive data set provides investors with a useful perspective of how option prices have behaved in response to a variety of market conditions. Price history for the original Cboe Volatility Index (VXO) based on OEX options is available from 1986 to the present. Cboe has created a similar historical record for the new VIX Index dating back to 1990 so that investors can compare the new VIX Index with VXO, which reflects information about the volatility “skew” or “smile.”

In cavity wall construction, the prescribed air space acts as an insulating layer in addition to the masonry units. Thermal performance of the system can be further enhanced by placing insulation materials in the cavity. Insulation materials used in brick masonry cavity walls include inorganic cellular materials such as perlite and vermiculite, and organic cellular materials such as polystyrene, polyurethane, polyisocyanurate and foams. These insulation types are manufactured in the form of rigid boards, granular fills and foams. Each of these types, if properly used, will result in a more thermally efficient wall system. Although the most important characteristic for insulation is its thermal resistance, other properties should be considered including water absorption, combustibility, density, insect resistance and ease of installation. The following criteria can be used for the selection of insulation materials for brick masonry cavity walls:

the top 10. We also extract and treat as binary features four different types of subjects from Altmetric and CrossRef: Medline subject codes for journal (Altmetric), subjects as indexed by SCOPUS (Altmetric), publisher subjects (Altmetric), and CrossRef subjects. Subjects are mostly at the granularity of the journal or higher. Similar journals have subjects in com- mon, with, for instance, the journals Nature Conservation, Conservation Biology, Ecology and Evolution, and many more sharing the CrossRef subject “nature and landscape conservation.”Multidisciplinaryjournals,suchasPNASand Nature, are often tagged with more general subjects such as “science” or “multidisciplinary.” Table 2 displays the top 10 CrossRef subjects describing at least 100 articles by aver- age news coverage. As expected, health related subjects top the list, along with those related to the environment. Unfor- tunately, but as expected, “general computer science” and “computational mathematics” secured the last places, at 0.5 and 0.3 news articles on average, respectively. We also extract textual features, when available, for each document: Title, Abstract, Press Release. For scientific ar- ticles with more than one press release, we randomly select one. For each type of text document, we preprocess using a standard English stop word list, extracting counts of un- igrams and bigrams, keeping tokens which appear in more than one document and no more than 80% of documents of the same type in the training set. We keep the 30,000 most frequently occurring features in the training set. We then scale the vectors of counts by tfidf weights fit on the training set. Finally, we create a boolean feature hasPR indicating whether the scientific article received coverage on one of the two prominent press release aggregation websites, Eu- rekAlert! or Science Daily. We hypothesize that mention on one of these would expose the scientific article to more jour- nalists and thus garner more coverage.

Long-term survivors of colorectal cancer report a good overall quality of life compared with that of the general population, but higher rates of depression.83 In addition, some difficulty with chronic diarrhea occurs in about one-half of colorectal cancer survivors.84 Bowel dysfunction (including increased stool fre- quency, incontinence, and perianal irritation) is common among rectal cancer survivors, especially those treated with pelvic radiation.85, 86 In addition, survivors may suffer from bladder dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, and negative body image.40, 87 Many of these issues are more common in rectal cancer survi- vors, particularly those with a colostomy.88 A trained ostomy therapist may be able to address several of these concerns, as well as issues that arise from colostomy care, such as skin irrita- tion and dietary considerations.89
istic option. Clinical diagnosis offers the advantages of ease, speed, and low cost. In areas where malaria is prevalent, clinical diagnosis usually results in all patients with fever and no apparent other cause being treated for malaria. This approach can iden- tify most patients who truly need antimalarial treat- ment, but it is also likely to misclassify many who do not (15). Over-diagnosis can be considerable and contributes to misuse of antimalarial drugs. Considerable overlap exists between the signs and

Protocol (IP) addresses] were gathered monthly for the first year from the journal websites. Known robot activity (software robots downloading all free material for indexing purposes, e.g., Google) was removed from the data set before analysis to arrive at a more accurate estimate of human activity. Citation figures were gathered monthly from the Web of Science (http://www.isiknowledge.com) for the first 3 yr after article publication. While journals control the primary access route to articles, it is common in some disciplines and at some institutions for authors to self-archive some version of their articles on public websites or in digital repositories. To obtain an estimate of the extent and effects of self-archiving, we wrote a Perl script to search for PDF copies of articles anywhere on the Internet (ignoring the publisher’s website) 1 yr after publication. We attempted to identify as many instances of self-archiving as possible, while minimizing the number of false positives.

Participants also discovered that all RAS's can be separated in subsections or signposts, which can be arbitrary, but improve the structure of a RA. The recognized subsections were: research topic and definitions, research objectives (questions), methodological techniques, experimental set-up, object of the study (e.g. study area), main discoveries (analysed data), answers on research questions, explanation of the conclusions and further research and implications. The main RAS's are listed in a flow chart, showing main relations between different sections (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 shows the substructure of Introduction and Discussion RAS as the most important RAS's.

With some variation over time and across cancer types, care for the cancer population involves the six categories of services analyzed. The bars in Figures 2a-2c indicate that some patients had significant use of facility services in the year preceding the cancer diagnosis. For both colorectal and lung cancers, total spending on hospital inpatient increased as a percentage of total immediately following diagnosis. In all three cancers, the chemotherapy share of total spending increased rapidly in the first few months after diagnosis and, with the exception of breast cancer, continued at a fairly consistent level of around 20% of spending in subsequent years. Radiation therapy represented a small share of total spending except for breast cancer patients in the year following diagnosis.

O ceratocone, a degeneração marginal pelúcida e ectasia pós-cirurgia refrativa são doenças que causam afilamento e abaulamento da córnea (estrutura transparente que forma a parede anterior do globo ocular). Estas alterações provocam astigmatismo irregular com distorção visual importante. O grau de embaçamento visual vai depender do grau de astigmatismo produzido e da existência de outras alterações oculares associadas. Astigmatismo pós-transplante de córnea é um grau residual que ocorre dependendo da intera- ção entre córnea doada e receptor (coaptação, cicatrização, abertura e frouxidão de pontos no decorrer da cicatrização e sua retirada).

Open access articles were cited no more frequently than subscription-access articles. The estimate of cita- tion effect at 3 yr was (cid:3)1%, statistically indistinguish- able from 0 (ME 1.01; 95% CI, 0.95–1.08; P(cid:1)0.669; Table 2). Earlier citation estimates revealed similarly small, nonsignificant results (3% at 12 mo, 4% at 18 mo, 2% at 24 mo, and 2% at 30 mo). Figure 1 provides a visual comparison of results by subject category. In comparison, review articles, the number of au- thors, and page length were all significant predictors of article citations (Table 1). Articles that were self-ar- chived showed a positive effect on citations ((cid:3)11%), although this estimate was not significant (ME 1.11; 95% CI, 0.92–1.33; P (cid:1) 0.266). Just 65 articles (2%) in our data set were self-archived, however, limiting the statistical power of our test.

Costs of coronary bypass surgery is cited by more U.S. individuals and companies providing employee health insurance as being the single most important factor of consideration for seeking coronary bypass surgery abroad. Table 1 illustrates the cost comparison of coronary bypass surgery in the U.S. with India, Thailand, and Singapore; these cost comparison figures are promoted throughout the medical tourism industry. A comparison study of costs for coronary bypass surgery in two large hospitals in India, one in Thailand, and the overall California Insurer average cost payment, demonstrates the costs in India and Thailand did not exceed $15,000 while the California Insurer average (private insurance) exceeded $50,000 (Milstein and Smith 2007)

tional medications, diluent, and vehicle solutions), route of administration, and schedule are correct. At checkpoint 7, healthcare providers should exam- ine the medication container and note whether the content’s general appearance is what was expected. Many parenteral chemotherapy products have distinctive colors, and prod- uct coloration should be confirmed before administration. At checkpoint 8, patients who self-administer their medications (or receive it from personal caregivers) should carefully read the container’s label to confirm the product’s identity and review its instructions for use (schedule of dos- ing, whether to take with or without food) each time they take a medication. At checkpoint 9, patients should be encouraged to ask questions about their treatment before its administration and compare its appearance and medication label with informa- tion they received about the treatment. Patient identification using two identifiers should occur prior to chemotherapy administration. Whenever possible, barcode-driven admin- istration should be used.40 In ambulatory care practice, it is common for patients

Misdiagnosis too frequently results in serious harm to patients. In a survey of physicians, 64% said that up to 10% of the misdiagnoses they have experienced directly resulted in harm to the patient6. Another study found that 28% of 538 reported diagnostic errors were life-threatening or resulted in the patient’s death or permanent disability.7

At ranks 35 and 70, as in the daily prediction task, the models using all features perform the best, but not statisti- cally significantly better than models trained on some fea- ture subsets. At rank 7, the model trained on textual features outperforms the model with all features, but not statistically significantly. Table5givesthetopfeaturesforthemodeltrainedtoopti- mize NDCG@7 and using textual features. Again, medical and people-related terms, such as “diet,” “participants,” and “health” are quite important and of positive polarity. Inter- estingly, “protein” in the press release is of positive polar- ity on average, whereas it is negative when present in the abstract. We hypothesize that this may be because, on aver- age, very technical scientific papers, such as those mention- ing proteins and cells, are less accessible to journalists, but those which garner a press release are much more likely to be read and covered. Similar to Zhang et al. (2016) “95” (for 95% CI) is an important, positive feature, perhaps since this is commonly found in results of medical studies that may be of interest to the general public.

A further example is the pricing of sofosbuvir (Sovaldi) – a medicine used for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection, potentially preventing future cases of liver cancer. Fig. 3.3 (p.23) shows the timeline of price planning for Sovaldi based on information presented in the report by the Committee on Finance of the United States Senate (100). In this case, it shows the evolution of the expected price of Sovaldi from prior to its acquisition (<US$ 50 000 per course) to the final launch price of US$ 84 000 per course. The final price was decided based on an anticipated rise in revenue even though the manufacturer expected the number of patients receiving the medicine would decline (p.43) (100), and various stakeholders would react negatively to the firm’s final pricing of the product. Furthermore, the manufacturer set a high price for Sovaldi with a view to consolidate the market’s price expectation in preparation for setting an even higher price for a combination product that contains sofosbuvir (Harvoni) that would be launched after Sovaldi. It also included an arbitrary price increase from US$ 27 000 per bottle to US$ 28 000 per bottle (i.e. 3.7% increase) because it would “be easy from the press release, from 28 days and $28,000” (p.57) (100). This example demonstrates that pricing solely according to commercial goals will impair a health system’s ability to achieve public health goals because high prices limit patient access, thereby limiting the full value potential of the innovation.

Numerous alternative beta blockers are available in lieu of propranolol. Notable among these is the common drug, atenolol, that is available in oral solid dose forms ranging from 25 to 100 mg for the treatment of hypertension. Multiple doses per day may be permitted. It has been used to suppress stage fright in performers when administered orally in advance [45]. Atenolol is a beta-1 selective peripheral-acting agent without CNS effects, which should reduce the risk for asthmatic subjects [46]. Thus, atenolol might be preferred over the nonselective beta blockers for patients affected by asthma or COPD [47]. Oral atenolol at 50 - 200 mg doses suppressed heart rate by ~ 23 - 24 beats per minute (bpm) vs. ~ 10 bpm on placebo [46]. Also,

An alternative beta blocker is pindolol, a non-selective agent, which can enhance the effects of co-administered antidepressants and has some 5-HT antagonist property. Pindolol reduced symptoms of performance anxiety in musicians [51]. Another example is betaxolol that can also cross the blood- brain barrier. Daily oral betaxalol was delivered at 5 - 40 mg per day in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and other anxiety-related conditions. Anxiety and panic attacks were reduced within several days [52]. This anxiolytic benefit is prophylactic, as the effects are observed in days, rather than in minutes.

To note, interpretation of these features, especially single features, is highly conjectural. Regardless, we provide some discussion and speculation. As expected, coverage on Eu- rekAlert! or Science Daily is very predictive, as are gener- ally popular and unpopular subjects such as medicine (pop- ular) and chemistry (unpopular).

prices of pharmaceuticals grew faster than the collective prices of all goods and services (Fig. 4.6a, p.61). However, the trends in the two countries began to diverge in the late 1980s where the price level of medicines continued to rise faster in the USA, while the growth rate of pharmaceutical prices in Australia seemed to have been stabilized at around 10% higher than the consumer price index. This could possibly be due to the introduction of “cost effectiveness” as a requirement before listing a medicine on the national pharmaceutical insurance scheme, so as to ensure the benefits of a given medicine were high enough to justify the price requested by the manufacturer (246). The divergence became more prominent when the Australian Government undertook further reforms of its national scheme after 2005 (247), which was implemented in response to a report that warned “in 40 years’ time, the PBS could account for 3.4% of GDP, making it the largest part of the Government’s spending on health” (248). The reforms seem to have resulted in gradual normalization of the growth rate of medicine prices in Australia to a level in line with the overall inflation rate of other consumer goods (Fig. 4.6a). In contrast, medicine prices continued to grow considerably in the USA, with the cumulative growth reaching 2.4 times the overall inflation rate of other consumer goods in 2017. Of note, the price level of prescription medicines in the USA rose in parallel with Pricing and reimbursement policies in Australia over four decades have controlled the growth rate of medicine prices.

of the weakest links in the system. A study in Malawi revealed that the condition of many seriously ill children arriving at clinicshadnotpreviouslybeenrecognized.Insteadofreceiving immediate emergency care they were kept waiting for long periods before being given proper treatment. This resulted in avoidable deaths and disability (28). In Mexico, verbal autopsies of 132 children who died revealed that the majority had been seen by a physician within three days of death. Poor selection of medications and late referral to tertiary care were judged to be important contributory factors in more than half the deaths (29). A qualitative study of 21 hospitals in seven developing countries found that poor triage of incoming patients and inadequate provision of emergency care jeopar- dized the lives of arriving patients (30). Fourteen of the facilities (including 10 of 13 district hospitals) did not have an adequate triage system. A comprehensive review of the management of 131 children treated at these facilities found evidenceofinappropriateordelayedtriagein8%ofcases,poor clinical assessments in 41%, and potentially harmful delays in treatment in 19%. Several international health projects aimed at improving initial triage and treatment have been instituted at district health care facilities. Most focus on the strengthening of maternal and child health. One such project produced guidelines for emergency triage and treatment (28). An evaluation of these guidelines demonstrated that they significantly decreased the time required to assess children in need of urgent medical attention (31). In Sierra Leone a health care facility was upgraded in order to enhance its ability to provide prompt medical and surgicaltreatmenttowomenwithcomplicationsofpregnancy. The annual number of obstetric procedures rose from 2 to 38 over a period of five years. During the same period the

The VIX Index is a volatility index comprised of options rather than stocks, with the price of each option reflecting the market’s expectation of future volatility. Like conventional indexes, the VIX Index calculation employs rules for selecting component options and a formula to calculate index values. Some different rules and procedures apply when calculating the VIX Index value to be used for the final settlement value of VIX futures and options. For more information about those differences, refer to the section below titled “The Calculation of the Final Settlement Value for VIX Derivatives.”

For newer targeted cancer medicines, there are two additional areas of uncertainty. Firstly, despite their established mechanisms of action, targeted cancer medicines may not have clinically-meaningful activities against all tumours with a matching genetic mutation. To this point, a clinical trial has found that the progression-free survival of patients with metastatic solid tumour refractory to standard of care did not improve with the use of targeted therapies that matched with the tumour’s molecular profile but outside their approved indications, compared to patients who received treatment at the choice of their treating physicians (79). This means that targeted therapies should only be used according to approved indications and not based on identified molecular alternations or the general type of cancer.

IDENTIFICAÇÃO
In summary, public and non-profit-making sectors, and by extension tax-payers and philanthropists, have provided considerable financial and non-financial contributions towards the R&D of cancer medicines. This means that in many cases, pharmaceutical companies have not incurred the full costs of R&D. The pharmaceutical industry has also benefited greatly from the knowledge generated by public-sector investments in R&D, and by having access to research supported by public funding at costs, if any, lower than the market value.

Parents/guardians may choose a language acquisition program that best suits their child. Schools in which the parents or legal guardians of 30 pupils or more per school or the parents or legal guardians of 20 pupils or more in any grade request a language acquisition program that is designed to provide language instruction shall be required to offer such a program to the extent possible. (20 U.S.C. Section 6312[e][3][A][viii][III]); EC Section 310[a]) We are required to provide a Structured English Immersion (SEI) program option. If you choose this option, your child will be placed in a classroom that uses mostly English for instruction. Parents/guardians may provide input regarding language acquisition programs during the development of the Local Control Accountability Plan. (EC Section 52062) If interested in a different program from those listed above, please contact the English Learner Support Services Department at (951) 509-5094 to ask about the process. Parents of English learners have a right to decline or opt their children out of the school district’s language acquisition program or opt out of particular English learner service(s) within a language acquisition program. (20 U.S.C Section 6312[e][3][A][viii]) However, school districts remain obligated to provide the student meaningful instruction until the student exits the program, inform the parent when progress is not made, and offer the parent programs and services to consider at that time.

Since stacking produced the best F-score on the training corpus and is known to be more robust than the individual classifiers, the corresponding results for the test corpus were submitted to the Challenge submission website. The stacking results for the test corpus achieved an F-score of 0.85 and a secondary, cost-sensitive accuracy score of 0.83. For comparison purposes, 44 Challenge submis- sions had a mean F-score of 0.77 with a maximum of 0.89. Our F-score of 0.85 falls between the 70th and 75th percentiles.

Mathematics is a main matter of the real-life that can cover all aspects of real world. Therefore educational systems have to create new circumferences for mathematics education. The results of this study have indicated that all students of this research have understood the importance and frequency of the relation of mathematics to real-life. But students of humanities strand believed that it is not considered the relation of mathematics to real-life in teaching mathematics and also students of experimental science strand believed that it cannot create the relation between taught mathematical subjects and real-life.

To systematically assess the financial return of cancer medicines, this report undertook a study to quantify the reported global incomes from the sales of individual medicines approved by the US FDA in 1989–2017 for the treatment of haematological cancers, solid tumours and related conditions such as neutropenia and hypercalcaemia (117). Itemized product sales data were extracted from the consolidated financial reports of originator companies, supplemented and verified with publicly available sources where necessary. Sales incomes were reported net of rebates and discounts but without accounting for expenses and taxes, as per International Financial Reporting Standards.

Governments and insurers have also implemented non-price policies to ensure efficiency. For example, some countries require treating clinicians to obtain approval prior to prescribing or dispensing a select set of medicines, a practice known as prior authorization (216–218). Medicines may be selected based on criteria such as evidence-based guidelines, contractual agreements and costs. An important consideration for implementing prior authorization is to strike a balance between the level of administrative tasks to support such policies and timely patient access to treatment. For example, a process review in a breast oncology practice in the USA found that prior authorization was “complicated and labour intensive”, and had limited impact on utilization because only 2.5% of prescriptions Non-price policies could promote efficiency

Lung cancer and colorectal cancer patients had significant use of hospital inpatient services soon after diagnosis, which suggests that many patients underwent inpatient surgery in months 0 or 1. By contrast, breast cancer patients had less inpatient spending in months 0 and 1 and lower overall spending. The average monthly total healthcare spending started to drop two to three months after diagnosis. The mix of costs then became more consistently distributed across various service categories, which may reflect the varying approaches used to treat individual survivors. For example, by the time breast cancer patients reach the second month after diagnosis, the balance of services have shifted to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The pattern of spending by category shown in Figures 2a-2c illustrates an “aggregate” patient journey for these cancers—individual patients may not follow these patterns.

medicine (NMM) and OMM obtain many more hundreds of hours of manual medicine training in a wider variety of clinical settings than DCs and other DOs. This section was meant to give you a better sense of what “osteopathic manipulative medicine” entails, and hopefully it answered most of your questions regarding OMM. The effectiveness of OMM remains a topic of ongoing debate and research despite past and current efforts to lay these arguments to rest. Whether an osteo- pathic physician uses OMM in his or her practice is based entirely on preference. With that said, it is an important core discipline and primary distinction of the osteopathic profession.

The analysis found that low-income countries could spend on average up to US$ 3800 per cancer patient annually on cancer medicines for all newly-diagnosed cancer patients, and the total expenditure on these medicines would be within the generously assumed 5% of the total health expenditure (Table 4.2). In high- income countries, the analysis found that a budget threshold of 5% of the total health expenditure would allow a spending of up to US$ 40 600 on cancer medicines per patient per year, with a view to providing universal coverage.

The use of personal data is critical to ensure quality and reliability in scientific research. The new Regulation [European Union (EU)] 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data [general data protection regulation (GDPR)], repealing Directive 95/46/EC, strengthens and harmonises the rules for protecting individuals’ privacy rights and freedoms within and, under certain conditions, outside the EU territory. This new and historic legal milestone both prolongs and updates the EU acquis of the previous Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC. The GDPR fixes both general rules applying to any kind of personal data processing and specific rules applying to the processing of special categories of personal data such as health data taking place in the context of scientific research, this including clinical and translational research areas. This article aims to provide an overview of the new rules to consider where scientific projects include the processing of personal health data, genetic data or biometric data and other kinds of sensitive information whose use is strictly regulated by the GDPR in order to give the main key facts to researchers to adapt their practices and ensure compliance to the EU law to be enforced in May 2018.

The naïve interpretation of this is that no more than 13 candidate compounds would be needed for a reasonable chance of launching one new medicine, and 25 for a com- bination with two NCEs (new chemical entities). How- ever, if one aims for a 90% overall chance of success (P), the number of candidates n, each with a success probabil- ity s (8%) is described by the negative binomial distribu- tion in Eq. 1.

Data exploration has recently been hailed as the fourth paradigm in the investigation of nature, after empiricism, theory and computation (Bell, Hey & Szalay, 2009). Whether in astronomy or the life sciences, the flood of data requires sophisticated methods of handling. For example, researchers in bioinformatics collect, process and analyze masses of data, or in computational biology, they simulate biological systems, metabolic pathways, the behavior of a cell or how a protein is built (Hey, Tansley & Tolle, 2009). In clinical medicine, the end users are confronted with increased volumes of highly complex, noisy, high-dimensional, multivariate and often weakly- structured data (Holzinger, 2011c). The field of biomedical informatics concerns the information processing by both humans and computers, dealing with biomedical complexity (Patel, Kahol & Buchman, 2011) to support decision making which is still a central topic in biomedical informatics (Shortliffe, 2011).

receptor antagonist that affects the autonomic nervous system and reduces cardiovascular symptoms (e.g., tachycardia and hypertension) resulting from epinephrine in the circulation. Beta blockers interfere with receptor binding by catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine, of which epinephrine is the principal catecholamine affecting the cardiovascular symptoms. Propranolol is a lipophilic beta blocker that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, it can affect both somatic and CNS target tissues.

that likely affects anxiety/mood symptoms via the M2 and/or M1 receptors of the CNS [19]. Scopolamine was known over a century ago to produce a calming effect in psychiatric patients [20], although this property is not well known today among medical providers. There is clinical evidence that other antimuscarinic agents (e.g., promethazine), can also provide some anxiolytic benefit [6]. Beta blockers and antimuscarinic agents are included in the PanX® combinations not only for pharmacologic targeting of the sympathetic beta-1 and parasympathetic M2/M1 receptors, but also in view of historic safety. Both classes of drugs have been used in millions of patients over five decades and are known to be safe. Neither class is addictive. In addition, the high prevalence of use strongly suggests that both classes of medicines have been coincidentally and/or concurrently used in the same patient(s) as separate prescriptions and/or OTC drugs, for instance a prescription beta blocker for hypertension and a prescription or OTC antimuscarinic agent for motion sickness, nausea, or vomiting. Even with high coincident and/or concurrent use, there is no evidence in the population of producing side effects or drug-drug interactions that extend beyond those inherent within either of the monotherapies. Prior to this open label study, case series resulting from physician- sponsored studies of compounded atenolol - scopolamine provided initial evidence of effectiveness in the PRN treatment of anxiety. Three patients diagnosed with PTSD, who experienced acute anxiety episodes, were treated effectively by a psychiatrist [7-9]. In addition, three patients with acute anxiety symptoms under the care of pain management physicians were treated successfully [10]. In the present physician-sponsored open label study we document a trial of a compounded combination drug regarding anxiolytic efficacy and with no side effects in eight adult patients. The drug combo produced a fast-acting and beneficial calming effect in 6 of 8 patients, who were deemed as responders. None of the patients described any side effects, and there was no evidence of impairment of cognition.

Table 3 shows faculty participants’ self-perception of their previous experience in mentoring and as well as faculty participants’ perceptions of the workshop effectiveness. Before the workshop started, the faculty participants (n = 28) showed a medium average of previous experience in mentoring with a wide variability. Specifically, faculty participants (n = 28) yielded a mean of 3.68 (SD = 1.02) on “Do you have substantial previous experience in mentoring?” This showed some faculty do not have much previous mentoring experience while some others have substantial previous mentoring experience.

For strength analysis we build the SVRs using the entire training set without categorizing the existing records according to polarity. We also tried a variation of this approach by building individual SVRs based on polarity but found that polarity has no effect on the strength analysis.

The emergence of new forms of enterprise, discussed earlier in reference to sale of human tissues, and new forms of biotechnology, such as genetic engineering, are simply examples of this diver- gence, which arguably requires new thinking around how to radically increase transparency and accountability, as emergent technologies enable not only radically improved potential for innova- tion but also increasing connectivity between human stakeholders who are directly affected by these developments. This divergence arguably places bioethicists, and education and profession- alization of bioethics (White et al., 2014) at the forefront of strategic response to radical advances in biomedicine to come. However, given the uncertainty of ‘wicked’ problems (Rittel & Webber, 1973) related to complexity of human values negotiation over increasingly beneficial and hazard- ous potentialities, the last line of ethical resource might be the democratic population itself.

A user might be interested in certain types of relationships. It is necessary to assign types to the retrieved verbs in relationship triples. We have created patterns for the 54 UMLS Semantic Network relationship links. We assign these categories to the extracted verbs. In order to increase the accuracy of this technique, we have built a system that uses WordNet resource for finding all word sense synonyms for the verb to match against our patterns list.

Avaliação do rendimento escolar e freqüência: A avaliação do rendimento escolar do aluno será feita em cada disciplina em função de seu aproveitamento, verificando em provas e trabalhos decorrentes de aulas teóricas, seminários, aulas práticas, pesquisas, trabalhos de campos, estágios supervisionados, leituras programadas, trabalhos especiais (de acordo com a natureza da disciplina) e excursões programadas pelo departamento. Será aprovado, com direito aos créditos correspondentes, o aluno que obtiver nota final igual ou superior a cinco e tenha, no mínimo setenta por cento de freqüência na disciplina. Sistema de recuperação: Os alunos que não tiverem nota final de aprovação em disciplinas dos cursos de graduação, mas que tiverem obtido freqüência mínima de setenta por cento e nota final não for inferior a três, poderão efetuar uma recuperação que consistirá de provas ou trabalhos programados, a serem realizados entre o final do semestre letivo e o inicio do semestre seguinte.

Surface temperatures of brick walls may be much higher than the ambient air temperature. Wall orienta- tion, color, brick wall type and presence and location of insulation are governing factors. It is possible for a dark, south facing wall to reach surface tempera- tures as high as 140 ºF (60 ºC), while the ambient air temperature is well below 100 ºF (38 ºC). The mean temperature of a 4 in. (102 mm) thick insulated brick veneer is very close to the surface temperature of the brick. A thicker or uninsulated wall may have a lower mean temperature than the outside surface. The tem- perature range experienced by brickwork is the differ- ence of the high and low mean temperatures of the brickwork. In practice, this range is usually taken as 100 ºF (38 ºC) and is based on the annual high and low temperature of the exterior ambient air.

With regard to beta blockers in substance abuse, atenolol has been shown in placebo-controlled trials to be beneficial in alcohol withdrawal [54-56]. Pindolol has been used to treat alcohol withdrawal [57]. Timolol had a minimal effect on a subset of symptoms of patients experiencing alcohol withdrawal [58].With regard to cocaine abuse, propranolol has been used to treat withdrawal and overdoses [59, 60]. Note that propranolol has also been shown to suppress tremors [61], consistent with one of the perceived benefits of beta blockers in performance anxiety in musicians (above).

While many of these symptoms can be seen with other conditions such as allergies, we ask that you seek medical evaluation if you identify any of these symptoms. Loss of taste or smell is very specific to COVID‐19 and may be described as food tasting bland, rather than not being able to taste. If your child develops any of these symptoms, please notify your child’s school, contact your child’s doctor for evaluation/testing, and keep your child home from school.

insomnia. Likewise, the direct effects of over-the-counter and prescription medications and substances (Table 7), and their effects upon withdrawal, may impact both sleep and daytime symptoms. Conditions often comorbid with insomnia, such as mood and anxiety disorders, may also have familial or genetic components. Social and occupational histories may indicate not only the effects of insomnia on the individual, but also possible contributing factors. Occupational assessment should specifi- cally include work around dangerous machinery, driving duties, regular or irregular shift-work and transmeridian travel. Physical and Mental Status Examination: Chronic in- somnia is not associated with any specific features on physi- cal or mental status examination. However, these exams may provide important information regarding comorbid conditions and differential diagnosis. A physical exam should specifically evaluate risk factors for sleep apnea (obesity, increased neck circumference, upper airway restrictions) and comorbid medi- cal conditions that include but are not limited to disorders of pulmonary, cardiac, rheumatologic, neurological, endocrine (such as thyroid), and gastrointestinal systems. The mental sta- tus exam should focus on mood, anxiety, memory, concentra- tion, and degree of alertness or sleepiness. Supporting Information: While a thorough clinical history and exam form the core of the evaluation, differential diagno- sis is further aided by the use of sleep logs, questionnaires for sleep quality, sleepiness, psychological assessment and quality of life (Table 8), and in some cases, actigraphy.21-23 For specific insomnias, psychological testing, quality of life questionnaires, and other comorbid questionnaires and testing are useful. The choice of assessment tools should be based on the patient’s pre- sentation and the clinician’s expertise. At minimum, the patient should complete: (1) A general medical/psychiatric/medication questionnaire (to identify comorbid disorders and medication use) (2) The Epworth Sleepiness Scale or other sleepiness assess- ment (to identify sleepy patients)24 (3) A two-week sleep log to identify sleep-wake times, gen- eral patterns, and day-to-day variability. When possible, questionnaires and a two-week sleep log should be completed prior to the first visit to begin the process

PMPRB allows companies to set prices for new patented drugs up to the highest amount paid for other medicines in the same therapeutic class (an internal reference price), which incentivizes manufacturers to avoid lowering prices for older patented drugs.

Table 4 lists the top features for the best performing fea- ture set, all features. Due to the nonlinear nature of gradient boosted trees, we are unable to exactly determine the po- larity of different features, only their importances, given by the number of times on which they were split. We approxi- mate feature polarity by the difference in average relevance of documents with and without each feature.

•Representante Legal: É aquele que por lei ou declaração judicial está autorizado a contrair direitos e obrigações em nome de um terceiro. De acordo com o Código Civil Brasileiro Art. 1.690, compete aos pais, e na falta de um deles ao outro, com exclusividade, representar os filhos menores de dezesseis anos, bem como assis�-los até a maioridade (com o falecimento dos pais, ou sendo estes julgados ausentes, ou em caso de os pais decaírem do poder familiar, compe�rá ao tutor legal representar o menor até os dezesseis anos e assis�-lo após essa idade - Código Civil Brasileiro Art. 1.747). Dessa maneira, no caso de um paciente menor, caso este seja menor de 16 anos, apenas o representante deverá assinar este termo (“representação”). Já, caso o paciente seja maior de 16 e menor de 18, tanto o representante legal, quanto o paciente, deverão assinar este termo (“assistência”). •Em casos de pacientes maiores de idade, mas que não possam por causa transitória ou permanente manifestar sua vontade, de acordo com o Código Civil Brasilei- ro, estas pessoas devem ser representadas por seu curador, nos termos da lei civil (art. 1767, I, CC).

Regarding Figure 4, it is obvious that with increase in mesh size or decrease in particle size, surface roughness comes down and results in a finer surface. Here again to ensure that graph 2 illustrates general behavior of abrasive particle mesh size, all other conditions were examined and in just one condition a little deviation from regular behavior had been observed. In this case, possible reason for this happening could be increase in cutting edges by increase in mesh number. Besides, the greater the abrasive particles, the bigger their cutting edges are, so scratches made by these bigger cutting edges are greater than smaller particles. Therefore, smaller abrasive particles produce a better surface quality. Finally, to examine effect of finishing time cycle, last set of experiments with the following condition has been conducted: Magnetic field strength of 0.8T, abrasive particle mesh size of 400, finishing cycles of 30, 45 and 60 minutes. Results are shown in Figure 5.

3. Structure and function are reciprocally interrelated. The structure of a body part governs its function, and thus abnormal structure manifests as dysfunction. Func- tion also governs structure. In addition, if the body’s overall structure is suboptimal, its functioning and capacity for self-healing will be inhibited as well.

In this paper, we describe a novel feature space designed to effectively classify the polarity and strength of relationships extracted from biomedical abstracts. In addition to the conventional syntactic features such as unigrams and bigrams, we have also explored and constructed semantics-based sequential features. These features are constructed at three different levels: entity, phrase, and sentence. A wrapper-based method is then used to select the optimal feature sets for both polarity and strength prediction. Specifically, a multi-stage SVM classifier and an SVR predictor are built for polarity and strength prediction, respectively. Two different schemas, namely, (1 vs. all) and (2 vs. 2), are employed to build the multi-stage SVM. Finally, three different kernel functions are considered at different stage of this SVM classifier. Our intensive evaluations have shown that for polarity prediction, the (2 vs. 2) schema in general works better than the (1 vs. all). It produces the highest polarity accuracy of 0.91 when both unigrams and semantics-based sequential structures (KSS) are used, with a standard error ranging between 0.01~0.02. On the other hand, we find that for strength prediction, unigrams solely can produce satisfying results. We obtain a high accuracy of 0.96, with the standard error ranging between 0.61%~0.63% for the strength analysis. We are currently expanding our annotated corpus to facilitate further validation of the findings reported in this work. We are also integrating this module with other modules as shown in Figure 1 towards building a quantitative food-disease-gene network. Finally, we are creating an interactive user interface to visually present this network.

Each framework differs in terms of its audience, development process, and measures of benefit and cost. NCCN and ASCO are patient/provider facing, but ICER is targeted to payers. Methodological transparency also varies: ICER and ASCO have open comment periods and update their approaches based on stakeholder input, while NCCN has no formal public comment process. A comparison of the frameworks on multiple dimensions appears in Tables 1 and 2.

Among antihypertensives in wide use, the complaints of tiredness, fatigue and daytime sleepiness are commonly associated with drugs having antagonistic effects at the norepinephrine neuroreceptor (Dimsdale 1992). The complaints of tiredness, fatigue and daytime sleepiness (2–4.3%) associated with beta-blocker use may occur secondary to disturbed sleep or direct action of the drug. Beta-blocking drugs with vasodilating properties (e.g. carvedilol, labetalol) are also associated with reported fatigue and somnolence (3–11%). Sedation is among the most common side ef- fects reported for the alpha-2 agonists clonidine and methyldopa (30–75%) (AHFS 2003). Alpha-1 antagonists (e.g. terazosin, prazosin) are sometimes associated with transient sedation. Prazosin, a norepinephine antagonist, has demonstrated value in treating insomnia associated with PTSD nightmares (Raskind et al. 2003). Clonidine is sometimes utilized to treat the agitation and insomnia that result from using amphetamines to treat AD/HD in pediatric patients (Ming et al. 2011).

The combustion chamber should be constructed of nominal 4 in. (100 mm) thick brick. When refractory brick or firebrick are used, model building codes permit the total wall thickness to be reduced. Thin mortar joints, not more than 1/4 in.(6.4 mm), should be specified. A 1 in. (25 mm) air space should be provided between the combustion chamber wall and the backup wall, although not required by building codes. This air space provides for thermal expansion of the combustion chamber. A noncombustible, compressible, fibrous insulation or similar material should be wrapped around the combustion chamber to ensure that this air space is maintained. The backup wall should be no less than 4 in. (100 mm) in thickness around the back of the combustion chamber to support the loads from the smoke chamber and chimney above.

The results of fire resistance tests clearly show that brick masonry cavity walls have excellent fire resistance. Fire resistance ratings of brick masonry cavity walls range from 2 to 4 hr, depending upon the wall thickness and other factors (see Table 4). Due to their high fire resistance properties, brick walls make excellent fire walls or building separation walls for compartmentation in buildings. By using compartmentation, the spread of fire can be halted. Technical Notes 16 Series describes fire ratings and applicable design conditions.

Fourth, theory building requires synthesis of different literatures which advance the same goal, namely, to empower the crowd to engage with important scientific issues such as genetic engi- neering, human tissue market development, and other important biomedical research outcomes. This entails a need to build synergies between citizen science theory and other bodies of theory such as informing science, which offer an emergent body of research specifically focused on in- forming stakeholders.

News media are an important source of scientific informa- tion for the public in domains such as health, medicine, and climate change research, making the accurate communica- tion of findings – and patterns of misinformation – a vi- tal issue for society and public policy (Geller, Bernhardt, and Holtzman 2002; Boykoff and Boykoff 2004; Brechman, Lee, and Cappella 2009). A substantial amount of scholarly attention has been devoted to studying the mechanisms by which academic research findings move along and through a chain of translation-oriented intermediaries, from journals anduniversitycommunicationsofficestoreportersandblog- gers and finally to citizen groups and individual members of the public. Journalists’ internal processes of selection and framing news are very significant, as they are an antecedent and structural factor that affects all subsequent issues of public attention. Because parsing and interpreting the methods and results of highly technical scientific papers is a difficult task, journalists may use simple heuristics to determine whether research is novel and of high quality and impact, such as inspecting the name of the journal and the article subjects. An even simpler explanation is that journalists may publish Copyright c (cid:13) 2018, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.

AASM practice parameter papers are based on evidence- based review and grading of literature, often addressing a spe- cific issue or topic. Clinical guidelines provide clinicians with a working overview for disease or disorder evaluation and man- agement. These guidelines include practice parameter papers and also include areas with limited evidence in order to provide a comprehensive practice guideline. Both practice parameters and clinical guidelines define principles of practice that should meet the needs of most patients. They should not, however, be considered exhaustive, inclusive of all available methods of care, or exclusive of other methods of care reasonably expected to obtain the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding appropriateness of any specific therapy must be made by the clinician and patient in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible

To put these figures in perspective, the average monthly healthcare spending for people in our data diagnosed with type 2 diabetes was about $1,600 in 2014.19 Pre-diagnosis, cancer patients spent, on average, less than diabetes patients. The post-diagnosis monthly healthcare spending for the three cancers studied stabilized near or above the diabetes patient level after several months. This finding suggests that, for survivors, a diagnosis of cancer, like the diagnosis of a chronic condition, results in persistent healthcare spending.

Pain assessment involves more than just quantifying theintensityofpain.Highpainintensityratingsorbehav- ioralscalescoresthatdonotrespondtousualcareshould be investigated to determine whether the pain might be due to a new medical issue or surgical complication and the potential role of opioid tolerance and psychological distress. Assessment should determine what interven- tions have been effective for the pain, how the pain af- fects function, the type of pain (eg, neuropathic, visceral, somatic, muscle spasms), and whether there are barriers to effective pain management, such as cultural orlanguagedifferences,cognitivedeficits,orpatientmis- conceptions about pain management (Table 2). In addi- tion, it is not sufficient to assess pain only at rest. Pain that is relativelywell controlled at rest canbe severe dur- ing movement or with specific activities that cause increased pain (eg, swallowing after tonsillectomy), with important implications for symptom management and recovery. The panel suggests that clinicians assess pain at rest and with activities, as the latter is often more severe and difficult to control than pain at rest.110,270 Presence of pain with activity has important implications for use of additional interventions and discharge planning. For example, pain that is well controlled at rest but severe with movement can have major effects on a patient’s ability to participate in postsurgical rehabilitation and return to normal function, and pain with swallowing after tonsillectomy could increase risk for dehydration. Assessments for other clinical issues such as sedation, delirium, and nausea or other side effects related to interventions are also important to help guide decisions regarding adjustmentofthe postoperativepain management plan. There is insufficient evidence to guide firm recom- mendations on optimal timing or frequency of patient reassessments in the postoperative setting. The timing of assessments after administration of an intervention should be informed by the time to achieve peak ef- fects, which is typically 15 to 30 minutes after paren- teral drug therapy or 1 to 2 hours after administration of an oral analgesic. With nonpharma- cologic interventions, pain relief often occurs during or immediately after their application. The optimal fre- quency of reassessment is likely to depend on a num- ber of factors, including the type of surgical procedure, the adequacy of initial pain relief, the pres- ence of side effects, presence of comorbidities, and

Despite the chorus of concerns, existing regulatory and non-regulatory measures do not seem to have suitably resulted in outcomes that meet both policy and economic objectives, as well as public expectations. Stakeholders continue to voice their concerns about the lack of adequate access to both new and off-patent essential cancer medicines. Furthermore, the prices of cancer medicines continue to rise significantly, possibly disproportionally to the benefits conferred and to the extent that the financial sustainability of

In this paper we present an analysis of news coverage of sci- entific articles across various disciplines, universities, jour- nals, and news outlets. After filtering out press release and abstractissuanceandcopierwebsites,weapproachtheprob- lem as a ranking one. For a given period of time, we learn to rank scientific articles by the amount of news coverage they receive. We find that textual features significantly im- prove the accuracy of the prediction over metadata features, with abstract and press release features providing the largest boost in accuracy. We find the most important feature to be whether the scientific article has a press release published
The methods of exposure assessment will be extracted and whether the method has been validated, the number of items in the questionnaires and the number of assessments. The duration of the exposure/intervention will be recorded as well as the time between exposure assessment/intervention and outcome assessment.

Resistance to transmission of sound in masonry construction is accomplished in two ways: the use of heavy massive walls or the use of discontinuous construction. The cavity wall employs both techniques, i.e., the massiveness of the two masonry wythes plus the partial discontinuity of the cavity.

ACGME residency, compared to the 94.40 percent U.S. MD NRMP match rate in the same year. Percentages of allopathic and osteopathic students who matched in specific specialties (see Table 4-3) showed that there were some important distinctions in proportions of graduates (DO vs. U.S. MD) going into certain fields, namely Family Medicine, Pediatrics, and Emergency Med- icine. Despite the common misconception that highly competitive specialties are not open to DO graduates, sig- nificant numbers of DOs enter such fields as orthopedic surgery, anesthesiology, and diagnostic radiology. Several limitations of this data analysis were acknowl- edged by the contributing SDN member, Jimmy DeMeo, who is currently an osteopathic medical student at Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine (LECOM) and the national Student Osteopathic Medical Association (SOMA) president. For instance, the analysis did not take into con- sideration how applicants ranked specialties, whether or not they matched into their top choice of specialty, mul- tiple match attempts, post-match placement, or scramble results. It also did not include results from the San Fran- cisco matching program, which is a third system apart from the AOA and NRMP that matches applicants to a few highly competitive specialties, including neurology, oph- thalmology, and plastic surgery.

Pain assessment involves more than just quantifying theintensityofpain.Highpainintensityratingsorbehav- ioralscalescoresthatdonotrespondtousualcareshould be investigated to determine whether the pain might be due to a new medical issue or surgical complication and the potential role of opioid tolerance and psychological distress. Assessment should determine what interven- tions have been effective for the pain, how the pain af- fects function, the type of pain (eg, neuropathic, visceral, somatic, muscle spasms), and whether there are barriers to effective pain management, such as cultural orlanguagedifferences,cognitivedeficits,orpatientmis- conceptions about pain management (Table 2). In addi- tion, it is not sufficient to assess pain only at rest. Pain that is relativelywell controlled at rest canbe severe dur- ing movement or with specific activities that cause increased pain (eg, swallowing after tonsillectomy), with important implications for symptom management and recovery. The panel suggests that clinicians assess pain at rest and with activities, as the latter is often more severe and difficult to control than pain at rest.110,270 Presence of pain with activity has important implications for use of additional interventions and discharge planning. For example, pain that is well controlled at rest but severe with movement can have major effects on a patient’s ability to participate in postsurgical rehabilitation and return to normal function, and pain with swallowing after tonsillectomy could increase risk for dehydration. Assessments for other clinical issues such as sedation, delirium, and nausea or other side effects related to interventions are also important to help guide decisions regarding adjustmentofthe postoperativepain management plan. There is insufficient evidence to guide firm recom- mendations on optimal timing or frequency of patient reassessments in the postoperative setting. The timing of assessments after administration of an intervention should be informed by the time to achieve peak ef- fects, which is typically 15 to 30 minutes after paren- teral drug therapy or 1 to 2 hours after administration of an oral analgesic. With nonpharma- cologic interventions, pain relief often occurs during or immediately after their application. The optimal fre- quency of reassessment is likely to depend on a num- ber of factors, including the type of surgical procedure, the adequacy of initial pain relief, the pres- ence of side effects, presence of comorbidities, and

When the mechanisms causing the efflorescing salts to appear have been established and the sources of salts or moisture are identified (usually the latter), suitable corrections must be addressed. Solutions to efflorescence prob- lems usually involve reducing water penetration into the masonry and removing the efflorescence from the wall. Recommendations for the correction of water penetration in masonry walls are contained in Technical Note 46.

The 5- and 10-year relative survival rates for colorectal cancer are 65% and 58%, respectively. When colorectal cancer is detected at an early stage, the 5-year survival rate is 90% (Figure 5, page 9); however, only 39% of cases are diagnosed at this stage (Figure 4, page 8), in part due to the underuse of screening.

There are debates about whether the returns generated from the sales of medicines, including cancer medicines, are sufficient for pharmaceutical companies to cover their past R&D expenses, maintain their operations and engage in future drug discovery research. For example, some commentators have observed that the revenue generated from the sales of imatinib had exceeded the costs of R&D within two years and “the revenues over the subsequent years of the patent would represent generous profits to the company” (30). Another study found that total revenue from the sales of 10 cancer medicines since approval over a median of four years (US$ 67.0 billion) was 9.3 times the total R&D spending of US$ 7.2 billion (or 7.4 times using an estimated risk-adjusted R&D costs of US$ 9.1 billion) (94).

The industry also often justifies prices of medicine by stating that return on investment needs to be sufficient to incentivize the discovery of future medicines (109). To this point, the industry noted that 20% of its revenues were re-invested into R&D (87).

6. Evaluating – can include commenting on the degrees of success and failure of something, or the value of something The ability to analyze and creatively adapt to new situations is at the heart of critical thinking. Paul and Elder (2008, 2014b) asserted that critical thinking provides a vehicle for educating the mind. John Dewey would agree, as from his early work, we have increased our sense of the pragmatic basis of human thought (its instrumental nature), and especially its grounding in actual human purposes, goals, and objectives. Dewey (1910) also discussed critical thinking in terms of reflective thinking, which is an uneasiness in accepting the status quo and that critical thinking is both an emotional and intellectual component. Students must, therefore, be taught to examine, poke, question, and reflect on what they have learned. Scepticism, questioning, and reflection is essential. Dewey also stated that schools should have an intimate relationship with the community it serves. From the review of the research concerning critical thinking and what components are considered important in high school education and later a life-long learning skill, the authors developed a 5-step, critical thinking teaching process as outlined in Table 2. Input from the study’s nine experts who reviewed the model and from suggestions from other model developers, led to the selection of easy to remember letters that describe each step’s process.

Journalists act as gatekeepers to the scientific world, control- ling what information reaches the public eye and how it is presented. Analyzing the kinds of research that typically re- ceive more media attention is vital to understanding issues such as the “science of science communication” (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2017), patterns of misinformation, and the “cycle of hype.” We track the coverage of 91,997 scientific articles published in 2016 across various disciplines, publishers, and news outlets us- ing metadata and text data from a leading tracker of sci- entific coverage in social and traditional media, Altmetric. We approach the problem as one of ranking each day’s, or week’s, papers by their likely level of media attention, us- ing the learning-to-rank model lambdaMART (Burges 2010). We find that ngram features from the title, abstract and press release significantly improve performance over the metadata features journal, publisher, and subjects.

Many countries continue to apply tariffs on imported medicines, access to medicines (198). Many countries also apply VAT to medicines, although VAT rates are generally reduced for medicines compared to the standard tax rates (200). Nonetheless, VAT can make medicines unaffordable while not substantially contributing to revenue goals (e.g. ≈1% of public revenue) (198,201).

The statewide assessments in mathematics, reading, and science are used to measure whether students, and their school and district, are meeting the academic standards. Statewide assessments are one measure of how well students are doing on the content that is part of their daily instruction. It is also a measure of how well schools and districts are doing in aligning their curriculum and teaching the standards.

Resistance to antimalarial drugs has been described for two of the four species of malaria parasite that naturally infect humans, P. falciparum and P. vivax. P. falciparum has developed resistance to nearly all antimalarials in current use, although the geo- graphical distribution of resistance to any single antimalarial drug varies greatly (Table 3). P. vivax infection acquired in some areas has been shown to be resistant to chloroquine and/or primaquine (44, 45). Chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum malaria has

We find 8,436 matched pairs. We train logistic regres- sion with the same train-test split (days 1-277, days 278- 365). Using all features, logistic regression achieves an F1 of 0.6037. Although many of the positive feature are sensi- ble and similar to those found in the ranking experiments and previous research (Wallace, Paul, and Elhadad 2015; Zhang et al. 2016), we find that the negative features are dominated by alzheimers and dementia related terms in the title and abstract. These results are indicative of an oddity in the dataset provided by Altmetric, specifically the web- site Alzforum. Alzforum is an information resource web- site for alzheimers researchers and is one of the websites included in Altmetric’s news crawl. Most of the Alzforum articles tracked by Altmetric post only article metadata, and the website was marked as a non-news source due to its super high rate of publication. Before sampling, Alzforum covers 8,347 of the 34,329 scientific articles with no real coverage and is the highest frequency outlet on that subset. However, it covers only 667 of the 57,668 scientific articles with real coverage. Of 8,436 matched pairs, Alzforum cov- ers 1,380 negative and 224 positive samples. Although we control for subjects, they are typically more general, such as “neuroscience,” “psychology and cognitive sciences,” and “geriatrics and gerontology.” Thus, we are unable to control for specific topics, such as alzheimers, and logistic regres- sion learns that most alzheimers articles are unpopular.

1989). In the 1990’s newer agents were developed and marketed that had selective effects on GABA receptors in- cluding Zolpidem (Ambien), Zaleplon (Sonata), Eszopi- clone (Estorra) and Indiplon. While all hypnotics have abuse potential for individuals with addictive histories and personalities, these agents have been noted to have min- imal additive potential (Hajak et al. 2003). These agents are less likely to have deleterious side effects than most OTC treatments for insomnia, however, with increased use, more side effects including next effects on driving have been reported. This effect as well as next day re- bound insomnia has particularly been reported for higher doses of zolpidem (Verster et al. 2002). In many cases, MVA’s occurred in the period of somnolence and cogni- tive impairment during the first few hours after ingestion. Comparatively normal results on psychomotor tests can be obtained 3.25 h. after zaleplon ingestion and 6.25 h. after zopiclone ingestion (Paul et al. 2003). While these agents have excellent efficacy with minimal side effects, at higher doses these agents can exhibit benzodiazepine-like effects. Idiosyncratic reactions of persistent daytime som- nolence and/or memory loss have been reported. Some patients will report next day sedation after the nighttime use of these agents, as well as demonstrate an increased error rate in driving tests (Verster et al. 2007). Such infor- mation was forthcoming only after these drugs became generic and widely utilized in clinical practice. Most sedat- ing drugs if adopted into such widespread use would also be at least as likely to demonstrate epidemiological effects on MVA’s and MVA associated deaths. In the elderly, chronic use of sedating drugs (particularly those with anti-cholinergic side effects) can be associated with an increased risk for falls, and confusion (American Geriatrics Society 2015). Reported next day sleepiness and other side effects associated with hypnotic use are summarized in Table 3. The newer GABA-effective hypnotics are the only medications with demonstrated effectiveness in treating chronic insomnia (NIH State of the Science Conference

Your child has been identified as needing services for English Language Learners (ELL). Your child will be placed in the ESL/Bilingual Education dual language immersion program, as outlined in the attached document. We believe that this program will help meet your child’s educational needs and enhance his/her academic success in school. Your child will be assessed twice yearly, or as needed, to determine progress toward individual ELL goals. When your child scores in the acceptable range (4.5 Literacy/5.0 Overall) on all areas of the W-APT or ACCESS assessment they will be exited from the program. If your student currently has an Individualized Education Program (IEP), their needs will continue to be met through their current accommodations.

1. Describing – by clearly defining what you are talking about, what specifically was involved, where it took place and under what circumstances. 2. Reflecting – reconsidering a topic by taking into account new information or a new experience, or considering other viewpoints. 3. Analyzing – examining and then explaining how something is, including comparing and contrasting different elements and understanding relationships to your subject/topic. 4. Critiquing – identifying and examining weaknesses in arguments, as well as acknowledging its strengths. It’s important to think of critiquing as ‘neutral’ and not negative. 5. Reasoning – using methods such as cause and effect to demonstrate logical thinking, as well as presenting evidence that either refutes or proves an argument.

The IOM report supports these findings, stating that diagnostic errors contribute to 10% of patient deaths and 6-17% of hospital adverse events. Other researchers quantify the human cost of diagnostic errors at between 40,000 and 80,000 deaths per year.9 These troubling findings make developing effective methods to prevent diagnostic errors an urgent priority.

With the opening and flue sizes known, Equation 4 may be used to calculate the minimum chimney height to provide adequate draft in a properly designed, detailed and constructed assembly. The height calculated using Equation 4 is measured from the top of the fireplace opening, and is the minimum required to produce an adequate draft. Building code requirements previously discussed for minimum chimney heights are based solely on fire safety considerations and must always be met or exceeded.

Although, it was assumed that the 'thicker' articles with wider range of vocabulary is preferable in the editors hands, the editors (and probably the readers) prefer simple, clear and coherent writing, rather than a fancy or complex, pseudo-scientific style. Also Funkhouser and Maccoby (1971) showed that the information gain is especially enhanced by the “use of examples", i.e. it helps a lot to use some non-science material, such as everyday life parallels, historical points, etc. On the other hand, some sections, such as Introduction and Discussion, have to intrigue readers and attract interest and should therefore not be over-simplified. For example, a mysterious title can catch readers' attention and will be easily remembered (e.g.: T.Y. Li and J. Yorke named their famous paper on chaos: "The period three means chaos"). Some sections require more skill and are more important. It is approximated that from all published journal RAs in the world, only less than 5% are read in detail. However, more than 50% of abstracts are read and so the quality of an abstracts is much more important (Gordon, 1983). Therefore, the abstract should present the 'story' of the RA in miniature and should be readable standalone.

Researchers must read papers for several reasons: to re- view them for a conference or a class, to keep current in their field, or for a literature survey of a new field. A typi- cal researcher will likely spend hundreds of hours every year reading papers.

Ultimately, managed entry agreements require political consensus and considerable practical effort. American payers have typically been reticent to say no to covering drugs, and MEAs are built on the capacity to deny coverage for some treatments. The technical complexity of MEAs present additional implementation barriers; for example, the administrative burdens and complexity of collecting data and managing agreements with different manufacturers are considerable. Should MEAs be adopted more widely by private insurers, the discounted prices are likely to remain confidential. Finally, MEAs do not resolve underlying controversies regarding appropriate comparator drugs, measures of clinical efficacy, or how to build in other patient considerations.
Valid and appropriate clinical documentation (e.g., medical visit notes, therapy logs, prescriptions) must be

the context description CUI→ST obtains the high- est overall accuracy. On the con(cid:3)ated dataset, the pseudowords a a, a o, d d and e e have a corresponding CUI de(cid:2)ni- tion for each of their possible concepts therefore the accuracy for CUI and CUI→ would be the same for these datasets and is not reported. The pseudowords a a i, x p p and d a m e do not have a CUI de(cid:2)ni- tions for each of their possible concepts. The results show that CUI obtained the highest accuracy for six out of the seven datasets and CUI→ST obtained the highest accuracy for one. These experiments were run using the unigram feature.

In the future, we would also like to increase the size of our con(cid:3)ated dataset and possibly create a biomedical all-words disambiguation test set to test our approach. Unlike SenseClusters, our approach can be used to perform all-words disambiguation. For example, given the sentence: His weight has fluctuated during the past month. We (cid:2)rst create a instance vector containing fluctuated, past and months for the word weight and a concept vector for each of its possible concepts, (cid:147)C0005912: Body Weight(cid:148) and (cid:147)C0699807: Quantitative Concept(cid:148) us- ing their context descriptions. We then calculate the cosine between the instance vector and each of the two concept vectors. The concept whose vector has the smallest cosine score is assigned to weight. We then repeat this process for fluctuated, past and months. We also plan to explore using different contex- tual information to improve the accuracy of our approach. We are currently exploring using co- occurrence and relational information about the pos- sible CUIs in the UMLS. Our IDF stoplist exper-

Participants agreed that some RA, even with good data and interesting results, will be rejected if the style and format of the paper are not tailored for the audience. This agrees with the results of investigations among 116 editors (Gosden, 1992; Fig. 1), who identified following most frequent causes to reject an L2 author: unclear text, incoherent development of the topic in paragraphs and incorrect use of grammar. In addition, the participants analysed an exemplary flawed paper by unknown author and decided to reject it after some discussion. The list of reasons for rejection can be seen in Table 1.

The growing expenditure and high prices of cancer medicines have attracted an extensive body of commentary from diverse stakeholders in recent years. Stakeholders at all levels – from patients and clinicians to governments – have expressed their concerns that such high prices would compromise the availability and affordability of these medicines to patients, as well as the sustainability of health systems.

Free access to scientific articles increases readership (as measured by article downloads) and reaches a broader audience (as measured by unique IP addresses) but has no effect on article citations within the first 3 yr after publication. These results are consistent with earlier trial reports on the physiology literature (14, 15) and suggest that these claims are generalizable across the scientific, social sciences, and humanities literatures.

Sport-specific rules may not allow adequate time for evaluation, and modifying these rules remains an area for improvement within the governing bodies of some sports. (C) When the sports medicine clinician becomes aware of a poten- tial injury, the athlete is approached and a brief history of the event is obtained from the athlete and those who witnessed the event or athlete behaviour. How the athlete responds to the elements of orientation, memory, concentration and balance is evaluated, as well as speech patterns and how the athlete appears to be processing information.

The use of two antimalarials simultaneously, especially when the antimalarials have different mechanisms of action, has the potential for inhib- iting the development of resistance to either of the components. The efficacy of a combination of a 4-aminoquinoline drug (either chloroquine or amo- diaquine) with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine has been reviewed (43). The results of this review sug- gested that the addition of either chloroquine or amodiaquine to SP marginally improved parasitological clearance (compared with SP alone). The studies reviewed were mostly done in areas and at times when both SP and chloroquine/amodi- aquine retained a fair amount of efficacy, and it is not clear from these studies how well such a combination would act in areas where one of the components was significantly compromised. Additionally, to date, there are no data to suggest whether this slightly improved clearance would

The numbers in each block are codes for the treatment given to each animal. The purpose of such a design is to reduce heterogeneity associated with time, space and some physical varia- tion. The five animals in Block 1 would be chosen to be as similar as possible with respect to age, weight, genotype and any other variable which might influence the outcome. They would then be assigned at random to one of the five treatments. The animals would be housed in close proximity, and possibly even in the same cage, if the different treatments can be given in such a situation. When measurements are to be made on the animals, those in Block 1 would be treated as a group, with all measurements being made within a short period by the same per- son. Animals in the other blocks would likewise be selected to be as uniform as possible, but might differ in body weight or age, etc. from those in Block 1. They could be measured at a dif- ferent time, if necessary by a different person. Thus, within each block any comparison among treatments would be made on animals which are in all possible ways as similar as possible. The unwanted variation shows up as differences between blocks. This is then removed mathe- matically in the statistical analysis.

The temperature change used for estimating thermal movements should be based on mean temperatures in the component. For solid masonry walls, tempera- tures at the center of the wall should be used. In cav- ity walls and veneers, the temperature at the center of each wythe or component should be used. In dis- continuous construction, the wythes will have different temperatures due to the separation of the wythes by an air space and perhaps insulation.

was achieved using 2 complementary approaches, mir- roring the approaches used in the first 2 phases: data- informed and consensus-based. From the consensus- based approach, the expert panel was asked to examine the rankings of case scenarios based on the new scoring system and to indicate, in their opinion, the point at which the cases changed from “probable” to “definite” RA. Four cases were excluded due to missing domain information (n (cid:2) 2) or ineligibility (2 cases were more likely another diagnosis). For the remaining 50 cases, the mean cut point defining definite RA was 65.7 (median 66.1; range 60.0–70.3) of a total possible score of 100. A data-driven verification of that cut point was then attempted, in which the new scoring system was applied to 3 of the existing cohorts used for Phase 1 (the Etude et Suivi des Polyarthrites Indifferenciees Re- centes data set from France, the Norwegian data set, and the Rotterdam Early Arthritis Cohort data set from Rotterdam) (25). These cohorts were chosen based on the completeness of data and the collected variables, enabling calculation of the patients’ probability scores at baseline. The disease characteristics of these cohorts were not substantively different from those of the re- maining cohorts (data not shown). The area under the curve (AUC) for the 3 receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (which plot sensitivity against 1 (cid:3) specificity for the range of scores) indicated good discrimination of those who did versus those who did not receive MTX (or another DMARD/biologic agent) within a year (AUC 0.82 for Norway, 0.66 for France, and AUC 0.69 for Rotterdam; P (cid:4) 0.0001 for all). The probability scores similarly discriminated between those who fulfilled the 1987 ACR criteria at 12 months and those who did not (AUC for the ROC curves 0.88 [Norway], 0.67 [France], and 0.72 [Rotterdam]). Visual inspection of the diagnostic test parameters associated with curves that used MTX initi- ation as the outcome showed a maximum slope for both the positive and negative likelihood ratios between a score of 60/100 and 70/100, with flattening thereafter (67 in the Norway cohort, 66 in the French cohort, and 66 in the Rotterdam cohort). The cut point of 60–70 that was derived from expert consensus was therefore supported by these data. Given the consistency with the consensus- based approach, and to maximize sensitivity of the criteria, a cut point of 60 was deemed to be most appropriate. Rationale for the composition and weight of the final criteria. For development of the final criteria set, the results and weights from the comprehensive Phase 2 process (26) were used as a starting point. Based on

Preparing students to be able to think critically is one of the key goals for many professionals in higher education, and it is also a quality sought by most employers of university graduates (Sulaiman, Rahman, & Dzulkifli, 2008). Under a Thailand 4.0 vision, critical thinking skills are stated to be a key pillar among the goals for a new, knowledge-based economy (Jones & Pimdee, 2017). These skills, however, are limited, as according to a recent study evaluating logical thinking and analytical skills, of 6,235 students in ten Thai provinces, the average final score was just 36.5%, with only 2.09% passing the exam (Rujivanarom, 2016). Over 2,500 years ago Plato in his discussions of logic indicated that critical thinking is the tool that helps individuals find answers or solutions to a person’s confusions and problems (Thayer-Bacon, 1998). Socrates, Plato’s teacher, believed that discussion and critical thinking with knowledge reside in the mind of the individual, rather than a teacher transmitting knowledge to a student (Ornstein & Levine, 2006). Nearly 2,500 years later, scholars and educators are still discussing the mechanisms, importance, and outcomes of critical thinking skills (or lack thereof). Contemporary evidence of the importance of critical thinking skills for employment has been provided from the National Association of Colleges and Employers [NACE] (2016) which indicated that critical thinking/problem-solving skills were ranked most important by the 144 surveyed employers (Table 1). This is also consistent with the research results obtained by Bassham, Irwin, Nardone, and Wallace (2013) which indicated that college education is responsible for the development of critical thinking skills which, in their turn, lead to higher-order thinking. This is also consistent with (Costa & Kallick, 2014) who stated that critical thinking skills are consistently included in all the lists of essentials behind college and career readiness (Kraisuth & Panjakajornsak, 2017).

Sexual problems after cancer treatment affect survivors of many different cancers, including breast, bladder, colorectal, prostate, and gynecological.41-44 Issues vary greatly in severity and tend not to be resolved unless specific treatments are provided, which may include medical therapies; non-hormonal, water-based lubricants and moisturizers; and psychoeducational support, group therapy, sexual counseling, marital counseling, or psychotherapy.45
For patients undergoing surgery, an ostomy (creation of an abdominal opening, or stoma, for elimination of body waste) may be needed. A colostomy is when a stoma is created from the large intestine, and an ileostomy is when it is created from the small intestine. In many cases, once the colon or rectum heals,

Clear water repellents, silicone and acrylic coatings are among the solutions often sug- gested for preventing efflorescence. A coating may prevent efflorescence from recurring by reducing the amount of water absorbed by an exposed masonry surface. However, applying a coating to brickwork that has a tendency to effloresce, without stopping the mechanisms causing that efflorescence, may lead to deg- radation of the masonry. Further, applying a coating that inhibits evaporation of water from the masonry may also lead to degradation.

In cavity wall construction, the prescribed air space acts as an insulating layer in addition to the masonry units. Thermal performance of the system can be further enhanced by placing insulation materials in the cavity. Insulation materials used in brick masonry cavity walls include inorganic cellular materials such as perlite and vermiculite, and organic cellular materials such as polystyrene, polyurethane, polyisocyanurate and foams. These insulation types are manufactured in the form of rigid boards, granular fills and foams. Each of these types, if properly used, will result in a more thermally efficient wall system. Although the most important characteristic for insulation is its thermal resistance, other properties should be considered including water absorption, combustibility, density, insect resistance and ease of installation. The following criteria can be used for the selection of insulation materials for brick masonry cavity walls:

Structural clay tile has been used as a backing material for cavity wall construction. Structural clay tile for this purpose should conform to ASTM C 126, ASTM C 34 Specification for Structural Clay Load-Bearing Wall Tile or ASTM C 212 for Structural Clay Facing Tile. Clay tile units under ASTM C 126 and ASTM C 212 are commonly used for the interior wythe of a cavity wall when left exposed for architectural appearance reasons.

The inclusion of SPX Weeklys in the VIX Index calculation means that the near-term options will always have more than 23 days to expiration and the next-term options always have less than 37 days to expiration, so the resulting VIX Index value will always reflect an interpolation of σ2 1 and σ2 2 ; i.e., each individual weight is less than or equal to 1 and the sum of the weights equals 1.

Dose ranging test: Here, compounds are tested at a minimum of 4 different doses (the “dose ranging, full 4-day test”, typically 100, 30, 10 and 3 mg/kg, by both s.c. and p.o. routes of administration). ED 50 and ED 90 values are calculated by plotting the log dose against probit activity (for example, using Microcal “Origin”). These reflect the drug concentrations at which 50% and 90% of suppression of parasitemia is achieved. Note that with short half-life drugs it may be necessary to dose multiple times per day. Two other parameters measured in this study are relative potency compared to an appropriate standard drug, and oral bioavailability (assessed by comparison of oral and parenteral administration).

Another beta blocker is nadolol, which is non-selective and with a preference for beta-1 receptors. It does not pass through the blood-brain barrier. In a clinical trial with musicians, nadolol reduced pulse rate and improved one aspect of performance related to tremor [48]. A similar result was obtained for nadolol in students’ singing performance [49]. In spite of being non- selective, nadolol might ironically benefit the pulmonary function in asthma patients based upon the appropriate dosage, an anti-intuitive result [50].

The implications of the significant dispersion of prices are at least threefold. Firstly, it indicates that existing procurement practices in some countries may not be the most efficient, as lower prices could have been achieved. Secondly, it may impair the countries’ coverage of essential cancer medicines when prices are higher than their ability to fund and provide the medicines. This would, in turn, have a negative impact on patients' timely access to medicines and their ability to achieve the best possible health outcomes. Thirdly, regional price differences within a country may cause inequitable access, with only some patients having access to the medicines at lower prices.

twice, for the hundreds of medicines developed at least with partial support from public resources (340). This raises an important question: does the public have the right to expect governments to play a greater role in exercising more stringent pricing regulations, or simply, by imposing lower prices for cancer medicines in order to realize a more direct financial return for public investment on behalf of the tax-payers? Another pertinent question is whether the ongoing push by research outputs from publicly-funded universities have tilted the pharmaceutical industry at the expense of the tax-payers (342). relationship between the government, industry and university (343).

To further illustrate the possible association between stronger price regulations and lower medicine prices, an analysis was undertaken to compare the real price indices for pharmaceuticals in Australia and the USA from 1981 to 2017. This index indicates the change in price level for pharmaceuticals relative to the change in price level for all goods and services (i.e. all-item consumer price index) against a nominated baseline year (i.e. 1981). These two countries were chosen for illustrative purpose because of their contrasting health care systems and approaches for managing medicine prices: the Australian Government is known to have implemented a range of pricing policies for medicines over the past decades for its single-payer national pharmaceutical insurance scheme – the PBS; the USA on the other hand is known for its market-based health care, with multiple private and public insurers and with minimal government intervention for the pricing of medicines.

In addition to providing direct contribution towards the discovery of medical research, governments in many countries have also implemented a range of indirect measures to incentivize R&D. These include allowing private companies to claim high-level tax credits or deductions for activities related to R&D (Table 4.5).

Throughout the history of medicine, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has played a significant role in the treatment of cancer patients. In 1999, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) created the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) in recognition of this growing field. Research funding to the NCCAM has risen from $ 2 million in 1992 to $50 million by 2000 and is expected to be more than $110 million by the mid-2000’s [1]. A survey conducted in 2005 indicated that approximately 35.9% of cancer patients attempted use of CAM during their treatment course [2]. In fact, that percentage may be even higher as studies have shown that many patients do not disclose the use of CAM therapy unless asked specifically [3]. Physicians poorly communicate with their patients regarding the potential benefits or harms of CAM because they have minimal understanding of CAM therapy and its physiological role in managing diseases [4,5]. Patients are often dissatisfied with their physicians’ lack of knowledge regarding CAM therapy [6]. Patients who have a history of incorporating CAM into their management plan are generally driven by personal beliefs and principles regarding life and health [7]. An increased use of CAM has been seen in patients with increased psychosocial stress or poor prognosis at initial diagnosis [8,9]. Additionally, females and younger patients have a higher predilection for using CAM therapy [10]. There are numerous modalities of CAM such as spiritual healing or prayer, herbal medicine, and chiropractics [11]. This review focuses on medicinal therapies used as CAM for patients suffering from malignancy, specifically lung cancer.

Medical misdiagnosis, in the form of inaccurate, late, and delayed diagnoses, is an ongoing problem in the U.S. Not only do these diagnostic errors present an ongoing risk to the health and safety of patients, but they also cost the economy billions of dollars.
The rising cost of health care (Saxe et al., 2008), coupled with multiple unmet needs, equates to multiple CAM uses (Mao et al., 2008). These unmet needs were identified by Mao et al. (2008) as emotional, physical, nutritional, financial, informational, treatment- and employment-related, and daily living activi- ties. Other reasons included an identified dissatisfaction with conventional care (Richardson et al., 2000; Saxe et al., 2008), fragmentation of care into survivorship, lack of empathy and support, or if a survivor’s subsequent needs were unfulfilled (Mao et al., 2008). In addition, Carpenter et al. (2008) identi- fied decreased emotional function and multiple medical issues in very long-term breast cancer survivors who used CAM. The potential for recurrence and high levels of worry (Mao et al., 2008) and distress (Lawsin et al., 2007) also were reported with increased use. Finally, the use of herbal supplements were reportedly used to reduce the side effects of treatment and to boost immune function (Buettner et al., 2006; Deng et al., 2004; Lawsin et al., 2007; Richardson et al., 2000; Saxe et al., 2008).

OOP costs in the year of diagnosis came mostly from professional and non-inpatient facility services. Figure 8 shows the level of OOP costs by percentile for all study cancers combined. In general, patient cost-sharing is higher for out-of-network services than in-network. Not surprisingly, cancer patients in the highest decile of OOP spending also incurred the highest portion of OOP costs for out- of-network providers; conversely, patients in the lowest decile incurred the lowest portion of OOP costs for out-of-network providers.

And finally, it should be noted that your July 15 letter to Bill Turner of Anvil Mining misstates the status of the “norms” on business and human rights. That document was explicitly rejected by the UN Commission on Human Rights, which stated that the draft "has not been requested by the Commission and, as a draft proposal, has no legal standing, and that the Sub-Commission should not perform any monitoring function in this regard."

CAM specific to lung cancer has focused on therapeutic options that may have less systemic toxicity compared to current chemotherapy options such as Gemcitabine, Paclitaxel, and Etoposide. Herbal plants that have been used in lung cancer therapy include Platycodon grandiflorum (Campanulaceae), Morus alba (Moraceae), Prunus armeniaca (Rosaceae), Rhus verniciflua (Anacardiaceae), Perilla frutescens (Labiatae), Stemona japonica (Stemonaceae), Tusilago farfara (Compositae), and Draba nemorosa (Brassicaceae) [12]. Although these are used as alternative modes of therapy, it is more common for herbal remedies to be used as adjuvant modalities with chemotherapy [13]. The role of these herbal therapies is multifactorial. They can be used to reduce chemotherapy-induced toxicity, mitigate cancer-related symptoms, or directly increase anti- cancer effects [14]. A randomized control trial (RCT) of 61 patients evaluated the use of herbal medications as adjuvant therapy and showed an enhancement in median survival in the group that was treated with Sheng-mai and Gu- jin Granule along with Navelbine and Cisplatin [15]. This group had a 48.5% increase in survival compared to 32.2% in the control arm that only received the two chemotherapy drugs. Another study enrolled 232 non-small cell lung cancer patients and showed that Shenqi-fuzheng, an herbal injection similar to Sheng- mai, served as a useful adjuvant to chemotherapy by improving quality of life [16]. Similarly another RCT of 121 patients with advanced non- small cell lung cancer showed improved quality of life and a trend towards increase in survival time in patients assigned to Kangliuzengxiao and Feiyanning in addition to chemotherapy [17]. Fiji Recipe therapy has been shown to alleviate chemotherapy side effects and enhance therapeutic efficacy [18]. Similarly, other studies have demonstrated the benefits of CAM therapy in mitigating the adverse effects of chemotherapy, including myalgia and diarrhea [19,20]. A case report showed regression of small cell lung cancer with the use of Chinese herbal medicines [21]. Lastly, another case report

Reembolso é o ressarcimento das despesas decorrentes dos atendimentos ocorridos na área de abrangência geográfica da cobertura contratual sempre que não for possível a utilização dos serviços de prestadores da rede credenciada de cada plano. Para os planos que não possuem Livre Escolha (reembolso), os beneficiários deverão entrar em contato com o SAC buscando uma alternativa de atendimento no município onde o serviço ou o procedimento for demandado, desde que dentro da área de abrangência do Plano. O prazo para resposta é de até 7 (sete) dias úteis após a solicitação, caso não haja solução a Operadora concederá autorização de reembolso, sendo necessário apresentar o número de protocolo disponibilizado pela Central de Atendimento no contato inicial. Os beneficiários dos produtos 160 PLUS, 180 PLUS, 318 EXECUTIVO I e 318 EXECUTIVO II, poderão escolher qualquer prestador de serviços legalmente habilitado, que não sejam integrantes da rede credenciada para a realização dos procedimentos cobertos, ao qual pagará diretamente pelo serviço, solicitando posteriormente o reembolso, sendo que o ressarcimento dos valores obedecerá ao limite do plano contratado. O beneficiário titular declara que as informações constantes no pedido de reembolso são verdadeiras, estando ciente de que a não autenticidade dos documentos ou a omissão de qualquer informação, na tentativa de obter vantagem indevida, constitui fraude contra a Operadora, sujeito a perda do direito ao reembolso, cancelamento do plano de saúde e implicações judiciais, além de que o fato será imediatamente comunicado ao empregador (RH) e/ou representante legal da Pessoa Jurídica contratante do plano de saúde. As principais irregularidades não admitidas são: desdobramento de recibos; recibos de atendimento de pessoas diversas (não beneficiários do plano); recibos de atendimento de terceiros (ainda que conste o beneficiário como pagador); recibos falsos, adul- terados ou rasurados. Lembramos ainda que este rol não é taxativo, mas sim exemplificativo. A Operadora reserva-se no direito de contatar o prestador de serviços, emitente do recibo, sempre que julgar necessário, para comprovar e atestar a veracidade das informações. Para receber o reembolso é obrigatória a apresentação deste formulário devidamente preenchido, assim como a documentação exigida (check-list no verso) para cada tipo de serviço. A análise da solicitação e o reembolso serão efetuados no prazo de 30 dias a partir da data do recebimento da docu- mentação na Life Empresarial Saúde.

Based on the size of the flue selected, a preliminary damper size must be assumed. At this point in the design process, it is only necessary to decide if the damper throat area to be used will be equal to or twice the flue area. Once this decision has been made the Inlet Loss Coefficient, K 2, may be determined. If the damper throat area is equal to the flue area, K 2 is equal to 2.5. If the damper throat is twice the flue area, K 2 is equal to 1.0.

In analyzing article citations, 1 was added to each citation count prior to log transformation as some articles received 0 citations during the observation period. While adding 1 shifts the citation distribution to the right, we were interested primarily in the slopes of the regression lines and not their intercepts. To interpret the results of the regression equation, estimates of log-transformed variables were exponentiated in order to arrive at their multiplicative effect (ME). For exam- ple, if the logCitation estimate were 0.5, the ME of this estimate would be e0.5 or 1.65, representing a 65% increase in citations.

These assignment guidelines pertain exclusively to Commercial Mobile Radio Service providers (CMRS). The IMSI Administrator directly administers only the Home Network Identity (HNI) segment of the resource. The HNI uniquely identifies the home wireless network of a FCC- licensed two-way CMRS subscriber and contains the Mobile Country Code (MCC) and the Mobile Network Code (MNC). The remaining segment of the IMSI, the Mobile Station Identification Number (MSIN), is directly administered by the wireless network licensee to which the HNI is assigned. Issue: In 1998, ITU Recommendation E.212 was modified allowing IMSI assignments to those Wireline Service Providers offering limited mobility services. As a result, HNI assignments are no longer available exclusively to CMRS providers. The current IMSI assignment and administrative guidelines do not however reflect these modifications.

on a subset of the press releases they read each day, either found on a press release aggregation website such as Eu- rekAlert! or Science Daily or sent to them by media offices. Discovering what sort of content journalists believe is sig- nificant and likely to be popular provides insight into how journalists judge the newsworthiness of different content, uncovering their biases and preferences, and helps shed light on high-profile issues being actively debated relating to the “science of science communication” (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2017). Scholars who have studied the decision-making of jour- nalists in terms of story selection and framing have exam- ined various factors, from institutional and economic incen- tives to a need for social validation (Donsbach 2004). In the realm of science, practices such as embargoing of scholarly findings and the attendant effects on communication have been examined, suggesting that certain science communica- tions and public relations strategies can influence news cov- erage (Kiernan 2003b). Research has suggested that jour- nalists seldom choose to report on scientific studies outside of the domains of health and medicine (Suleski and Ibaraki 2009). Issues of hype and errors of framing and omission have long plagued various forms of news media and science communication, with the cycle of hype sometimes begin- ning with researchers themselves using exaggerated terms such as “breakthrough” in press materials and public an- nouncements (Bubela et al. 2009). News reporting may then replicate the exaggerations found in such communi- cations materials (Sumner et al. 2014). Further, news sto- ries, particularly those produced by elite outlets, may influ- ence the prestige of, and citations to, scientific research, fu- eling a hype cycle that is increasingly coming under scrutiny in the research and media communities (Kiernan 2003a; Caulfield et al. 2016).

Table 3. Incidence numbers (column 2 = total, columns 3-7 = stages 0-IV, column 8 = stage unknown or “?”, for each row columns 3 through 8 add up to column 2), incidence rates in % for stages 0-IV and stage unknown (columns 9-13 = stages 0-IV, column 14 = stage unknown, for each row columns 9 through 14 add up to 100% up to rounding to 2 digits), and incidence rates for stages I-IV only with stage 0 and stage unknown specifically excluded (columns 15-18 = stages I-IV, for each row columns 15 through 18 add up to 100% up to rounding to 2 digits). The incidence numbers are based on the data for California adults aged 20 and older diagnosed with the cancers listed in column 1 during 2005-2009 as reported in [Morris et al, 2013]. Some cancer sites in column 1 are abbreviated as follows: Breast = female breast, Cervix = cervix uteri, Rectum = rectum and rectosigmoid junction, Kidney = kidney and renal pelvis, liver = liver and intrahepatic bile ducts, Lung = lung and bronchus, Melanoma = melanoma of the skin, Oral = oral cavity and pharynx, Bladder = urinary bladder, Uterine = uterine corpus. For Bladder, stage I includes stage 0 (stage I = stage 0/I).
Back pain A recent review article in The Spine Journal looked at multiple treatment options for the treatment of sciatica – back pain with a pinched nerve with symptoms radiating down one leg. They found that non-opioid medications provided some positive global effect on the treatment of this disorder, while the opioids did not. When looking at the symptom of pain, opioids appeared to have no significant effect. The non-opioid medications did appear to have a positive effect on the pain, but these results did not reach statistical significance. (Lewis et al., 2013)

The sides and lower portion of the back of the combustion chamber should be vertical. Above the vertical portion of the back, the brick should be sloped forward towards the fireplace opening to support the metal damper and the clay flue lining. For the maximum amount of reflected heat into the room, the sloped portion of the back should be plane rather than concave. If it is concave, more heat will be reflected back into the fire rather than into the room. Greater splay of the sides also increases the amount of heat reflected into the room.

However, value frameworks are far from industry standard. The primary users of the ICER framework have been payers, with the goal of informing coverage decision processes. Physicians have yet to adopt NCCN and ASCO in a systematic way. One optimistic take voiced by members of the Gant Consortium was that as outcomes-based risk sharing agreements between drug manufacturers and payers gain in popularity, value frameworks may establish guardrails for contract negotiations.

(cid:2) The panel recommends that clinicians offer multi- modal analgesia, or the use of a variety of analgesic medications and techniques combined with non- pharmacological interventions, for the treatment of postoperative pain in children and adults (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Multimodal analgesia, defined as the use of a variety of analgesic medication and techniques that target different mechanisms of action in the peripheral and/or central nervous system (which might also be combined with nonpharmacological interventions) might have ad- ditiveorsynergisticeffectsandmoreeffectivepainrelief compared with single-modality interventions. For example, clinicians might offer local anesthetic-based regional (peripheral and neuraxial) analgesic techniques in combination with systemic opioids and other analge- sics as part of a multimodal approach to perioperative pain. Because of the availability of effective nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies for postop- erative pain management, the panel suggests that clini- cians routinely incorporate around the clock nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies into multi- modal analgesia regimens. Systemic opioids might not be required in all patients. One study suggests that it shouldbeavoidedwhennotneeded,becauselimitedev- idence suggests that perioperative opioid therapy might be associated with increased likelihood of long-term opioid use, with its attendant risks.4

DEFINIÇÃO: a Angiografia Diagnóstica consiste na injeção de meio de contraste intravascular, para que juntamente com uso das imagens radiológicas possa esclarecer de forma precisa os diagnósticos em questão. Este exame é considerado extremamente complexos. É necessário lembrar que o paciente deve ser encaminhado ao exame o mais bem preparado possível, no tocante das melhores condições de controle das doenças associadas, por exemplo Diabetes, hipertensão arterial, insuficiência cardíaca congestiva. Importante também não interromper medicação em uso conforme orientação especifica do médico assistente/ examinador. Reiterando trata – se de procedimento diagnóstico e logicamente não atende a prerrogativa de cura pois não se refere a procedimento terapêuticos e em algumas circunstâncias o médico assistente é obrigado a tomar decisões e providências conforme a necessidade do momento para se atingir a solução de problemas e desta forma atender com maior benefício para o paciente. Como todo exame que se caracteriza como “invasivo’’ este procedimento é acompanhado de uma estatística de efeitos indesejados/ complicações, que ocorre numa minoria extrema dos casos, mas devem ser explicitados. Dentre as possibilidades citamos:

Wind energy is the fastest growing energy source worldwide at about 20 to 30% per year. The worldwide installed capacity of onshore grid-connected wind power is about 40 GW. Turbine sizes have increased over the past two decades. In the mid-1980s, the rotor (blades and hub) diameter was about 20 m; today, rotor diameters are 100 m or more (bigger than the wingspan of a 747 aircraft), with the rotating blades covering an area the size of a football field.

Wood floor joists normally have a 3 in. (75 mm) fire cut end and bear only on the interior wythe of a cavity wall. The ends of the joist must not project into the cavity; they can form a ledge, which may create a moisture bridge across the cavity. Wood floor joists may also be fastened to metal joist hangers attached to a ledger bolted to the inner wythe of the cavity wall, or joist hangers may be embedded in the inner wythe of the cavity wall. See Fig. 23.

Recent analyses of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)- Medicare database tracked healthcare use and costs (projected to 2004 levels) from diagnosis and initial treatment [ 15 ] , in addition to a 4-year follow-up [ 17 ] , for a cohort of 81 659 elderly patients with prostate cancer who had Medicare claims from 1991 to 2003 [ 15 ] , and 1991 to 2004 [ 17 ] , respectively. Treatment in the fi rst year after diagnosis was calculated to incur costs of $21 040 per patient; $13 091 for prostate cancer-related costs and $7949 for medical costs unrelated to prostate cancer [ 15 ] . In terms of cost at each stage, as expected, there was an increase in costs from stage I to IV [ 15,17 ] . Prostate cancer-related costs over 4 years from diagnosis averaged $18 168 per patient [ 17 ] . The annual healthcare cost burden estimated in 2009 is > $2.5 billion annually for initial care alone [ 17 ] .

Canada has a national stopgap to protect consumers from price gouging. The Patient Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB), a consumer protection agency, has the authority to impose sanctions and price reductions for patented products deemed excessively priced. However, the PMPRB is hobbled in its ability to keep Canada’s drug spending low.

of the introductions contain a single move: BESP1 only contains Move 1 whereas BESP3 and BESP8 only contain Move 3. None of them follow a strict M1–M2–M3 sequence. The only sequence that is repeated is M1–M3, which occurs four times. In summary, RAIs in The ESPecialist do not seem to follow a pattern in the organization of their rhetorical moves although there seems to be a preference for the M1–M3 type. In this type of structural organization, the authors establish a territory (by making topic generalizations and giving background information, for example) and then present their current study (by announcing the present research and indicating the structure of the article, for example). The ESPj RAIs, on the other hand, follow the pattern proposed by the CARS model more closely. Three of them follow the M1–M2–M3 sequence strictly while five others (i.e., ESPj3, ESPj5, ESPj7, ESPj8 and ESPj9) contain this sequence plus a repetition of one or more moves. Among these, ESPj5, ESPj7 and ESPj8 show very little variation from the canonical sequence: ESPj5 contains a one-sentence Move 1 between a 7-sentence Move 2 and a 7-sentence Move 3 while ESPj7 and ESPj8 each contain two instances of Move 2, establishing the niche in two separate installments. With the exception of ESPj2, all the RAIs in this corpus contain a Move 2, and there was only one instance (i.e., ESPj1) of Move 3-fronting. ESPj1 did not contain a Move 1 either, being, overall, the introduction that was the most dissimilar from the model.

ultraviolet light must be evaluated in flashing selection. Flashing material should not be susceptible to corrosion in fresh mortar or react with adjacent materials such as rigid insulation. Flashing should be easily formed into the desired shape. Compatibility with materials such as sealants or adhesives should be reviewed. Expected life of the flashing materials should be the expected life of the structure, at a minimum. All of these qualities of the flashing material must be taken into consideration in selection because replacement is expensive. Table 2 describes the thickness and advantages and disadvantages of flashing materials that can be installed in brick masonry cavity walls.

Results from the tests showed that the average value of critical thinking ability to the average achievement after the testing ended, showed the relationship was statistically significant (.05). As a result, the researchers compared the results of Table 4 and determined that after the posttest, data showed the average of critical thinking ability and post-learning achievement were higher than before the study.

What is the purpose of a RA and what makes it a good one, and who decides that it is a good RA? Are there rules for easier writing? If the main function of a RA is to transfer a new knowledge on a research topic, then a good paper is the one that is clear, coherent, focused, well argued and uses language that does not have ambiguous or equivoque meaning. However, it is not only the message that is important. The RA must have a well-defined structure and function in serve like a cook-book, so the others can reproduce and repeat explained experiments. Answer research questions Give summary conclusions There are some rules that can make the writing and publishing of RAs 'easier'. Here, we summarised some 'golden' rules that should always be in the mind of an inexperienced researcher (Table 3). We put all these together to make a final list of some 40 logical steps, which can be find in the Appendix.

At checkpoint 6, before starting treat- ment, each chemotherapy medication should be checked in- dependently against the prescriber’s orders by at least two individuals who are trained and competent to administer chemotherapy medications. All dosage- and administration- rate-related calculations should be independently verified. This includes any infusion pump rate settings, which should be checked at the initiation of each container of the infu- sion, periodically throughout the infusion, and whenever a new nurse assumes care for the patient. Healthcare providers should routinely confirm that the medication will be admin- istered to the intended patient by comparing a patient’s name and unique identifying code or number with medication la- bels (e.g., alpha–numeric characters or bar codes) and that a drug product’s identity, ancillary components (e.g., addi-

Sleep-inducing drugs (hypnotics) are medications specif- ically designed to induce sleepiness directly after intake. Optimal agents affect cognitive performance during this period while inducing minimal sleepiness in the waking day after use. An optimal hypnotic would have low tox- icity and addictive potential, as well a minimal side effect profile (Oswald 1970). Among the first hypnotics, and an agent still in use is chloral hydrate - the original “Mickey Finn” - slipped into the drinks of unsuspecting marks for the purposes of criminal activity. Unfortu- nately, this medication is difficult to use since the LD-50 (potentially fatal dose) is quite close to the therapeutic dose. In the years leading up to the 1970’s, rapidly acting barbiturates were commonly utilized for their hypnotic effects. Unfortunately, these medications, also drugs of abuse, had a significant danger of overdose and contrib- uted to an era that was characterized in part by deaths due to overdoses of sleeping pills. These medications and similar barbiturate-like medications [Methaqualone (Quaalude, Sopor) Glutethimide (Doriden), Ethchlor- vynol (Placidyl), Methyprylon (Nodudar)] have limited availability and are rarely used due to limited efficacy, cognitive effects, the potential for abuse and lethal tox- icity associated with overdose (Oswald 1970). Today their primary therapeutic uses include executions and fa- cilitated euthanasia (Lossignol 2008). Most currently utilized hypnotics affect the widely dis- persed negative neurotransmitter GABA. In the 1970’s benzodiazepines (GABA agonists) were first marketed as hypnotics. Some of these agents had an extremely short duration of action [Triazolam (Halcion)]. While this agent-induced minimal next day somnolence, use was as- sociated with daytime memory impairment, particularly at higher dosages (Roehrs et al. 2000; Adam and Oswald

and health-maintenance. Health is the natural state of the body, and the body possesses complex, homeo- static, self-regulatory mechanisms that it uses to heal itself from injury. In times of disease, when a part of the body is functioning sub-optimally, other parts of the body come out of their natural state of health in order to compensate for the dysfunction. During this compensatory process, however, new dysfunctions may arise. Osteopathic physicians must work to adjust the body so as to realign its parts back to normal. Osteopathic manipulative medicine aims to restore the body’s self-healing capacity by decreasing allo- static load, or the physiologic effects of chronic bodily stresses,1 and enhancing the immune system.

President Obama has recently expressed a strong conviction that “Science offers great potential for improving health”. The President has announced a research initiative that aims to accelerate progress toward a new era of precision medicine. The time is accurate for this idealistic initiative, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other partners will work to attain this vision [7]. The concept of precision medicine speaks of prevention and treatment strategies that take individual variability into account. Even though it is not new, the impact of practicality is still deprived. If one considers blood typing, for instance, has been used to guide blood transfusions for more than a century. But the vision of applying this concept broadly has been intensely improved by the latest development of large-scale biologic databases (such as the human genome sequence), powerful methods for typifying patients (such as proteomics, metabolomics, genomics, diverse cellular assays, and even mobile health technology), and computational tools for analyzing large sets of data. Francis S.Collins et al. stated that, “What is necessary now is a broad
Table 1 shows the results of our approach using the CUI and ST de(cid:2)nitions as context for the possi- ble concepts on the NLM-WSD dataset and Table 4 shows similar results using the con(cid:3)ate dataset. On the NLM-WSD dataset, the results show a large difference in accuracy between the contexts on a word by word basis making it dif(cid:2)cult to deter- mine which of the context description performs the best. The unigram results show that CUI→ST and CUI+ST obtain the highest accuracy for (cid:2)ve words, and CUI and ST obtain the highest accuracy for one word. The bigram results show that CUI→ST and CUI obtains the highest accuracy for two words, ST obtains the highest accuracy for four words, and CUI+ST obtains the highest accuracy for one word. The overall results show that using unigrams with

There are many various design procedures for cavity walls. Both rational and empirical design methods are used. Rational design methods currently use working stress analysis. Limit states or strength design methods are now being written. Other methods such as a modified yield line approach, fracture line approach and elastic performance of cracked panels have been proposed for the design of unreinforced walls. However, insufficient data and lack of recognition by model building codes relegate these methods to use as special systems for design.

Cast refractory and formed clay throats are available, built to certain angles and dimensions to fit most conventional fireplace dimensions. These elements are positioned on top of the firebox walls and eliminate the need of constructing brick courses to form the throat. Once in place, brick masonry can be built around the throat to give the appearance of conventionally built throats in the breastwork of the fireplace.

We have also built various SVR models using different feature combinations fro strength analysis. The average accuracy from 10-fold cross validation is shown in Table 11. Note that all the results are generated using a linear kernel based SVR. From Table 11 we observe that all the feature combinations deliver approximately similar high-quality results. In other words, the addition of bigrams and semantics-based structural features does not improve the overall performance. This indicates that using unigrams alone is sufficient for the strength prediction task. The main reason behind this phenomenon is that unlike polarity of a relationship, the strength of a relationship is often directly associated with the specific words used in the relationship- depicting phrase. For instance, the sentence “Soy consumption significantly reduces the risk of cancer.” has a strong strength. The word “significantly” carries the most weight for the SVR model to make the correct prediction. This also explains why the addition of other semantics based features does not help in general. Another observation we have made is that the linear kernel constantly outperforms the other kernels. Finally, we notice that the medium strength achieves the highest accuracy as against

We use the learning-to-rank algorithm, lambdaMART (Burges 2010). LambdaMART directly optimizes ranking quality measures such as Normalized Discounted Cumu- lative Gain (NDCG) and Mean Average Precision (MAP) using gradient boosted decision trees. We use Microsoft’s LightGBM to train the model, training it to optimize NDCG. For the daily problem, we optimize and evaluate on NDCG@10 since it is a usual search engine metric and we found 10 to be the upper limit on the number of scientific ar- ticles a real news outlet would cover in a day. For the weekly problem, we optimize and evaluate on a range of ranks 7, 35, and 70, corresponding to outlets which publish on 1, 5, or 10 scientific articles each day. We use DART (Dropouts meet Multiple Additive Regression Trees) as the boosting type, as previous research has shown that DART overcomes MART’s issue of over-specialization to a considerable ex- tent and improves performance on ranking tasks (Rashmi and Gilad-Bachrach 2015).

Estou ciente que: A cirurgia do trauma ocular caracteriza-se por ser uma cirurgia de urgência visando recuperar a melhor função visual possível com a melhora estética. A anestesia costuma ser geral realizada por anestesiologista especialista. Em alguns casos o médico pode optar pela local que também será assistida por um médico anestesiologista. Trata-se de uma cirurgia onde o médico oftalmologista não pode prever os resultados e esta pode ser a primeira de outras cirurgias que poderão ser necessárias. É uma cirurgia com índices altos de complicações se comparada com as cirurgias eletivas. Podem ocorrer:

Concrete masonry units are usually used for the interior wythe of a cavity wall in combination with a brick masonry exterior. They may also be used as accent bands in the exterior brick wythe. Hollow or solid concrete masonry units should conform to ASTM C 55 Specification for Concrete Building Brick, ASTM C 90 Specification for Loadbearing Concrete Masonry Units or ASTM C 129 Specification for Non-Loadbearing Concrete Masonry Units. Non load- bearing concrete masonry units are usually specified for the interior wythe when the brick and block cavity wall is used as infill walls for concrete or steel frame structural systems if shear loads are not transmitted to that wythe.

and end-of-life issues, because diagnoses such as breast cancer are associated with increased CAM use in conjunction with con- ventional treatment (Deng et al., 2004; Mao et al., 2008). Nurses need to possess a good understanding of the survivor’s motiva- tion surrounding the use of CAM. Addressing unmet needs, side-effect management, and conducting an evaluation of the patient’s understanding of safety in these therapies is imperative in future survivor care. Because CAM use is more likely related to symptom treatment, such as pain, fatigue, and hot flashes (Mao et al., 2008), a thorough focus on side-effect management also is an essential component of survivorship.

Table 6—Common Comorbid Psychiatric Disorders and Symptoms II. Pre-Sleep Conditions: Patients with insomnia may de- velop behaviors that have the unintended consequence of per- petuating their sleep problem. These behaviors may begin as strategies to combat the sleep problem, such as spending more time in bed in an effort to “catch up” on sleep. Other behaviors in bed or in the bedroom that are incompatible with sleep may include talking on the telephone, watching television, computer use, exercising, eating, smoking, or “clock watching.” Insom- nia patients may report sensations of being more aware of the environment than are other individuals and may report antici- pating a poor sleep hours before bedtime, and become more alert and anxious as bedtime approaches. Characterization of the sleeping environment (couch/bed, light/dark, quiet/noisy, room temperature, alone/bed partner, TV on/off) as well as the patient’s state of mind (sleepy vs. wide awake, relaxed vs. anx- ious) is helpful in understanding which factors might facilitate or prolong sleep onset or awakenings after sleep. III. Sleep-Wake Schedule: In evaluating sleep-related symptoms, the clinician must consider not only the patient’s “usual” symptoms, but also their range, day-to-day variability, and evolution over time. Specific sleep-wake variables such as

Oklahoma State Law and the federal No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) require that we identify whether students in our school district are English Language Learners (ELL). Both of these laws require a language instruction educational program for ELL students with limited English proficiency (LEP). The identification process and placement of your child in a language instruction educational program is based on a combination of the home language questionnaire, teacher judgment, English test results and other measures. Your child’s English proficiency test scores are shown below.
Treatment for cancers of the colon and rectum varies by tumor location, characteristics, and stage. Surgical procedures for colorectal cancer include local tumor excision or destruction, colectomy (removal of all or part of the colon), proctectomy (removal of the rectum), and proctocolectomy (removal of the rectum and all or part of the colon). The majority of early stage (I and II) colon cancers are treated with colectomy alone (84%), while most patients with stage III disease receive chemotherapy in addition to surgery (67%) (Figure 6, page 11).

Some countries may place limits on the frequency and magnitude of price increments, or even impose a price freeze or price reduction (161,184). In the latter, pharmaceutical prices cannot be raised for a predetermined period of time unless there is a justification. For example, since August 2010 (and at least until 2022), Germany has implemented a moratorium to halt price increase for medicines that are not subject to reference pricing, except for inflation (185).

In particular, there is no universally accepted view on what dimensions of value should be considered for the purpose of determining medicine prices. Fig. 3.8 (p.34) shows the various dimensions of value noted in the literature and government guidelines, summarized into eight themes. Common dimensions considered in health technology assessments are: clinical and public health needs for the proposed medicine, clinical evidence, economic and financial public health considerations. More debatable is whether to include as innovativeness of the medicine, and the need to incentivize future

Building on Failures Researchers continue on their search for effective new treatments for the more than 120 forms of brain cancer, but they face great challenges.93 Since 1998, there have only been 3 new drug approvals for brain cancer, while another 75 medicines have failed in the development process having been discontinued, suspended, or had no development reported.94 That is a 25:1 ratio of unsuccessful attempts to FDA-approved medicines. Decades of research have provided limited treatment options for patients facing aggressive, late-stage forms of brain cancer. Although challenges persist, researchers continue to use past setbacks to inform future discoveries in brain cancer therapies.

For rectal cancer, 61% of stage I patients have a proctectomy or proctocolectomy, about half of whom also receive radiation and/ or chemotherapy (Figure 7). In contrast to colon cancer, stage II and III rectal cancers are often treated with chemotherapy com- bined with radiation before surgery (neoadjuvant). Chemotherapy is the main treatment for metastatic rectal cancer, although in some cases surgery is possible. A number of targeted drugs are also available to treat metastatic disease.

• Mood disturbances and cognitive difficulties. Complaints of irritability, loss of interest, mild depression and anxi- ety are common among insomnia patients. Patients with chronic insomnia often complain of mental inefficiency, difficulty remembering, difficulty focusing attention, and difficulty with complex mental tasks. • Quality of life: The irritability and fatigue associated with insomnia may cause interpersonal difficulties for insomnia patients, or avoidance of such activities. Conversely, in- terpersonal difficulties may be an important contributor to insomnia problems for some individuals. Sleep and wak- ing problems may lead to restriction of daytime activities, including social events, exercise, or work. Lack of regular daytime activities and exercise may in turn contribute to insomnia. • Exacerbation of comorbid conditions. Comorbid condi- tions may cause or increase sleep difficulties. Likewise, poor sleep may exacerbate symptomatology of comorbid conditions. Sleep complaints may herald the onset of mood disorders or exacerbation of comorbid conditions. VI. Other History: A complete insomnia history also in- cludes medical, psychiatric, medication/substance, and family/ social/occupational histories. A wide range of medical (Table 5) and psychiatric (Table 6) conditions can be comorbid with
Total 5-year costs, including costs of both diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer, is reported in a second study by Fourcade et al . (Benedict A, Fourcade RO, Black LK, Stokes ME, Alcaraz A, Castro RS. Long term costs of prostate cancer: estimates for France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK. In preparation. 2011 ). These values were € 269 million (UK), € 618 million (France), € 486 million (Germany), € 364 million (Italy) and € 198 million (Spain). A UK study estimated that total costs for men diagnosed with prostate cancer in the 2001 – 2002 BAUS data with 5-year follow-up, were £ 92.74 million, with an average cost per patient of £ 7294 over 5 years [ 16 ] , higher than Fourcade ’ s UK estimates, which ranged between € 7040 and € 8580 ( £ 5547 – £ 6761) depending on cancer stage. Discrepancies between the two studies may arise through differences in the estimations of individual treatment costs, the proportions of patients receiving each type of therapy, or a combination of both.

return-to-sport progression is individualised and is a function of the injury, the athlete’s age, prior SRC and level of play, and the ability to provide close supervision during the return to activity. The return-to-sport progression presented by the CISG is widely accepted but empiric, without evidence to support either the progression sequence or the time spent in each stage. In general, for young athletes, each stage of the progression should be at least 24 hours without return of symptoms before progressing to the next stage. (C)

We report the results for four experiments in this pa- per: i) the results of using the IDF stoplist over a ba- sic stoplist, ii) the results of our approach using dif- ferent context descriptions of the possible concepts of a target word, iii) the results of our approach com- pared to SenseClusters and Humphrey et al. (2006) using the NLM-WSD dataset, and iv) the results of our approach compared to SenseClusters using the con(cid:3)ated dataset. The results of using an individualized IDF stoplist for each target word show an improvement over us- ing the basic stoplist. The results of our approach using different context descriptions show that for the NLM-WSD dataset the large differences in accuracy makes it unclear which of the context descriptions performed the best. On the con(cid:3)ated dataset, adding the ST de(cid:2)nition to the context description improved

Background: In 1995, the US wireless telecommunications industry developed assignment guidelines for International Mobile Station Identifier (IMSI) in the US. These guidelines were developed in an open industry forum sponsored by the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA) and in accordance with ITU Recommendation E.212. The result of this development effort was the consensus-approved document titled IMSI Assignment Guidelines and Procedures Version 1.0.

Objectives of Phase 3. In Phase 3 the working group integrated the findings of the first 2 phases, refined the scoring system, and determined the optimal cut point to define “definite RA.” The goal of this final phase was to utilize the results of Phases 1 and 2 to develop a scoring system that would be applicable to newly presenting patients with undifferentiated inflam- matory arthritis to permit identification of those with a high probability of developing persistent and/or erosive RA. Being intended for use with newly presenting patients, the scoring system should be robust enough that it could be applied repeatedly during the early course of disease, such that a patient identified as not classifiable as having definite RA at initial presentation might be classified as having definite RA at a subsequent time point. The work was not aimed at classifying subjects with established disease, either active or inac- tive. However, the working group recognized that pa- tients may present for the first time with disease that is at a later stage and being treated. Thus, although it was not the explicit charge of the working group to provide

Early evidence suggests that value frameworks hold promise in providing reliable, consistent measures of quality. A recent study applied the NCCN, ASCO, and ICER frameworks to five advanced lung cancer drugs to assess the rankings across frameworks and the degree to which they provide consistent determinations of drug quality. The frameworks ranked each of the drugs similarly, with stronger agreement between ASCO and NCCN than ICER and NCCN. Inter-rater reliability for each drug was highest for ASCO, and lowest for ICER.36
