Single-wythe chimneys should be attached to the structure. This is generally accomplished by using corrosion- resistant metal ties spaced at a maximum of 24 in. (600 mm) on center. Multi-wythe chimneys that are not masonry bonded should be bonded together using metal wire ties.

Racking. Chimneys are generally not as wide as the body of the fireplace below. When racking back to achieve the desired dimensions or location of the chimney care must be exercised to insure that, since there is no limitation on the distance each unit may be racked, cores of the units are not exposed. Preferred construction consists of a setting bed over the racked face with uncored or paving brick set to provide a weather resistant surface. Mortar washes may also be used. They may not, however, be as durable. When using a mortar wash it should not bridge over the rack, but should fill each step individually. Both methods of racking are shown in Fig. 6.
