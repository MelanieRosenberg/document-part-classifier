To determine if there were possible changes in participants’ ratings before and after the workshop, paired t-tests were run and analyzed. Table 2 shows mean scores and standard deviations (SDs) from the Pre-Workshop Student Survey and the Post-Workshop Student Survey, mean score differences and standard errors (SEs), dependent-samples t-tests results (t statistic and degrees of freedom), p-values, and the effect sizes (measured by dependent-samples Cohen’s d).

Table 3 shows faculty participants’ self-perception of their previous experience in mentoring and as well as faculty participants’ perceptions of the workshop effectiveness. Before the workshop started, the faculty participants (n = 28) showed a medium average of previous experience in mentoring with a wide variability. Specifically, faculty participants (n = 28) yielded a mean of 3.68 (SD = 1.02) on “Do you have substantial previous experience in mentoring?” This showed some faculty do not have much previous mentoring experience while some others have substantial previous mentoring experience.

In addition, these faculty participants’ (n = 26, due to the exclusion of two incomplete post- workshop surveys from faculty) highly-rated perceptions of workshop effectiveness were reported here. Specifically, the majority expressed that the workshop was helpful (M = 4.77, SD = 0.51), that the workshop was organized well (M = 4.88, SD = 0.33), that they would attend future related

From   Table  2, student  participants  yielded  significantly higher  ratings from  the  post-workshop
survey  than  those from  the pre-workshop    survey  in obtaining  “more  knowledge   and  skills to be a
successful  scientist” with a large effect size (M diff = +0.83, SE = 0.98, t (df = 132) = 9.72, p < .001, d =
1.02); in being “able to use good  habits  and strategies to help  with scientific research” with  a large
effect size (M diff = +0.73, SE = 0.99, t (df = 132) = 8.47, p < .001, d = 0.83); in being “aware of mentorship
support/  resources/   services/ facilities etc.” with a small to medium   effect size (M diff = +0.39, SE =
0.88, t (df = 130) = 5.05, p < .001, d = 0.37); in their “overall confidence  in becoming    a successful
scientist” with a large  effect size (M diff = +1.07, SE = 0.98, t (df = 113) = 11.61, p < .001, d = 1.14); in
believing  that “mentoring   for undergraduate   students  is important   to their success” with  a small
effect size (M diff = +0.16, SE = 0.77, t (df = 132) = 2.37, p = .019, d = 0.22); and in their belief and interest
in becoming   a scientist with a medium   effect size (M diff = +0.50, SE = 1.19, t (df = 132) = 4.90, p < .001, d
