Results from the tests showed that the average value of critical thinking ability to the average achievement after the testing ended, showed the relationship was statistically significant (.05). As a result, the researchers compared the results of Table 4 and determined that after the posttest, data showed the average of critical thinking ability and post-learning achievement were higher than before the study.
