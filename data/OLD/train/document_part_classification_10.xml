In compliance with the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, the College is prohibited from providing certain information from your student records to a third party, such as information on grades, billing, financial aid (including scholarships, grants, work-study) and other student record information. This restriction applies, but is not limited, to your parents, your spouse, or a sponsor. You may, at your discretion, grant the College permission to release information about your student records to a third party by submitting a completed Student Consent to Release Education Records. You must complete a separate form for each third party to whom you grant access to information on your education records. The specific information will be made available only if requested by the authorized third party. The College does not automatically send information to a third party.

Submit your completed form to Registrar’s Office, at Cogswell College. Please note that your authorization to release information has no expiration date; however, you may revoke your authorization at any time by sending a written request to the same address. NOTE: For the third party designee your name on this form, this release overrides all FERPA directory suppression information that you have set up in your student record. However, it is the College policy not to release certain aspects of the student records (e.g., registration, grades, GPA) over the phone or via email.
