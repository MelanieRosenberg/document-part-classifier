While many of these symptoms can be seen with other conditions such as allergies, we ask that you seek medical evaluation if you identify any of these symptoms. Loss of taste or smell is very specific to COVID‐19 and may be described as food tasting bland, rather than not being able to taste. If your child develops any of these symptoms, please notify your child’s school, contact your child’s doctor for evaluation/testing, and keep your child home from school.
