A: Under the order, a business cannot require workers to leave their homes unless the workers are “necessary to sustain or protect life or to conduct minimum basic operations.” Workers considered necessary to sustain or protect life are those who meet the definition of “critical infrastructure workers” provided in sections 8 and 9 of the order. Only workers properly designated for these purposes can be on- site. All other in-person business operations must be suspended. In determining whether certain in-person operations are permitted under the order, businesses that offer goods and services must bear in mind that, under the order, individuals are only allowed to leave their homes to secure necessary services or supplies, such as food, medication, and products necessary to maintain the safety, sanitation, and basic operation of their residences. Businesses must tailor their in-person provision of goods and services accordingly.

The order does not prohibit or suspend work that can be performed remotely. All work under the order must be performed remotely to the greatest extent possible, and any in-person work must be done in accordance with the mitigation measures required under section 5 of the order.

In cooperation with the Mason County Prosecutor, we request that you take immediate action to ensure that your organization is only open to service critical infrastructure needs and no employees are on site to service non-critical infrastructure needs such as filing, answering phones, or other clerical duties. Any employees that are working on-site must maintain social distancing in compliance with the Governor’s Order. Failure to voluntarily comply with this request will result in these complaints being forwarded to local law enforcement agencies for enforcement action. We appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.

<UNSPECIFIED>
Despite this clear guidance, there have been  complaints  that you are requiring non-
critical infrastructure employees to come into work.  For example,  employees
required to file documents, draft letters and other operations that are not critical to
securing the safety or welfare of the people your organization services. Please take
immediate   action to comply with social distancing and only maintain  necessary  on-
site operations in compliance with  the Governor’s Executive  Order 2020-21.
