The undersigned hereby voluntarily consents to undergo a health screening test performed by Healthwaves. I understand that it is not possible to diagnose or define any disease or problem with a single test alone, and that a screening cannot detect every health problem. For example, a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test cannot detect all prostate cancers. I understand these tests are for screening purposes only and are not diagnostic tests or a substitute for a more complete examination by a physician. Blood test results can fluc- tuate from day to day due to changes in the individual and from laboratory variation. As a result, a test may be abnormal at one time and not another. If any of my results fall outside normal ranges, I understand I should see a physician for a follow up evaluation. Often a retest by your physician will be necessary. A new sterile needle is used for each blood test. I understand possible but infrequent side effects include fainting, bacterial infection, or bruising (hematoma) at the puncture site. In rare circumstances, I may be contacted for a redraw due to a poor lab sample. I understand that because these are screenIng tests, they are not reImbursable under most Insurance plans. Screening tests are being performed per the direction and authority of the Healthwaves Medical Director, Patrick N. Connell, M.D. or as otherwise designated on the laboratory requisition or results forms. Healthwaves practices in accordance with the HIPAA regulations as pertains to privacy practices and patient confidentiality regarding protected health information.
