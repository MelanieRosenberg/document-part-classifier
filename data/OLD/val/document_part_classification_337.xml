2.3 Concept Matcher Process
</TITLE>
<TEXT>
This step finds best matching concept from UMLS and assigns them to the domain phrase along with the match value. In order to find the conceptual match between the phrase and the possible concepts, the context map is used to find related phrases. These related phrases can map to a unique UMLS concept or many concepts. We look for related phrases with uniquely mapping concepts and then build a suffix tree for the concept hierarchy compute the conceptual distance [10] between the possible phrase concepts and the unique concept. The shortest distance between two concepts is computed by a spreading activation search on the UMLS hierarchy graph. Two concepts share a common concept in the graph. There may be several common concepts between two concepts (through various parents of these two concepts). The shortest path common concept links the closest matching concepts. This notion of conceptual similarity is based on the premise that “related terms in the context map are closely related to each other in the UMLS graph”.

2.3.2 Lexical Match
</TITLE>
<TEXT>
We may not find a semantic match between arbitrary concepts in UMLS. ‘It should be pointed out that UMLS defined a parent Concept Unique Identifiers (CUI) only for a minority of CUIs, usually mutuating the parents from the titles of classification sections (e.g."Bronchial-Diseases")’.[12] Other links such as ‘broader’ or ‘narrower’ in the Metathesaurus are not well defined as they reference related terms from different vocabularies and can contain cycles and other ambiguities.

2.4 Relationship Matcher Process
</SECTION_HEADER>
<TEXT>
A user might be interested in certain types of relationships. It is necessary to assign types to the retrieved verbs in relationship triples. We have created patterns for the 54 UMLS Semantic Network relationship links. We assign these categories to the extracted verbs. In order to increase the accuracy of this technique, we have built a system that uses WordNet resource for finding all word sense synonyms for the verb to match against our patterns list.
