is worth noting that these two long RAIs, as well as the longest introduction in the BESP subcorpus (i.e., BESP5, with 928 words), contained the whole literature review. The only other introduction that also exhausted the literature review was ESPj5. Besides a higher average number of words per RAI, the ESPj subcorpus also had a higher average number of sentences per RAI. The number of paragraphs, however, was smaller in this subcorpus than in the BESP subcorpus. In fact, three of the 10 ESPj introductions only had one paragraph, whereas BESP introductions required at least two. The ratio between the number of sentences and paragraphs shows that eight out of the 10 BESP introductions had fewer than three sentences per paragraph while, in the ESPj corpus, three was the minimum found and the average was 5.2.

Table 1
Details of the The ESPecialist RAIs.
Details of the English for Specific Purposes RAIs.
   All the BESP   authors  are affiliated with a Brazilian University, which  came  as no  surprise considering  that
Portuguese   is not an international language   and that researchers  whose  first language  is not Portuguese  have
the option  of submitting manuscripts   to The ESPecialist  in English, Spanish  and  French.  To have  a better idea
of the institutional affiliation of the authors who  publish in this journal, I have considered  the remaining  arti-
cles in the three issues from which the corpus  was  selected. Besides the 10 articles in Portuguese, there were five
articles in English. There  were  no articles in Spanish  or French.  The  authors  of  these five articles are: three
from  Brazil, one  from  Spain   and  one from   Argentina,  confirming   the predominance    of Brazilian  authors.
The  authorship  of  the ESPj  articles, as seen in Table 2, is quite varied, reflecting the international  status of
the journal.
   The  findings from  the analysis using  the CARS    model  are shown   in Table 3 below.  The  move   structure of
the BESP   RAIs   show  significant deviation  from  the structure proposed   by  the CARS    model.  To  start with,
seven  out of the 10  BESP   introductions  do  not contain  a move   2 (i.e., they do not establish a niche). Three
