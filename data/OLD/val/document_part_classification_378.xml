data               or ranges are missing, but      for consistency  in the analyses (Appendix
                   group descriptions are given    4)
                   Standard error missing          The  p value (either exact or the upper
                                                   bound)  is used to estimate the standard
                                                   error
Quantile-based     Numbers   of controls (or the   Group  sizes are assumed  to be

                   Odds  ratio is missing          Unadjusted   odds ratios are calculated by
                                                   using numbers   of cases and controls in

                   missing                         interval were calculated from  raw
                                                   numbers   (although doing  so may  result in
                                                   a somewhat   smaller standard  error than
                                                   would  be obtained  in an adjusted
                                                   analysis)
                   Group  mean  or median  are     The  mid-point  of closed-ended
                   missing                         categories will be assigned  as
                                                   exposure  to the group.  The median
                                                   exposure  for open ended-categories
                                                   will be estimated by  using the
                                                   method   of Chene  and Thompson11
                                                   assuming   a normal or lognormal
                                                   distribution. However,  if the
                                                   number   of groups is too small to
                                                   calculate a distribution, the
                                                   midpoint  will be assigned to the
                                                   lowest  category. The upper  bound
                                                   plus the mid-range  of the precedent
                                                   category  will be assigned to the
                                                   highest category.

                   in cohort studies) is missing   reported odds  ratio (proportions will
                                                   be correct unless adjustment  for
