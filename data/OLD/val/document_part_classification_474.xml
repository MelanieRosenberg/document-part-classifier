INSULATION MATERIALS

<TEXT>
In cavity wall construction, the prescribed air space acts as an insulating layer in addition to the masonry units. Thermal performance of the system can be further enhanced by placing insulation materials in the cavity. Insulation materials used in brick masonry cavity walls include inorganic cellular materials such as perlite and vermiculite, and organic cellular materials such as polystyrene, polyurethane, polyisocyanurate and foams. These insulation types are manufactured in the form of rigid boards, granular fills and foams. Each of these types, if properly used, will result in a more thermally efficient wall system. Although the most important characteristic for insulation is its thermal resistance, other properties should be considered including water absorption, combustibility, density, insect resistance and ease of installation. The following criteria can be used for the selection of insulation materials for brick masonry cavity walls:

2.Thermal insulating efficiency must not be impaired nor degrade over time due to retained moisture from any source, i.e., wind-driven rain or vapor condensation. 3.Insulating materials must be long lasting, resisting rot due to moisture or dryness, offering no food value to vermin and meeting the building code requirements for flame resistance. 4.Granular fill materials must be capable of supporting their own weight without settlement to assure that no portion of the wall is without insulation and allow moisture to drain from the cavity. 5.Foam insulation materials must not shrink with age to assure that no portion of the wall is without insulation and that moisture does not have a path to migrate to the interior wythe. 6.Rigid boards must be firmly attached to the backing so as not to become dislodged in the cavity and allow air or water movement around the insulation.

Properties of insulation materials vary widely. Table 3 shows various properties of insulation materials used in brick masonry cavity walls. The thermal conductivity (k) and thermal resistance (R) provide a means of comparing the insulating properties of insulation materials. These are determined in accordance with ASTM C 177 Test Method for Steady-State Heat Flux Measurements and Thermal Transmission Properties by Means of the Guarded-Hot-Plate Apparatus measured at various temperatures. Due to the large number of types of insulation, and even larger number of manufacturers, Table 3 lists only a few representative values of physical properties. For some materials, an aged or stabilized value is given. In all cases, the aged or stabilized value is the one that should be used in design. Individual manufacturers should be consulted for design values and other properties of their specific materials and their applications.
