<TEXT>
The Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid is requesting that you verify the last day of attendance or engagement for the student referenced below. According to the Office of Registration & Records, the student has dropped the course after census and is receiving a “W” grade for the course.

<TEXT>
Federal regulations require that certain students who do not successfully complete a course (by receiving grades of F, U, W, IN, NR, or LA) be required to prove they began attendance. Those students must document that they began attendance in their course or be at risk of having to repay unearned funds.

Please indicate the last date of attendance/engagement in your course. If you do not have attendance records, please provide the last day of participation based on the student’s engagement in your course (turning in homework, taking a quiz, etc.) If you taught your course via distance education, please provide the last date where you can best determine the student’s engagement or participation in the course subject matter. Log in dates are not sufficient documentation of participation. Your immediate attention to this request will be greatly appreciated. If necessary, the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid will contact you to verify the accuracy of this document. Faculty/instructors with questions may contact Jamie Pendergrass (jfpender@ncsu.edu) with questions or concerns.
