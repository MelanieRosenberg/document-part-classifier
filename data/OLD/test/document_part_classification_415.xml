Out-of-Network Utilization and Cost Sharing
</SECTION_HEADER>
<TEXT>
OOP costs in the year of diagnosis came mostly from professional and non-inpatient facility services. Figure 8 shows the level of OOP costs by percentile for all study cancers combined. In general, patient cost-sharing is higher for out-of-network services than in-network. Not surprisingly, cancer patients in the highest decile of OOP spending also incurred the highest portion of OOP costs for out- of-network providers; conversely, patients in the lowest decile incurred the lowest portion of OOP costs for out-of-network providers.

A patient’s decision to use an OON provider selection may be intentional or accidental. Reasons patients may incur OON costs include patient preference for a particular provider or specialty care center that may be out of network, the lack of network providers with appropriate specialists, and the lack of awareness or transparency about which providers are in the patient’s plan network. Common scenarios for accidental use of OON providers are emergency care or care from an OON provider working at an in-network hospital (e.g., radiologist, assistant surgeon, anesthesiologist).22 23 Figure 9 suggests that there might be significant financial consequences to the patient going out of network, which could be exacerbated if health plans remove popular cancer providers from their networks. Figure 9 also provides information on the relationship between the OON percentage (right vertical axis--relative to total spending) and total patient cost-sharing (left vertical axis). While most patients in our study reported under 10% of all OOP cost in the year of diagnosis is spent on out-of- network providers, those in the highest percentile of OOP spending incurred as much as 40% of those costs out-of-network.
