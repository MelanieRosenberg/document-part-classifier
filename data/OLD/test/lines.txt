1 Reports of resistance to a given agent occurring in an area does not necessarily mean that occurrence is frequent enough to pose a significant public health risk. Bold “Y” indicates agents to which significant resistance occurs in a given area (although actual risk may be highly focal, e.g. South-East Asia, where MQ resistance, while very frequent in some limited areas, is infrequent or absent in most others). Regular “Y” indicates that, while resistance to agent has been reported, it is not believed to occur frequently enough to pose a significant public health risk.

Propranolol is routinely delivered orally. Propranolol in Inderal® is available in oral doses ranging from 10 to 80 mg per dose for the treatment of hypertension. Multiple doses per day may be permitted. This drug can also be absorbed mucosally, as demonstrated by sublingual delivery [12], and its bioavailability is higher when absorbed by this route rather than orally [13,14]. Propranolol has been delivered sublingually at 10 and 40 mg per dose [12,13], although this can produce mouth paresthesia, an undesirable effect. Also, propranolol has been delivered by rectal administration in mammals [15]. It does not demonstrate chemical dependence or sedation that are common side effects of many psychiatric medications. Propranolol is prescribed for the treatment of various cardiovascular indications with FDA approval, most notably hypertension, arrhythmia, angina, as well as prophylaxis of migraines. However, there is evidence that it can have some benefit with regard to a subset of the symptoms of panic and anxiety disorders. The drug’s anxiolytic potential was recognized as early as 1966, “Emotions are expressed through the autonomic nervous system, and anxiety states are associated with increased secretion of catecholamines. Propranolol may therefore have a place in the treatment of anxiety, especially when the symptoms are related to the cardiovascular system [16].” This prescient comment five decades ago was subsequently validated by clinical studies with regard to both aspects: (a) propranolol and other beta blockers have been used “off label” in the USA for the near-term prophylaxis of performance anxiety; and (b) the pharmacologic benefits of propranolol and other beta blockers are restricted to the cardiovascular system’s effects per se. The evidence is provided below. The beneficial anxiolytic effects are limited to blocking the pharmacologic effects of catecholamines upon the cardiovascular system without addressing the psychic (CNS) symptoms or other somatic symptoms of acute anxiety and panic, with the possible exception of tremors. (Table 1) summarizes the relevant evidence from clinical investigations in the literature regarding beta blockers used to treat anxiety conditions. Daily oral propranolol has been demonstrated in one prophylactic study to suppress panic attacks in subjects diagnosed with panic disorder and agoraphobia [17]. Tyrer and Lader demonstrated some effectiveness of oral propranolol in treating somatic anxiety symptoms, but not psychic (mental) anxiety [18,19]. Another daily oral prophylactic study compared propranolol (3 x 80 mg/day) to oxprenolol (3 x 80 mg/day) and revealed that both beta blockers reduced symptoms of anxiety at one or two weeks duration [20]. Both treatments reduced heart rate; propranolol by ~ 21 - 32 bpm and oxprenolol by ~ 16 - 23 bpm. However, propranolol was more effective at reducing palpitations when assessed on day 7 compared to oxprenolol. Another study demonstrated that

prostate cancer primarily affects older men in whom the disease has less impact on indirect costs, such as productivity loss. While it is also important to consider end-of-life costs associated with prostate cancer, there are limited end-of-life cost data in the literature (e.g. the costs of palliative care, nursing homes, etc.). Furthermore, investigating the impact of the physical and mental suffering both patients and relatives endure during prostate cancer

SINCE 2001, ALL state licensing boards have accepted the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensure Exam- ination of the United States (COMLEX-USA), which is produced by the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners (NBOME). The United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE), produced by the National Board of Med- ical Examiners (NMBE), is the licensing exam that all allo- pathic medical students are required to take. Both are comprised of three tests, called “steps” by the USMLE and “levels” by the COMLEX, which must be passed for a phy- sician to gain unlimited licensure to practice medicine in the United States. According to 2013 USMLE Performance Data pub- lished in the 2013 NBME Annual Report, 97 percent of MD students (N=19,108), 94 percent of DO students (N=2,680), and 79 percent of foreign medical students and gradu- ates (N=14,649) passed the USMLE Step 1 exam on their first attempt. The pass rates for the USMLE Step 2 exam (from 2012-2013) showed narrowing between the groups: 98 percent (N=18,658), 96 percent (N=1,615), and 84 per- cent (N=12,203), respectively.22 The reason only a minority of DO students elect to take the USMLE is because it is optional and not required for their licensure. Osteopathic medical students may elect to take the USMLE based on a variety of reasons, including the desire to pursue an allopathic residency program. Osteopathic medical students are unique in that they have the option to apply for osteopathic (AOA) residency programs, allo- pathic (ACGME) residency programs, dual-accredited pro- grams, or both AOA and ACGME programs. However, all osteopathic students are required to take the COMLEX, regardless of whether or not they elect to take the USMLE. Thus, those who do take the USMLE must take both exams, which slightly differ in their length, emphasis, and ques- tion type, although they cover similar material apart from OMM.

Brick masonry exhibits superior thermal mass, that is, the ability to store and slowly release heat at a later time. These properties help shift the peak heating or cooling loads to off-peak times and reduce the peak temperatures. Current energy codes take thermal mass into account by requiring a lower R-value for mass walls, such as brick cavity walls (see Technical Notes 4B).

A second (or multiple) primary cancer is a new cancer that is biologically distinct from the original cancer. Whether a cancer is a new primary or a recurrence is important because it deter- mines prognosis and treatment. The risk of developing a second primary cancer varies by the type of cancer first diagnosed (referred to as the first primary), treatment received, age at diag- nosis, and other factors.

4. Protect adjacent materials and nearby plants. Mask or otherwise protect windows, doors, and materials such as sealants, metal, glass, wood, limestone, cast stone, concrete masonry and ornamental trim from cleaning solutions. Cleaning chemicals may also damage plants and grass. It may be necessary to pre- vent the cleaning solution and run-off from contacting plants or the surrounding soil. 5. Saturate the area to be cleaned. Flush with water from the top down. Saturated brick masonry will not absorb the cleaning solution or dissolved mortar particles. Areas below the area being cleaned should also be saturated and kept wet until after the final rinse to prevent streaking and absorption of the run-off from above.

Wind energy is the fastest growing energy source worldwide at about 20 to 30% per year. The worldwide installed capacity of onshore grid-connected wind power is about 40 GW. Turbine sizes have increased over the past two decades. In the mid-1980s, the rotor (blades and hub) diameter was about 20 m; today, rotor diameters are 100 m or more (bigger than the wingspan of a 747 aircraft), with the rotating blades covering an area the size of a football field.

This paper introduces an unsupervised vector ap- proach to disambiguate words in biomedical text us- ing contextual information from the UMLS. Our ap- proach makes disambiguation decisions for words that have the same ST unlike Humphrey et al. (2006). We believe that our approach shows promise and leads us to our goal of exploring the use of biomedical knowledge sources.

identical unigrams and exhibit similar semantics-based sequential structures. Hence SVM is not able to differentiate between positive and neutral relationships. To give an example the below sentence has features which are the same as a positive relationship but is labeled as neutral due to lack of contextual information. {\chemical P-ASA} {\relationship 2= increased} intracellular levels of {\chemical reactive oxygen species}. Finally we can also observe that the (1 vs. All) SVM schema behaves differently than the (2 vs. 2). The highest overall accuracy of (1 vs. all) is 0.89, generated by a feature combination of unigrams and unary semantics-based sequential features. We cannot however find any particular combination of kernels that constantly produce a high accuracy. In contrast, in the (2 vs. 2) schema, the linear and polynomial kernel combination tends to produce good results. In addition, (2 vs. 2) in general outperforms (1 vs. all) regardless of the feature set under use. We hence focus on the (2 vs. 2) scheme in the following discussion.

Long-term survivors of colorectal cancer report a good overall quality of life compared with that of the general population, but higher rates of depression.83 In addition, some difficulty with chronic diarrhea occurs in about one-half of colorectal cancer survivors.84 Bowel dysfunction (including increased stool fre- quency, incontinence, and perianal irritation) is common among rectal cancer survivors, especially those treated with pelvic radiation.85, 86 In addition, survivors may suffer from bladder dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, and negative body image.40, 87 Many of these issues are more common in rectal cancer survi- vors, particularly those with a colostomy.88 A trained ostomy therapist may be able to address several of these concerns, as well as issues that arise from colostomy care, such as skin irrita- tion and dietary considerations.89

Patients who reported any cancer diagnosis, physician-administered chemotherapy, or radiation therapy treatment in the 12 months preceding the date of diagnosis were removed from the analysis. Codes used to identify radiation therapy and physician-administered chemotherapy can be found in the Appendix. Patients identified as having lung, colorectal, or breast cancer in 2011 are included in the study. Males with breast cancer were excluded. Some patients were identified as having multiple cancers. These patients were assigned according to the following hierarchy:

islation. The following year, the California State Supreme Court overturned the merger legislation from over a decade prior, thus allowing the reinstatement of an osteo- pathic licensing board, a medical society, and a new school, now known as Western University of Health Sci- ences College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific. How- ever, the emergence of government-sponsored insurance and managed care programs brought about new chal- lenges for the osteopathic profession. DOs were histori- cally severely underrepresented in the decisions regarding Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement for osteopathic medical services. In fact, it was not until 1995 that the first DO was named to serve on the Physician Payment Review Commission, which advised Congress on policy con- cerning such reimbursements. Today, numerous issues, including physician reim- bursement, still surround osteopathic medicine. The most pertinent of these concerns are internship and resi- dency shortages, public awareness and perception, clinical research on OMM, DO-MD relations, and the effort to dis- tinguish DOs from MDs in light of the progressive blurring of distinctions between the two professions. All of these issues are quite complex and are further elaborated on later in this guidebook. 24% Average growth every 5 years in # of DOs since 1985

See Table 3 for results for this experiment. Relative perfor- mance on the weekly task is similar to its daily counter- part. Understandably, performance is best when optimized for and evaluated on smaller ranks for NDCG since weekly scientificarticlelistsarelongandtherearemoresuper popu- lar, possibly easier to rank, articles which can fill the top 7 or 35. Segmenting dates by week rather than day may be more realistic, since scientific articles compete for news coverage with articles published around the same time rather than just those published on the same day.

*Joint involvement refers to any swollen or tender joint on examina- tion. Distal interphalangeal joints, first carpometacarpal joints, and first metatarsophalangeal joints are excluded from assessment. Catego- ries of joint distribution are classified according to the location and numberoftheinvolvedjoints,withplacementintothehighestcategory possible based on the pattern of joint involvement. “Large joints” refers to shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and ankles. “Small joints” refers to the metacarpophalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal joints, second through fifth metatarsophalangeal joints, thumb inter- phalangeal joints, and wrists. “Symmetric” is defined as bilateral involvement of at least 1 region. In the category “(cid:5)10 joints,” at least 1 of the involved joints must be a small joint; the other joints can include any combination of large and additional small joints, as well as other joints not specifically listed elsewhere (e.g., temporomandibular, acromioclavicular, sternoclavicular, etc.). †Negative refers to IU values that are less than or equal to the upper limitofnormal(ULN)forthelaboratoryandassay;low-positiverefers to IU values that are higher than the ULN but (cid:3)3 times the ULN for the laboratory and assay; high-positive refers to IU values that are (cid:5)3 times the ULN for the laboratory and assay. Where rheumatoid factor (RF) information is only available as positive or negative, a positive result should be scored as low-positive for RF. ACPA (cid:2) anti(cid:3)citrullinated protein antibody.

that likely affects anxiety/mood symptoms via the M2 and/or M1 receptors of the CNS [19]. Scopolamine was known over a century ago to produce a calming effect in psychiatric patients [20], although this property is not well known today among medical providers. There is clinical evidence that other antimuscarinic agents (e.g., promethazine), can also provide some anxiolytic benefit [6]. Beta blockers and antimuscarinic agents are included in the PanX® combinations not only for pharmacologic targeting of the sympathetic beta-1 and parasympathetic M2/M1 receptors, but also in view of historic safety. Both classes of drugs have been used in millions of patients over five decades and are known to be safe. Neither class is addictive. In addition, the high prevalence of use strongly suggests that both classes of medicines have been coincidentally and/or concurrently used in the same patient(s) as separate prescriptions and/or OTC drugs, for instance a prescription beta blocker for hypertension and a prescription or OTC antimuscarinic agent for motion sickness, nausea, or vomiting. Even with high coincident and/or concurrent use, there is no evidence in the population of producing side effects or drug-drug interactions that extend beyond those inherent within either of the monotherapies. Prior to this open label study, case series resulting from physician- sponsored studies of compounded atenolol - scopolamine provided initial evidence of effectiveness in the PRN treatment of anxiety. Three patients diagnosed with PTSD, who experienced acute anxiety episodes, were treated effectively by a psychiatrist [7-9]. In addition, three patients with acute anxiety symptoms under the care of pain management physicians were treated successfully [10]. In the present physician-sponsored open label study we document a trial of a compounded combination drug regarding anxiolytic efficacy and with no side effects in eight adult patients. The drug combo produced a fast-acting and beneficial calming effect in 6 of 8 patients, who were deemed as responders. None of the patients described any side effects, and there was no evidence of impairment of cognition.

The findings reported above seem to suggest that there are important differences in the rhetorical organi- zation of introductions in Brazilian Portuguese articles from The ESPecialist and articles from English for Specific Purposes. While the latter fits the proposed moves in the CARS model closely, the former has been shown to vary from it somewhat. It is worth noting that both journals specialize in the same subfield of Applied Linguistics, a claim supported not only by the names of these journals, but also by the similar editorial policies they hold (see Appendix C). Even though English for Specific Purposes reaches a wider inter- national readership by being published in English, the current academic lingua franca (Duszak &amp; Lewkowicz, 2008), both journals started publication in the same year and can, therefore, be considered to have a similar level of maturity and tradition, at least in the eyes of the audience they reach. In this sense, the distinction made by Samraj (2005) between established fields and emerging fields of inquiry would not help explain the differences between the two sets of introductions analyzed in this study. It seems, thus, that the differences found would have to be attributed to cross-linguistic/cross-cultural reasons. The most striking difference between the BESP and the ESPj RAIs lies in the pervasive absence of Move 2 in the former. Other studies that looked at RAIs in languages other than English have found a similar pattern. As mentioned above, Jogthong (2001) reported an absence of Move 2 in 45% of the Thai articles studied while in Ahmad’s (1997) corpus of Malay RAIs 35% lacked a Move 2. In the present study, 70% of the RAIs in Portuguese did not contain this move, while only 10% of those in English lacked it.

Dispensing and Administering Chemotherapy Medications (Checkpoints 6–9). At checkpoint 6, before starting treat- ment, each chemotherapy medication should be checked in- dependently against the prescriber’s orders by at least two individuals who are trained and competent to administer chemotherapy medications. All dosage- and administration- rate-related calculations should be independently verified. This includes any infusion pump rate settings, which should be checked at the initiation of each container of the infu- sion, periodically throughout the infusion, and whenever a new nurse assumes care for the patient. Healthcare providers should routinely confirm that the medication will be admin- istered to the intended patient by comparing a patient’s name and unique identifying code or number with medication la- bels (e.g., alpha–numeric characters or bar codes) and that a drug product’s identity, ancillary components (e.g., addi-

and end-of-life issues, because diagnoses such as breast cancer are associated with increased CAM use in conjunction with con- ventional treatment (Deng et al., 2004; Mao et al., 2008). Nurses need to possess a good understanding of the survivor’s motiva- tion surrounding the use of CAM. Addressing unmet needs, side-effect management, and conducting an evaluation of the patient’s understanding of safety in these therapies is imperative in future survivor care. Because CAM use is more likely related to symptom treatment, such as pain, fatigue, and hot flashes (Mao et al., 2008), a thorough focus on side-effect management also is an essential component of survivorship.

Article downloads and citations measure two different dimensions of scientific knowledge transfer. The first measures general interest in a particular new piece of knowledge; the second measures the incorporation of that knowledge into a new document. Most article downloads take place within the first few months after publication (17, 18), suggesting that the primary func- tion of an article is to keep researchers abreast on the latest findings within a field and secondly to serve as a source document for future citation. Article downloads retrieved shortly after publication have been shown to predict future citations, although their strength of prediction is relatively low (17, 19, 20). A citation, on the other hand, measures a different set of intentions from a much smaller group of partic- ipants. To generate new scientific knowledge, in most cases, one must have access to equipment, materials and facilities, technicians, and the infrastructure neces- sary to support and coordinate them all (21). Authors must be able to analyze their results, capable of pre- senting their findings, and able to communicate them clearly and coherently. Once submitted, scientific man- uscripts must make it through peer-review and be published in an indexed journal in order to be visible

was achieved using 2 complementary approaches, mir- roring the approaches used in the first 2 phases: data- informed and consensus-based. From the consensus- based approach, the expert panel was asked to examine the rankings of case scenarios based on the new scoring system and to indicate, in their opinion, the point at which the cases changed from “probable” to “definite” RA. Four cases were excluded due to missing domain information (n (cid:2) 2) or ineligibility (2 cases were more likely another diagnosis). For the remaining 50 cases, the mean cut point defining definite RA was 65.7 (median 66.1; range 60.0–70.3) of a total possible score of 100. A data-driven verification of that cut point was then attempted, in which the new scoring system was applied to 3 of the existing cohorts used for Phase 1 (the Etude et Suivi des Polyarthrites Indifferenciees Re- centes data set from France, the Norwegian data set, and the Rotterdam Early Arthritis Cohort data set from Rotterdam) (25). These cohorts were chosen based on the completeness of data and the collected variables, enabling calculation of the patients’ probability scores at baseline. The disease characteristics of these cohorts were not substantively different from those of the re- maining cohorts (data not shown). The area under the curve (AUC) for the 3 receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (which plot sensitivity against 1 (cid:3) specificity for the range of scores) indicated good discrimination of those who did versus those who did not receive MTX (or another DMARD/biologic agent) within a year (AUC 0.82 for Norway, 0.66 for France, and AUC 0.69 for Rotterdam; P (cid:4) 0.0001 for all). The probability scores similarly discriminated between those who fulfilled the 1987 ACR criteria at 12 months and those who did not (AUC for the ROC curves 0.88 [Norway], 0.67 [France], and 0.72 [Rotterdam]). Visual inspection of the diagnostic test parameters associated with curves that used MTX initi- ation as the outcome showed a maximum slope for both the positive and negative likelihood ratios between a score of 60/100 and 70/100, with flattening thereafter (67 in the Norway cohort, 66 in the French cohort, and 66 in the Rotterdam cohort). The cut point of 60–70 that was derived from expert consensus was therefore supported by these data. Given the consistency with the consensus- based approach, and to maximize sensitivity of the criteria, a cut point of 60 was deemed to be most appropriate. Rationale for the composition and weight of the final criteria. For development of the final criteria set, the results and weights from the comprehensive Phase 2 process (26) were used as a starting point. Based on

explaining this behaviour. Firstly, as indicated by a widely-cited study by a global consulting firm, increasing price would generate larger improvement in profit than other levers of profit (Fig. 3.7, p.31) (150). This may have influenced repeated price increases noted in the market for cancer medicines (147,151) and indeed, markets for patented and generic medicines in other therapeutic areas (152–154). Secondly, as there are many factors influencing demand of medicines other than price (50), it would be sensible for companies focused solely on maximizing profits to focus on price because as it has been said “price is certainty and volume is a bet”.
such as article type, discipline, and funding source, (9), for example, none were able to control for abstract qualities such as relevance, novelty, and importance to a field of study, variables that are unobservable to the researcher. In addition, an author’s willingness and ability to pay open access publishing fees, some amounting to several thousands of dollars, may make simple performance comparisons with subscription- access articles highly problematic (12). By randomly altering access status in an experimental trial, we are able to isolate and measure the effects of access on readership and citations independently of other con- founding variables.

time to fall asleep (sleep latency), number of awakenings, wake time after sleep onset (WASO), sleep duration, and napping can be quantified retrospectively during the clinical assessment and prospectively with sleep-wake logs. Although no specific quan- titative sleep parameters define insomnia disorder, common complaints for insomnia patients are an average sleep latency &gt;30 minutes, wake after sleep onset &gt;30 minutes, sleep effi- ciency &lt;85%, and/or total sleep time &lt;6.5 hours.19,20 Day-to-day variability should be considered, as well as variability during longer periodicities such as those that may occur with the men- strual cycle or seasons. Patterns of sleep at unusual times may assist in identifying Circadian Rhythm Disorders such as Ad- vanced Sleep Phase Type or Delayed Sleep Phase Type. Assess- ing whether the final awakening occurs spontaneously or with an alarm adds insight into the patient’s sleep needs and natural sleep and wake rhythm. Finally, the clinician must ascertain whether the individual’s sleep and daytime complaints occur despite adequate time available for sleep, in order to distinguish insomnia from behaviorally induced insufficient sleep. IV. Nocturnal Symptoms: Patient and bed partner reports may also help to identify nocturnal signs, symptoms and behav- iors associated with breathing-related sleep disorders (snoring, gasping, coughing), sleep related movement disorders (kick- ing, restlessness), parasomnias (behaviors or vocalization), and comorbid medical/neurological disorders (reflux, palpitations, seizures, headaches). Other physical sensations and emotions associated with wakefulness (such as pain, restlessness, anxi- ety, frustration, sadness) may contribute to insomnia and should also be evaluated. V. Daytime Activities and Daytime Function: Daytime activities and behaviors may provide clues to potential causes and consequences of insomnia. Napping (frequency/day, times, voluntary/involuntary), work (work times, work type such as driving or with dangerous consequences, disabled, caretaker responsibilities), lifestyle (sedentary/active, home- bound, light exposure, exercise), travel (especially across time zones), daytime dysfunction (quality of life, mood, cog- nitive dysfunction), and exacerbation of comorbid disorders should be evaluated in depth. Common daytime consequences include:

Each framework differs in terms of its audience, development process, and measures of benefit and cost. NCCN and ASCO are patient/provider facing, but ICER is targeted to payers. Methodological transparency also varies: ICER and ASCO have open comment periods and update their approaches based on stakeholder input, while NCCN has no formal public comment process. A comparison of the frameworks on multiple dimensions appears in Tables 1 and 2.

Known robot activity (software robots downloading all free material for indexing purposes, e.g., Google) was removed from the data set before analysis to arrive at a more accurate estimate of human activity. Citation figures were gathered monthly from the Web of Science (http://www.isiknowledge.com) for the first 3 yr after article publication. While journals control the primary access route to articles, it is common in some disciplines and at some institutions for authors to self-archive some version of their articles on public websites or in digital repositories. To obtain an estimate of the extent and effects of self-archiving, we wrote a Perl script to search for PDF copies of articles anywhere on the Internet (ignoring the publisher’s website) 1 yr after publication. We attempted to identify as many instances of self-archiving as possible, while minimizing the number of false positives.

Even with sufficient clinical trial evidence at the time of regulatory approval, it is important to recognize that the benefits may not be realized in clinical practice because of a range of reasons, such as bias in measuring outcomes in clinical trials or underreporting of adverse events (78).

An advantage of a power analysis is that it can be used to explore the implications of negative results, i.e. those in which there is no significant difference between treatment means. Such negative results might be of bio- logical interest, particularly in safety testing, if they are real, but are of little interest if the lack of statistical significance was because the experiment was too small to detect a treatment difference of potential interest. Thus, a power analysis can be used to find out the probability that the experiment would have been able to detect a specified treatment effect if it was really there. For example, in the diet experiment discussed previously, suppose that an experiment had been undertaken to compare the two diets with ten mice per group, and that the mean

Continuing to play immediately following a concussion is a risk for increased symptom burden, worsening of the injury and prolonged recovery.92–95 Athletes who return to sport prior to full recovery are at increased risk of repeat concussion.96 Some research has demonstrated that athletes who return to sport after SRC following standard return to sport protocols had an increased rate of musculoskeletal injury.97 98 The ‘Second Impact Syndrome’ is both rare and controversial. It is considered by some to be a potentially life-threatening complication of reinjury during the initial postinjury time period that is not fully under- stood and appears primarily limited to paediatric and adolescent athletes.99 (C)

Since effective treatment depends upon an accurate and effective diagnosis, misdiagnosis can also lead to inappropriate or unnecessary testing, such as biopsies and treatment that may cause harm. A study by the Rand Corporation discovered that 30% of common surgical procedures, including coronary artery bypass graft surgery, were provided for reasons that were not supported by clinical studies and/or evidence-based treatment guidelines and may have resulted in complications or harm to the patients.8

The randomised block design provides a means to break down an experiment into smaller parts, which can be handled more conveniently. In most cases, it will increase the precision at no extra cost, apart from the need for a slightly more-complex statistical analysis.

• Sensitivity and  specificity dependent
Some chemotherapy and targeted therapy drugs may cause skin problems, including redness, blistering, itching, peeling, dryness, rashes, acne, and sensitivity to the sun. Some targeted therapy drugs can also cause an extensive rash over the face, neck, and chest. Most of these skin problems go away after treatment is fin- ished, but symptoms of an allergic reaction, including sudden or severe itching, rash, or hives, should be reported right away. Radiation may cause skin to become red, irritated, and swollen, which might worsen to become blistered, peeling, or even open sores. Most skin reactions to radiation slowly go away after treatment, although skin may remain darker than it was before.

A recent analysis of US managed care data revealed similar costs for initial therapy in men with prostate cancer [ 18 ] . During the fi rst 2 years after diagnosis, the average total cost across all patients was $48 808, with $29 417 representing prostate cancer-related costs. Those patients receiving treatment incurred costs fi ve times higher than those undergoing watchful waiting ($38 945 vs $7595). The highest costs were incurred within the fi rst 3 months after diagnosis and decreased substantially over time. Among patients receiving initial treatment, surgery incurred costs of $31 666 with the majority attributable to inpatient costs ($26 539).

number of cancer cases (O/E) among cancer survivors in popu- lation-based cancer registries are used to describe the risk for a subsequent cancer diagnosis, with the number expected based on cancer occurrence in the general population. As a whole, can- cer survivors have a small increased risk of additional cancers, although risk is higher for those with a history of childhood can- cer (Figure 15, page 25), as well as for adult survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma and tobacco-related cancers (oral cavity and pharynx, lung and bronchus, kidney and renal pelvis, esophagus, and urinary bladder) (Figure 16).

In this section, we report the main results to demonstrate that the proposed feature space can effectively predict the polarity and strength of the relationships extracted from biomedical literature. These results also indicate that not every feature contributes equally to the two problems under study. The annotated corpus described in section 2 is used for our evaluation studies. (See Tables 4-5 for the corpus distribution according to polarity and strength.) We perform 10-fold cross validation throughout our evaluation. Classification accuracy is primarirly used to measure the performance of each SVM, whereas prediction accuracy is used for each SVR. We use the SVMLight package by [23] for our experiments.

Any proposed automated medical diagnosis system, which is constructed using data mining methodology, will help the doctors to diagnose the correct disease in less time [33]. Table:1 highlights a few of such system’s leading objectives along with their associated authors working in the field of predicting medical disease(s) using data mining technique. Common data mining techniques which are used in almost all the sectors are listed as: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Artificial neural network (ANN), K- nearest neighborhood (KNN), Support vector machine (SVM) etc. In order to improve the success of healthcare organization and health of the patients, the knowledge gained by data mining can be exercised for booming research problems in the associated arena [33].

Pain assessment involves more than just quantifying theintensityofpain.Highpainintensityratingsorbehav- ioralscalescoresthatdonotrespondtousualcareshould be investigated to determine whether the pain might be due to a new medical issue or surgical complication and the potential role of opioid tolerance and psychological distress. Assessment should determine what interven- tions have been effective for the pain, how the pain af- fects function, the type of pain (eg, neuropathic, visceral, somatic, muscle spasms), and whether there are barriers to effective pain management, such as cultural orlanguagedifferences,cognitivedeficits,orpatientmis- conceptions about pain management (Table 2). In addi- tion, it is not sufficient to assess pain only at rest. Pain that is relativelywell controlled at rest canbe severe dur- ing movement or with specific activities that cause increased pain (eg, swallowing after tonsillectomy), with important implications for symptom management and recovery. The panel suggests that clinicians assess pain at rest and with activities, as the latter is often more severe and difficult to control than pain at rest.110,270 Presence of pain with activity has important implications for use of additional interventions and discharge planning. For example, pain that is well controlled at rest but severe with movement can have major effects on a patient’s ability to participate in postsurgical rehabilitation and return to normal function, and pain with swallowing after tonsillectomy could increase risk for dehydration. Assessments for other clinical issues such as sedation, delirium, and nausea or other side effects related to interventions are also important to help guide decisions regarding adjustmentofthe postoperativepain management plan. There is insufficient evidence to guide firm recom- mendations on optimal timing or frequency of patient reassessments in the postoperative setting. The timing of assessments after administration of an intervention should be informed by the time to achieve peak ef- fects, which is typically 15 to 30 minutes after paren- teral drug therapy or 1 to 2 hours after administration of an oral analgesic. With nonpharma- cologic interventions, pain relief often occurs during or immediately after their application. The optimal fre- quency of reassessment is likely to depend on a num- ber of factors, including the type of surgical procedure, the adequacy of initial pain relief, the pres- ence of side effects, presence of comorbidities, and
In 2019, the MDH Public Health Laboratory (MDH-PHL) implemented a multiplex real-time PCR that detects three CRAB-specific carbapenemase genes (OXA-23, OXA-24, and OXA-58). The MDH-PHL currently tests all CRAB isolates received through sentinel surveillance for OXA-23, OXA-24, and OXA-58, along with five other carbapenemase genes (KPC, NDM, OXA-48, IMP, and VIM). Approximately 20% of the CRAB isolates tested from Minnesota facilities are carbapenemase-producing (CP), with the majority producing OXA-23 or OXA-24. Rapid identification of CP-CRAB and immediate implementation of infection control measures are key to controlling transmission in health care facilities.

In analyzing article citations, 1 was added to each citation count prior to log transformation as some articles received 0 citations during the observation period. While adding 1 shifts the citation distribution to the right, we were interested primarily in the slopes of the regression lines and not their intercepts. To interpret the results of the regression equation, estimates of log-transformed variables were exponentiated in order to arrive at their multiplicative effect (ME). For exam- ple, if the logCitation estimate were 0.5, the ME of this estimate would be e0.5 or 1.65, representing a 65% increase in citations.

Table 11. Cancer site abbreviations in column 1 are the same as in Table 3. Column 2 = mean estimated spending based on [NCI, 2017b] (which uses the “head-and-neck” nomenclature for Oral = oral cavity and pharynx cancer), and column 3 = standard deviation (see Subsection 6.2). Column 4 = number of estimated new incidences as reported in [ACS, 2017] and [Siegel et al, 2017]. Column 5 = estimated per-new-incidence spending. The factors (column 6) and rate (column 7) are taken from Table 10 for breast, colorectal, lung and prostate cancers and melanoma (bold font). For other cancer sites the factor is extrapolated from the values in Table 10 (italicized font) and rate is taken from Table 3 (regular font) or extrapolated therefrom (italicized font). See Subsection 6.1. The relative cost-savings (column 8) are obtained via Eq. (12) and Eq. (13), and cost-savings from early diagnosis (column 9) via Eq. (15), where the factor is set to 1 for all cancer sites except breast cancer, for which .

This presumably would ensure companies not accruing excessive returns for medicines with long periods of exclusivity. It might also incentivize the companies to work with clinicians for faster adoption of the medicines in clinical practice so as to maintain its profitability through increased volume.

Treatment for cancers of the colon and rectum varies by tumor location, characteristics, and stage. Surgical procedures for colorectal cancer include local tumor excision or destruction, colectomy (removal of all or part of the colon), proctectomy (removal of the rectum), and proctocolectomy (removal of the rectum and all or part of the colon). The majority of early stage (I and II) colon cancers are treated with colectomy alone (84%), while most patients with stage III disease receive chemotherapy in addition to surgery (67%) (Figure 6, page 11).

There are many various design procedures for cavity walls. Both rational and empirical design methods are used. Rational design methods currently use working stress analysis. Limit states or strength design methods are now being written. Other methods such as a modified yield line approach, fracture line approach and elastic performance of cracked panels have been proposed for the design of unreinforced walls. However, insufficient data and lack of recognition by model building codes relegate these methods to use as special systems for design.

LOCAL   E DATA:
From Table 6, one can observe that the positive polarity constantly has high accuracy for both methods as compared to the other polarities. One main reason we believe is that the annotated corpus has a large number of positive examples as shown in Table 4. We also observe that the “no-relationship” has a constantly high accuracy and is not influenced by other feature combinations. The reason behind this is that the unigrams found in the relationships that have “no relationship” polarity often contain unique negation terms such as “no” and ‘not”. Therefore unigrams alone are often sufficient. The accuracy of neutral relationships is low because neutral and positive relationships tend to contain

Similar to the ranking experiments, we repeat the matched sample experiment on the subset of articles which received a press release. We find 3,398 matched pairs and confirm that the positive and negative instances do not have dispro- portionate skew towards any one outlet. Using all features, logistic regression achieves an F1 of 0.5794. Table 7 lists the top features for these results. Top negative features ap- pear to be those related to more technical scientific work, such as “proteins” and “genes” “expression”, while positive features are related to health, such as “fat,” “screening,” and “Project HOPE,” a publisher of health policy articles. Sur- prisingly, the American Chemical Society is a positive fea- ture and “medicine” is a negative feature when occurring in the title.

on a subset of the press releases they read each day, either found on a press release aggregation website such as Eu- rekAlert! or Science Daily or sent to them by media offices. Discovering what sort of content journalists believe is sig- nificant and likely to be popular provides insight into how journalists judge the newsworthiness of different content, uncovering their biases and preferences, and helps shed light on high-profile issues being actively debated relating to the “science of science communication” (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2017). Scholars who have studied the decision-making of jour- nalists in terms of story selection and framing have exam- ined various factors, from institutional and economic incen- tives to a need for social validation (Donsbach 2004). In the realm of science, practices such as embargoing of scholarly findings and the attendant effects on communication have been examined, suggesting that certain science communica- tions and public relations strategies can influence news cov- erage (Kiernan 2003b). Research has suggested that jour- nalists seldom choose to report on scientific studies outside of the domains of health and medicine (Suleski and Ibaraki 2009). Issues of hype and errors of framing and omission have long plagued various forms of news media and science communication, with the cycle of hype sometimes begin- ning with researchers themselves using exaggerated terms such as “breakthrough” in press materials and public an- nouncements (Bubela et al. 2009). News reporting may then replicate the exaggerations found in such communi- cations materials (Sumner et al. 2014). Further, news sto- ries, particularly those produced by elite outlets, may influ- ence the prestige of, and citations to, scientific research, fu- eling a hype cycle that is increasingly coming under scrutiny in the research and media communities (Kiernan 2003a; Caulfield et al. 2016).

The 5- and 10-year relative survival rates for colorectal cancer are 65% and 58%, respectively. When colorectal cancer is detected at an early stage, the 5-year survival rate is 90% (Figure 5, page 9); however, only 39% of cases are diagnosed at this stage (Figure 4, page 8), in part due to the underuse of screening.

Finally, we have also compared the effect of the no-relationship polarity by comparing the overall accuracy of (i) combining no- relationship and neutral polarities into one category; and (ii) separating them into two classes. We observe that the overall accuracy of the former ranges between 0.71~0.81 as compared to 0.8~0.91 in the latter when they are separated. This demonstrates the necessity of introducing the “no-relationship” as its own class.

Sheet metals used for flashing include stainless steel, copper, lead-coated copper and galvanized steel. Aluminum should not be used since it can corrode in fresh mortar. Stainless steel and copper materials are the most durable, but are also the most expensive. Galvanized steel has also been used in limited applications. These flashing materials have a greater life expectancy than composite or fabric flashing. Sheet metal flashing is bent and formed on site and sealed by soldering or with adhesives and rivets. This additional installation time can result in additional construction costs. Stainless steel materials should conform the ASTM A 167 Specification for Stainless and Heat-Resisting Steel Plate, Sheet and Strip. Copper flashing should comply with ASTM B 370 Specification for Copper Sheet and Strip for Building Construction. Solder should conform to ASTM B 32 Specification for Solder Metal.

been compared with the other possible conditions and there was no significant difference between them but graph slope between these three points. Here in the first part from 30 to 45 minutes, the possible reason could be increase abrasion time and as a result, more peaks are removed. Therefore, surface roughness in this region improves and there will be a finer surface than first. However, in the second part from 45 to 60 minutes, excess abrasion time makes fine surface scratched by continuing abrasion after removal of peaks. However, this conclusion may not be completely true or even may not be the only reason, because abrasive particles will be abraded themselves after such a long period of finishing. Here this hypothesis appears that maybe, probable abrasive particle fracture due to smash through finishing process makes them sharp again and these new sharp cutting edges even in smaller size, continue abrasion and make surface ragged. After investigating these parameters independently, it worth compare them together to get a general layout form their behavior. Figure 6 illustrates their effect on surface roughness in different conditions. Table 1 shows the order of experiments that are shown in Figure 6.

“Insomnia” has been used in different contexts to refer to either a symptom or a specific disorder. In this guideline, an insomnia disorder is defined as a subjective report of difficulty with sleep initiation, duration, consolidation, or quality that oc- curs despite adequate opportunity for sleep, and that result in some form of daytime impairment (Table 2). Except where otherwise noted, the word “insomnia” refers to an insomnia disorder in this guideline. Insomnia disorders have been categorized in various ways in different sleep disorder classification systems. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2) is used as the basis for insomnia classification in this guideline. The ICSD-2 identifies insomnia as one of eight major categories of sleep disorders and, within this group, lists twelve specific in- somnia disorders (Table 3).

Choosing a doctor to treat cancer is one of the most important decisions for newly diagnosed cancer patients. Typically, the doctor who made the preliminary diagnosis, usually the patient’s primary care physician, will recommend appropriate cancer specialists. There are three main types of cancer physicians or oncologists, based on the type of treatment service they provide: medical (those who treat cancer using chemotherapy and other drugs), surgical, and radiation. Some types of oncologists focus on specific populations. For example, pediatric oncologists spe- cialize in the care of children, and hematologists specialize in patients with blood disorders. Some cancers, such as skin and prostate cancer, may be treated by doctors who specialize in specific body systems (i.e., dermatologists and urologists, respectively). Plastic surgeons may also be involved in cancer treatment by performing reconstructive surgeries as part of cancer care, particularly for patients with breast or head and neck cancers.

The essential feature of this disorder is insomnia caused by a coexisting medical disorder or other physiological factor. Although insomnia is commonly associated with many medi- cal conditions, this diagnosis should be used when the insomnia causes marked distress or warrants separate clinical attention. This diagnosis is not used to explain insomnia that has a course independent of the associated medical disorder, and is not routinely made in individu- als with the “usual” severity of sleep symptoms for an associated medical disorder. These two diagnoses are used for insomnia disorders that cannot be classified elsewhere but are suspected to be related to underlying mental disorders, psychological factors, behaviors, medical disorders, physiological states, or substance use or exposure. These diagnoses are typically used when further evaluation is required to identify specific associated conditions, or when the patient fails to meet criteria for a more specific disorder.

Generally, ΔKi is half the difference between the strike prices on either side of K i. For example, the ΔK for the next-term 1325 Put is 37.5: ΔK 1325 Put = (1350 – 1275)/2. At the upper and lower edges of any given strip of options, ΔK i is simply the difference between K i and the adjacent strike price. In this example, the 1370 Put is the lowest strike in the strip of near- term options and 1375 is the adjacent strike. Therefore, ΔK 1370 Put = 5 (i.e., 1375 – 1370).

Restoring the health of the housing market is a necessary part of a broader strategy for economic recovery. There has been much discussion about the pathway forward, and the Federal Reserve has received questions and requests for our input and assistance. We have been looking at these issues and in the interest of continuing a dialogue, my staff has written a white paper, entitled "The U.S. Housing Market: Current Conditions and Policy Considerations." In this report, we do not attempt to address every problem faced by the housing market; rather, it is our intention to provide a framework for thinking about certain issues and tradeoffs that policymakers might consider.

Table 3 shows the accuracy of the results obtained by our unsupervised vector approach using the CUI→ST context description, SenseClusters, and the results reported by Humphrey et al. (2006). As seen with the context description results, there exists a large difference in accuracy on a word by word basis between the approaches. The results show that Humphrey et al. (2006) report a higher overall accuracy compared to SenseClusters and our approach. Although, Humphrey et al. (2006) per- formed better for 5 out of the 13 words where as SenseClusters performed better for 9. The unigram feature set with gap cluster stopping returned the highest overall accuracy for SenseClusters. The number of clusters for all of the gap cluster stopping experiments were two except for growth which re- turned one. For our approach, the unigram feature set returned the highest overall accuracy.

The estimated risk for a traveller acquiring malaria differs markedly from area to area.2,36,37,45,46 This variability is a function of the intensity of transmission within the various regions, the season of travel, and of the itinerary and type of travel.36,37 Ongoing malaria transmission occurs in large areas of Central and South America, Hispaniola, Africa, the Indian subcontinent, southeast Asia, the middle east, eastern Europe, and the south Pacific islands.1,2,5,10,35,36,43,44 There has been a marked increased in tourism, immigration, and refugee, student, and business travel to these malaria-endemic areas.25,30,47 International migration has risen from 120 million in 1990 to 175 million in 2002.28 Non- immune individuals are particularly susceptible to develop severe malaria if exposed to an infected mosquito, particularly in areas with high levels of transmission.2,5,14,19,36,45,46 Some groups are at higher risk. Immigrants to developed countries who are returning to homes and families in endemic countries (visiting friends and relatives) are at much higher risk of acquiring malaria.24,30–33 Indeed, this particular group of travellers is responsible for a high volume of international travellers and experience excessive rates of travel-related morbidity including malaria and its

To put these figures in perspective, the average monthly healthcare spending for people in our data diagnosed with type 2 diabetes was about $1,600 in 2014.19 Pre-diagnosis, cancer patients spent, on average, less than diabetes patients. The post-diagnosis monthly healthcare spending for the three cancers studied stabilized near or above the diabetes patient level after several months. This finding suggests that, for survivors, a diagnosis of cancer, like the diagnosis of a chronic condition, results in persistent healthcare spending.

Another beta blocker is nadolol, which is non-selective and with a preference for beta-1 receptors. It does not pass through the blood-brain barrier. In a clinical trial with musicians, nadolol reduced pulse rate and improved one aspect of performance related to tremor [48]. A similar result was obtained for nadolol in students’ singing performance [49]. In spite of being non- selective, nadolol might ironically benefit the pulmonary function in asthma patients based upon the appropriate dosage, an anti-intuitive result [50].

We find 8,436 matched pairs. We train logistic regres- sion with the same train-test split (days 1-277, days 278- 365). Using all features, logistic regression achieves an F1 of 0.6037. Although many of the positive feature are sensi- ble and similar to those found in the ranking experiments and previous research (Wallace, Paul, and Elhadad 2015; Zhang et al. 2016), we find that the negative features are dominated by alzheimers and dementia related terms in the title and abstract. These results are indicative of an oddity in the dataset provided by Altmetric, specifically the web- site Alzforum. Alzforum is an information resource web- site for alzheimers researchers and is one of the websites included in Altmetric’s news crawl. Most of the Alzforum articles tracked by Altmetric post only article metadata, and the website was marked as a non-news source due to its super high rate of publication. Before sampling, Alzforum covers 8,347 of the 34,329 scientific articles with no real coverage and is the highest frequency outlet on that subset. However, it covers only 667 of the 57,668 scientific articles with real coverage. Of 8,436 matched pairs, Alzforum cov- ers 1,380 negative and 224 positive samples. Although we control for subjects, they are typically more general, such as “neuroscience,” “psychology and cognitive sciences,” and “geriatrics and gerontology.” Thus, we are unable to control for specific topics, such as alzheimers, and logistic regres- sion learns that most alzheimers articles are unpopular.

This Technical Note describes the mechanisms of efflorescence, including possible sources of salts and water, providing a basic understanding of the phenomenon of efflorescence that is essential to minimize its occurrence. Although similar, sources of salts and the development of efflorescence on paving surfaces are discussed in the Technical Notes 14 Series on brick pavements. A thorough program of efflorescence prevention or control may include identification of the type of efflorescence and investigation of its causes before options for correction are considered. This Technical Note is intended to serve as a guide in this process. Procedures for removal of efflorescence are discussed in Technical Note 20.

Value-based pricing or value pricing aims to determine the prices of medicines according to the value or worth that patients and health systems attribute to the medicines. In theory, by linking price to value, value- based approaches are more likely to encourage companies to innovate and produce medicines with attributes that society and governments value most. In the context of medicines this would mean the public and government would be willing to pay for medicines that improve health conditions and minimize harms.

The use of personal data is critical to ensure quality and reliability in scientific research. The new Regulation [European Union (EU)] 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data [general data protection regulation (GDPR)], repealing Directive 95/46/EC, strengthens and harmonises the rules for protecting individuals’ privacy rights and freedoms within and, under certain conditions, outside the EU territory. This new and historic legal milestone both prolongs and updates the EU acquis of the previous Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC. The GDPR fixes both general rules applying to any kind of personal data processing and specific rules applying to the processing of special categories of personal data such as health data taking place in the context of scientific research, this including clinical and translational research areas. This article aims to provide an overview of the new rules to consider where scientific projects include the processing of personal health data, genetic data or biometric data and other kinds of sensitive information whose use is strictly regulated by the GDPR in order to give the main key facts to researchers to adapt their practices and ensure compliance to the EU law to be enforced in May 2018.

It is usually not advisable to wash efflores- cence off of the brickwork except in warm, dry weather, since this results in the availability of considerably more moisture which may bring more salts to the surface. Many efflorescing salts can be removed by dry brushing. For recommendations concerning removing efflorescence and other stains on masonry walls, see Technical Note 20. Special care should be exercised in cleaning new masonry, since improper procedures and errors can contribute to or cause efflorescence or stains.

on cancer medicines (alone). For example, the treatment cost for one patient with chronic myeloid leukaemia for a year would be between US$ 800 and US$ 96 700 for imatinib and US$ 800 to US$ 109 400 for dasatinib, which are higher than the per-person budget of US$ 800 to US$ 40 600 estimated in Table 4.2. The unaffordability was even more prominent when considering the standard treatment regimen for early stage HER2- positive breast cancer, where the estimated costs ranged between US$ 18 500 and US$ 71 000. These examples suggest that, at current prices, universal coverage of cancer medicines (alone) will greatly exceed 5% of total expenditure on health care. This is unaffordable and unsustainable.

T here are two main distinctions between osteopathic and allopathic physicians. The first, more obvious difference lies in the osteopathic physicians’ use of osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM). While OMM is most commonly known by the general public to treat neuromusculoskeletal injury, DOs may utilize it in their diagnosis and treatment of disease involving internal organs and all other parts of the body as well. The other, more subtle – and arguably more important – distinction between the two professions is that osteopathic medicine offers a concise philosophy on which all clinical practice is based. Central to this philosophy is the belief that the body has an inherent healing mechanism that allows it to maintain health, resist illness, and recover from disease processes. The goal of osteopathic medical treatment is

As formas atuais de correção da visão nestes casos são: 1) Óculos; 2) Lentes de contato; 3) Transplante de Córnea. Normalmente, os óculos não produzem visão com qualidade, sendo que a maioria dos pacientes utilizam lentes de contato. Casos avançados da doença, geralmente quando as formas de tratamento anteriores não são mais suficientes, podem necessitar de trans- plante de córnea (troca da córnea doente por uma córnea doada). Desde 1996, o Anel de Ferrara vem sendo utilizado com o objetivo de aplanar e regularizar a córnea, na tentativa de melhorar a qualidade visual. Já é considerado procedimento aprovado pelo CFM (Conselho Federal de Me- dicina). Neste procedimento, a anestesia é tópica (com colírio). Após, é realizado um pequeno corte na córnea, em torno de 1mm, por onde são implantados os anéis intracorneanos (1 ou 2). Os anéis são feitos de acrílico (polimetilmetacrilato) e são introduzidos no interior da córnea. É uma técnica reversível (os anéis podem ser removidos se produzirem algum efeito indesejado). Na grande maioria dos casos, o procedimento cirúrgico é realizado em um período de 15 (quin- ze) a 30 (trinta) minutos. A recuperação visual é gradual, ocorrendo de maneira mais significativa na primeira semana, mas pode levar até meses de estabilização. O procedimento a laser em geral, é mais rápido e os túneis para implante do anel são confeccio- nados de maneira mais precisa. A prescrição dos óculos, ou lentes de contato pode ser necessária para melhorar a visão após o procedimento cirúrgico. 3. Benefícios do procedimento proposto: Com a realização do procedimento cirúrgico de implante do anel intracorneano pode ocorrer diminuição do grau de astigmatismo e melhora da visão. O resultado não é garantido. O paciente pode necessitar de um transplante de córnea se o implante do anel intracorneano não trouxe os benefícios esperados. Estes procedimentos ci- rúrgicos não melhoram os danos causados à visão por problemas da retina, glaucoma ou outras doenças oculares.

Resistance to transmission of sound in masonry construction is accomplished in two ways: the use of heavy massive walls or the use of discontinuous construction. The cavity wall employs both techniques, i.e., the massiveness of the two masonry wythes plus the partial discontinuity of the cavity.

We have also built various SVR models using different feature combinations fro strength analysis. The average accuracy from 10-fold cross validation is shown in Table 11. Note that all the results are generated using a linear kernel based SVR. From Table 11 we observe that all the feature combinations deliver approximately similar high-quality results. In other words, the addition of bigrams and semantics-based structural features does not improve the overall performance. This indicates that using unigrams alone is sufficient for the strength prediction task. The main reason behind this phenomenon is that unlike polarity of a relationship, the strength of a relationship is often directly associated with the specific words used in the relationship- depicting phrase. For instance, the sentence “Soy consumption significantly reduces the risk of cancer.” has a strong strength. The word “significantly” carries the most weight for the SVR model to make the correct prediction. This also explains why the addition of other semantics based features does not help in general. Another observation we have made is that the linear kernel constantly outperforms the other kernels. Finally, we notice that the medium strength achieves the highest accuracy as against

warming or internet commerce” and the need for social and natural scientists to “forget about what separates them and start looking at those ‘things’ whose hybrid nature has, for many dec- ades now, already unified them in practice.” Arguably, the economic nature of human activity (represented by lines representing different streams of literature in Figure 1) has changed substan- tively on account of two revolutions in work practice, namely, the industrial and knowledge revo- lutions, which enabled radically enhanced productivity improvements and a sea change in social theory in their wake. It is suggested here that societal, business, and biomedical ethics are not in- dependent of these changes, and that the post-industrial paradigm, with its ethics premised on social theory developed in response to industrialisation, has been disrupted by a further productiv- ity revolution which has increased the returns to knowledge in production, and that divergence has occurred between ethical thought premised on industrialised logics and a new ethics based on exponential increases in the power of knowledge to generate social and scientific change.

(cid:2) The panel recommends that clinicians offer multi- modal analgesia, or the use of a variety of analgesic medications and techniques combined with non- pharmacological interventions, for the treatment of postoperative pain in children and adults (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Multimodal analgesia, defined as the use of a variety of analgesic medication and techniques that target different mechanisms of action in the peripheral and/or central nervous system (which might also be combined with nonpharmacological interventions) might have ad- ditiveorsynergisticeffectsandmoreeffectivepainrelief compared with single-modality interventions. For example, clinicians might offer local anesthetic-based regional (peripheral and neuraxial) analgesic techniques in combination with systemic opioids and other analge- sics as part of a multimodal approach to perioperative pain. Because of the availability of effective nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies for postop- erative pain management, the panel suggests that clini- cians routinely incorporate around the clock nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies into multi- modal analgesia regimens. Systemic opioids might not be required in all patients. One study suggests that it shouldbeavoidedwhennotneeded,becauselimitedev- idence suggests that perioperative opioid therapy might be associated with increased likelihood of long-term opioid use, with its attendant risks.4

As you know, my office represents the City and County of San Francisco, including its Health Officer Dr. Aragón, who has issued a stay-safe-at-home order and related health orders to protect the residents of this City during this unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. (See https://www.sfdph.org/dph/alerts/coronavirus-healthorders.asp.) Dr. Aragón understands and respects the importance of religion to the spiritual well-being and mental health of many, and accordingly has encouraged San Franciscans to continue to practice their religious faith in all ways that are safe. It is for this reason that the Health Officer issued a revised health order on June 11, 2020 (Order of the Health Officer No. C19-07e, the “Health Order”), which allows for in-person outdoor services conducted according to science-based safeguards that will minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission.

Racking. Chimneys are generally not as wide as the body of the fireplace below. When racking back to achieve the desired dimensions or location of the chimney care must be exercised to insure that, since there is no limitation on the distance each unit may be racked, cores of the units are not exposed. Preferred construction consists of a setting bed over the racked face with uncored or paving brick set to provide a weather resistant surface. Mortar washes may also be used. They may not, however, be as durable. When using a mortar wash it should not bridge over the rack, but should fill each step individually. Both methods of racking are shown in Fig. 6.

Single-wythe chimneys should be attached to the structure. This is generally accomplished by using corrosion- resistant metal ties spaced at a maximum of 24 in. (600 mm) on center. Multi-wythe chimneys that are not masonry bonded should be bonded together using metal wire ties.

Do not use unbuffered muriatic acid. Use of unbuffered muriatic acid solutions tend to cause further stains and damage mortar joints. Many proprietary cleaners contain acids, however, their formulations include other chemicals that make them safer, easier to use properly and more environmentally responsible.

Data exploration has recently been hailed as the fourth paradigm in the investigation of nature, after empiricism, theory and computation (Bell, Hey &amp; Szalay, 2009). Whether in astronomy or the life sciences, the flood of data requires sophisticated methods of handling. For example, researchers in bioinformatics collect, process and analyze masses of data, or in computational biology, they simulate biological systems, metabolic pathways, the behavior of a cell or how a protein is built (Hey, Tansley &amp; Tolle, 2009). In clinical medicine, the end users are confronted with increased volumes of highly complex, noisy, high-dimensional, multivariate and often weakly- structured data (Holzinger, 2011c). The field of biomedical informatics concerns the information processing by both humans and computers, dealing with biomedical complexity (Patel, Kahol &amp; Buchman, 2011) to support decision making which is still a central topic in biomedical informatics (Shortliffe, 2011).

The combustion chamber should be constructed of nominal 4 in. (100 mm) thick brick. When refractory brick or firebrick are used, model building codes permit the total wall thickness to be reduced. Thin mortar joints, not more than 1/4 in.(6.4 mm), should be specified. A 1 in. (25 mm) air space should be provided between the combustion chamber wall and the backup wall, although not required by building codes. This air space provides for thermal expansion of the combustion chamber. A noncombustible, compressible, fibrous insulation or similar material should be wrapped around the combustion chamber to ensure that this air space is maintained. The backup wall should be no less than 4 in. (100 mm) in thickness around the back of the combustion chamber to support the loads from the smoke chamber and chimney above.

CAM specific to lung cancer has focused on therapeutic options that may have less systemic toxicity compared to current chemotherapy options such as Gemcitabine, Paclitaxel, and Etoposide. Herbal plants that have been used in lung cancer therapy include Platycodon grandiflorum (Campanulaceae), Morus alba (Moraceae), Prunus armeniaca (Rosaceae), Rhus verniciflua (Anacardiaceae), Perilla frutescens (Labiatae), Stemona japonica (Stemonaceae), Tusilago farfara (Compositae), and Draba nemorosa (Brassicaceae) [12]. Although these are used as alternative modes of therapy, it is more common for herbal remedies to be used as adjuvant modalities with chemotherapy [13]. The role of these herbal therapies is multifactorial. They can be used to reduce chemotherapy-induced toxicity, mitigate cancer-related symptoms, or directly increase anti- cancer effects [14]. A randomized control trial (RCT) of 61 patients evaluated the use of herbal medications as adjuvant therapy and showed an enhancement in median survival in the group that was treated with Sheng-mai and Gu- jin Granule along with Navelbine and Cisplatin [15]. This group had a 48.5% increase in survival compared to 32.2% in the control arm that only received the two chemotherapy drugs. Another study enrolled 232 non-small cell lung cancer patients and showed that Shenqi-fuzheng, an herbal injection similar to Sheng- mai, served as a useful adjuvant to chemotherapy by improving quality of life [16]. Similarly another RCT of 121 patients with advanced non- small cell lung cancer showed improved quality of life and a trend towards increase in survival time in patients assigned to Kangliuzengxiao and Feiyanning in addition to chemotherapy [17]. Fiji Recipe therapy has been shown to alleviate chemotherapy side effects and enhance therapeutic efficacy [18]. Similarly, other studies have demonstrated the benefits of CAM therapy in mitigating the adverse effects of chemotherapy, including myalgia and diarrhea [19,20]. A case report showed regression of small cell lung cancer with the use of Chinese herbal medicines [21]. Lastly, another case report

Figure 3 presents a cumulative view of total healthcare spending for cancer patients. Over the 47- month period following diagnosis, patients who we could track had average cumulative total healthcare costs of $101,000 for breast cancer, $165,000 for colorectal cancer, and $282,000 for lung cancer. The cumulative figures by month since diagnosis are represented in the left axis using solid lines. Patient OOP costs are shown as dashed lines using the right axis. Relative to total average spending of $101,000 to $282,000 for the 4 year period, the patient OOP of $7,500 to $11,000 suggests that ESI provides substantial protection to many patients. We note that patient contributions to premium would be in addition to the patient OOP costs. Premium contributions averaged approximately $1,100 per employee per year for single coverage, and over $5,000 for family coverage in 2016.20 Patients may face other costs not reflected in these data such as travel expenses and loss of income.

Radcliff et al. looked at patients who received opioids initially for treatment of lumbar disc herniation compared with those who did not. They found that those receiving opioids had a higher rate of surgery and that, overall, there was no significant difference four years later. Opioid medications were associated with an increased crossover to surgical treatment. Four years after the initiation of treatment, 16 percent of those who received opioids at the start were still on opioids, whereas only 5 percent of those who were treated with non-opioids initially were on opioids after four years. They concluded that those who were initially treated with opioids had a higher rate of surgery and a greater chance of being on opioids four years later but no significant change in overall outcome (Radcliff et al., 2013).

Pattern Matching. We developed a pattern- matching classifier as a baseline for our more so- phisticated classification methods. A list of all UMLS string representations for each of 45 codes (including synonyms from source vocabularies other than ICD-9-CM) was created as described in the MTI section above. The strings were then con- verted to lower case, punctuation was removed, and strings containing terms unlikely to be found in a clinical report were pruned. For example, Ab- domen NOS pain and Abdominal pain (finding) were reduced to abdominal pain. For the same rea- sons, some of the strings were relaxed into pat- terns. For example, it is unlikely to see PAIN CHEST in a chart, but very likely to find pain in chest. The string, therefore, was relaxed to the fol- lowing pattern: pain.*chest. The text of the clinical history and the impression fields of the radiology reports with negated expressions removed (see Section 2.2) was broken up into sentences. Each sentence was then searched for all available pat- terns. A corresponding code was assigned to the document for each matched pattern. This pattern matching achieved F-score = 0.79 on the training set. To reduce the number of codes assigned to a document, a check for allowed combinations was added as a post-processing step. The combination of assigned codes was looked up in the table of allowed codes. If not present, the codes were re- duced to the combination of assigned codes most frequently occurring in the training set. This brought the F-score up to 0.84 on the training data. As the performance of this classifier was compara- ble to other methods, we decided to include these results when combining the predictions of the other classifiers.

In cavity wall construction, the prescribed air space acts as an insulating layer in addition to the masonry units. Thermal performance of the system can be further enhanced by placing insulation materials in the cavity. Insulation materials used in brick masonry cavity walls include inorganic cellular materials such as perlite and vermiculite, and organic cellular materials such as polystyrene, polyurethane, polyisocyanurate and foams. These insulation types are manufactured in the form of rigid boards, granular fills and foams. Each of these types, if properly used, will result in a more thermally efficient wall system. Although the most important characteristic for insulation is its thermal resistance, other properties should be considered including water absorption, combustibility, density, insect resistance and ease of installation. The following criteria can be used for the selection of insulation materials for brick masonry cavity walls:

When total national direct costs of the fi rst year after diagnosis were calculated to include initial non- hormonal therapies, the cost of a 6-month maximum follow-up treatment and hormonal therapy, as well as the costs for patients who relapse within a year, the incidence total cost for the UK was estimated at £ 97 million in 2007, ≈ 0.12% of the UK ’ s annual spending on the NHS of that year [ 14,19 ] .

decreases the accuracy levels as shown in Table 9. The main reason is that it might just add redundant or even incorrect information for creating semantic structures due to limitations in the current co-reference identification module. Table 9 shows that the overall accuracy drops when including co-references, regardless of the feature set being used to construct the (2 vs. 2) SVM classifier .

1. Look carefully at the figures, diagrams and other illus- trations in the paper. Pay special attention to graphs. Are the axes properly labeled? Are results shown with error bars, so that conclusions are statistically sig- nificant? Common mistakes like these will separate rushed, shoddy work from the truly excellent.

The factors underlying these metrics merit closer atten- tion. The increased stringency of review of projects at the lead and preclinical candidate stages means that the quality of compounds is theoretically improving, so future success rates may be underestimated [112]. Of the 16 molecules entering preclinical development from the MMV portfolio since 2009, only four have been aban- doned, with six moving successfully to phase I, and a fur- ther seven working their way through safety studies, with four new phase I starts expected in 2017. As Fig. 3 with plots for Eq. 1 shows, doubling the success rate for indi- vidual candidate molecules (from 8 to 16%) more than halves the number that need to be evaluated. One area for possible improvement is the success rate in phase III,

Column notations: L1-- level 1 of the SVM, L2--level 2 of the SVM, L--linear kernel, P--polynomial kernel), R--RBF kernel, OA--overall accuracy, + (Positive), - (Negative), = (Neutral), !

and health-maintenance. Health is the natural state of the body, and the body possesses complex, homeo- static, self-regulatory mechanisms that it uses to heal itself from injury. In times of disease, when a part of the body is functioning sub-optimally, other parts of the body come out of their natural state of health in order to compensate for the dysfunction. During this compensatory process, however, new dysfunctions may arise. Osteopathic physicians must work to adjust the body so as to realign its parts back to normal. Osteopathic manipulative medicine aims to restore the body’s self-healing capacity by decreasing allo- static load, or the physiologic effects of chronic bodily stresses,1 and enhancing the immune system.

Clinically these agents are sometimes used off-label for their sedative effects. Among antihypertensives in wide use, the complaints of tiredness, fatigue and daytime sleepiness are commonly associated with drugs having antagonistic effects at the norepinephrine neuroreceptor (Dimsdale 1992). The complaints of tiredness, fatigue and daytime sleepiness (2–4.3%) associated with beta-blocker use may occur secondary to disturbed sleep or direct action of the drug. Beta-blocking drugs with vasodilating properties (e.g. carvedilol, labetalol) are also associated with reported fatigue and somnolence (3–11%). Sedation is among the most common side ef- fects reported for the alpha-2 agonists clonidine and methyldopa (30–75%) (AHFS 2003). Alpha-1 antagonists (e.g. terazosin, prazosin) are sometimes associated with transient sedation. Prazosin, a norepinephine antagonist, has demonstrated value in treating insomnia associated with PTSD nightmares (Raskind et al. 2003). Clonidine is sometimes utilized to treat the agitation and insomnia that result from using amphetamines to treat AD/HD in pediatric patients (Ming et al. 2011).

Free access to scientific articles increases readership (as measured by article downloads) and reaches a broader audience (as measured by unique IP addresses) but has no effect on article citations within the first 3 yr after publication. These results are consistent with earlier trial reports on the physiology literature (14, 15) and suggest that these claims are generalizable across the scientific, social sciences, and humanities literatures.

Open access articles were cited no more frequently than subscription-access articles. The estimate of cita- tion effect at 3 yr was (cid:3)1%, statistically indistinguish- able from 0 (ME 1.01; 95% CI, 0.95–1.08; P(cid:1)0.669; Table 2). Earlier citation estimates revealed similarly small, nonsignificant results (3% at 12 mo, 4% at 18 mo, 2% at 24 mo, and 2% at 30 mo). Figure 1 provides a visual comparison of results by subject category. In comparison, review articles, the number of au- thors, and page length were all significant predictors of article citations (Table 1). Articles that were self-ar- chived showed a positive effect on citations ((cid:3)11%), although this estimate was not significant (ME 1.11; 95% CI, 0.92–1.33; P (cid:1) 0.266). Just 65 articles (2%) in our data set were self-archived, however, limiting the statistical power of our test.

Pvivaxhas been widely identified in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and sporadic cases in other Asian countries. Many countries with both urban and rural malaria transmission may not have malaria risk in the most frequently visited major cities. †Equal efficacy; choice depends on traveller, itinerary, side-effects, individual choices, and convenience. ‡Tafenoquine and atovaquone can act also on the liver stage; doxycycline, azithromycin, and proguanil have limited activity in the liver stage. §Not recommended for travelling to Thailand borders with Cambodia and Burma due to mefloquine resistance. ||Need to check G6PD level before prescribing. Sometimes used as terminal prophylaxis in travellers with prolonged stays in countries with P vivaxor P ovale to eliminate the hypnozoite stage in the liver. ¶Primaquine has an effect on the liver-stage (primary schizont) of all four plasmodium species, and the sexual blood stages of all four species but only the asexual blood stages of P vivaxbut not Pfalciparum.

The basic concept of the course is that the students should learn from the real examples and on their own mistakes. In most of the cases, participants were analysing and correcting each-others work. In other cases, participants were making comments on examples prepared by Ian Cressie. Typical exercise was, for example: a short RA is given to students who have to write a missing abstract respecting the rules and functions of an abstract.

Risk information is presented in various sections of the approved labeling. The ADVERSE REACTIONS section is the repository for all adverse reactions associated with a drug. Depending on the seriousness or other important clinical implications of an adverse reaction, it may also be discussed in greater detail in other labeling sections, in particular the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and BOXED WARNING sections.14 For example, the ADVERSE REACTIONS section of approved human drug labeling is explicitly required to “describe the overall adverse reaction profile of the drug based on the entire safety database.”15 The threshold for inclusion of an adverse event16 in approved human drug labeling is a determination that “there is some basis to believe there is a causal relationship between the drug and the occurrence of the adverse event.”17 Whether there is some basis to believe there is a causal relationship is a matter of judgment based on factors such as: (1) the frequency of reporting of the event, (2) whether the adverse event rate for a drug exceeds the placebo rate, (3) the extent of dose-response, (4) the extent to which the adverse event is consistent with the pharmacology of the drug, (5) the timing of the event relative to the time of drug exposure, (6)

Misdiagnosis too frequently results in serious harm to patients. In a survey of physicians, 64% said that up to 10% of the misdiagnoses they have experienced directly resulted in harm to the patient6. Another study found that 28% of 538 reported diagnostic errors were life-threatening or resulted in the patient’s death or permanent disability.7
With the opening and flue sizes known, Equation 4 may be used to calculate the minimum chimney height to provide adequate draft in a properly designed, detailed and constructed assembly. The height calculated using Equation 4 is measured from the top of the fireplace opening, and is the minimum required to produce an adequate draft. Building code requirements previously discussed for minimum chimney heights are based solely on fire safety considerations and must always be met or exceeded.

The rising cost of health care (Saxe et al., 2008), coupled with multiple unmet needs, equates to multiple CAM uses (Mao et al., 2008). These unmet needs were identified by Mao et al. (2008) as emotional, physical, nutritional, financial, informational, treatment- and employment-related, and daily living activi- ties. Other reasons included an identified dissatisfaction with conventional care (Richardson et al., 2000; Saxe et al., 2008), fragmentation of care into survivorship, lack of empathy and support, or if a survivor’s subsequent needs were unfulfilled (Mao et al., 2008). In addition, Carpenter et al. (2008) identi- fied decreased emotional function and multiple medical issues in very long-term breast cancer survivors who used CAM. The potential for recurrence and high levels of worry (Mao et al., 2008) and distress (Lawsin et al., 2007) also were reported with increased use. Finally, the use of herbal supplements were reportedly used to reduce the side effects of treatment and to boost immune function (Buettner et al., 2006; Deng et al., 2004; Lawsin et al., 2007; Richardson et al., 2000; Saxe et al., 2008).

Table 1 shows the results of our approach using the CUI and ST de(cid:2)nitions as context for the possi- ble concepts on the NLM-WSD dataset and Table 4 shows similar results using the con(cid:3)ate dataset. On the NLM-WSD dataset, the results show a large difference in accuracy between the contexts on a word by word basis making it dif(cid:2)cult to deter- mine which of the context description performs the best. The unigram results show that CUI→ST and CUI+ST obtain the highest accuracy for (cid:2)ve words, and CUI and ST obtain the highest accuracy for one word. The bigram results show that CUI→ST and CUI obtains the highest accuracy for two words, ST obtains the highest accuracy for four words, and CUI+ST obtains the highest accuracy for one word. The overall results show that using unigrams with

Preparing students to be able to think critically is one of the key goals for many professionals in higher education, and it is also a quality sought by most employers of university graduates (Sulaiman, Rahman, &amp; Dzulkifli, 2008). Under a Thailand 4.0 vision, critical thinking skills are stated to be a key pillar among the goals for a new, knowledge-based economy (Jones &amp; Pimdee, 2017). These skills, however, are limited, as according to a recent study evaluating logical thinking and analytical skills, of 6,235 students in ten Thai provinces, the average final score was just 36.5%, with only 2.09% passing the exam (Rujivanarom, 2016). Over 2,500 years ago Plato in his discussions of logic indicated that critical thinking is the tool that helps individuals find answers or solutions to a person’s confusions and problems (Thayer-Bacon, 1998). Socrates, Plato’s teacher, believed that discussion and critical thinking with knowledge reside in the mind of the individual, rather than a teacher transmitting knowledge to a student (Ornstein &amp; Levine, 2006). Nearly 2,500 years later, scholars and educators are still discussing the mechanisms, importance, and outcomes of critical thinking skills (or lack thereof). Contemporary evidence of the importance of critical thinking skills for employment has been provided from the National Association of Colleges and Employers [NACE] (2016) which indicated that critical thinking/problem-solving skills were ranked most important by the 144 surveyed employers (Table 1). This is also consistent with the research results obtained by Bassham, Irwin, Nardone, and Wallace (2013) which indicated that college education is responsible for the development of critical thinking skills which, in their turn, lead to higher-order thinking. This is also consistent with (Costa &amp; Kallick, 2014) who stated that critical thinking skills are consistently included in all the lists of essentials behind college and career readiness (Kraisuth &amp; Panjakajornsak, 2017).

The subpoena seeks a student’s academic records, which are covered by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, 20 U.S.C. §1232g (“FERPA”). Pursuant to FERPA, the College is unable to release educational records to you without first providing notice of the subpoenas to the student. The College has sent a letter to inform the student of this request and will provide him/her with time to notify it of whether he/she will seek to quash the subpoena. If the student indicates that he/she does not wish to quash the subpoena, or if he/she does not respond, the College will release the records to you at that time.

•Representante Legal: É aquele que por lei ou declaração judicial está autorizado a contrair direitos e obrigações em nome de um terceiro. De acordo com o Código Civil Brasileiro Art. 1.690, compete aos pais, e na falta de um deles ao outro, com exclusividade, representar os filhos menores de dezesseis anos, bem como assis�-los até a maioridade (com o falecimento dos pais, ou sendo estes julgados ausentes, ou em caso de os pais decaírem do poder familiar, compe�rá ao tutor legal representar o menor até os dezesseis anos e assis�-lo após essa idade - Código Civil Brasileiro Art. 1.747). Dessa maneira, no caso de um paciente menor, caso este seja menor de 16 anos, apenas o representante deverá assinar este termo (“representação”). Já, caso o paciente seja maior de 16 e menor de 18, tanto o representante legal, quanto o paciente, deverão assinar este termo (“assistência”). •Em casos de pacientes maiores de idade, mas que não possam por causa transitória ou permanente manifestar sua vontade, de acordo com o Código Civil Brasilei- ro, estas pessoas devem ser representadas por seu curador, nos termos da lei civil (art. 1767, I, CC).

of the introductions contain a single move: BESP1 only contains Move 1 whereas BESP3 and BESP8 only contain Move 3. None of them follow a strict M1–M2–M3 sequence. The only sequence that is repeated is M1–M3, which occurs four times. In summary, RAIs in The ESPecialist do not seem to follow a pattern in the organization of their rhetorical moves although there seems to be a preference for the M1–M3 type. In this type of structural organization, the authors establish a territory (by making topic generalizations and giving background information, for example) and then present their current study (by announcing the present research and indicating the structure of the article, for example). The ESPj RAIs, on the other hand, follow the pattern proposed by the CARS model more closely. Three of them follow the M1–M2–M3 sequence strictly while five others (i.e., ESPj3, ESPj5, ESPj7, ESPj8 and ESPj9) contain this sequence plus a repetition of one or more moves. Among these, ESPj5, ESPj7 and ESPj8 show very little variation from the canonical sequence: ESPj5 contains a one-sentence Move 1 between a 7-sentence Move 2 and a 7-sentence Move 3 while ESPj7 and ESPj8 each contain two instances of Move 2, establishing the niche in two separate installments. With the exception of ESPj2, all the RAIs in this corpus contain a Move 2, and there was only one instance (i.e., ESPj1) of Move 3-fronting. ESPj1 did not contain a Move 1 either, being, overall, the introduction that was the most dissimilar from the model.

Unfortunately, and contrary to increasing medical evidence that religious services without safeguards have caused serious outbreaks in many other cities and counties throughout the country, the Archdiocese has conducted both indoor and outdoor gatherings over the past three weekends that violate the Health Order and jeopardize the health and safety of San Franciscans. These large gatherings of people indoors for a long period, in some instances reported without face coverings and with singing, place clergy, staff, volunteers and congregants alike at heightened risk of transmission of COVID-19, which can lead to serious illness and even death, and endangers the health of the Archdiocese’s parishioners and the entire community. Given the recent rise in cases and hospitalizations, Dr. Aragón’s concerns about these risks have only been heightened.

Since stacking produced the best F-score on the training corpus and is known to be more robust than the individual classifiers, the corresponding results for the test corpus were submitted to the Challenge submission website. The stacking results for the test corpus achieved an F-score of 0.85 and a secondary, cost-sensitive accuracy score of 0.83. For comparison purposes, 44 Challenge submis- sions had a mean F-score of 0.77 with a maximum of 0.89. Our F-score of 0.85 falls between the 70th and 75th percentiles.

Clear water repellents, silicone and acrylic coatings are among the solutions often sug- gested for preventing efflorescence. A coating may prevent efflorescence from recurring by reducing the amount of water absorbed by an exposed masonry surface. However, applying a coating to brickwork that has a tendency to effloresce, without stopping the mechanisms causing that efflorescence, may lead to deg- radation of the masonry. Further, applying a coating that inhibits evaporation of water from the masonry may also lead to degradation.

Information Management Systems, Inc. Oncology Analyzer database, survival data, expert opinion, data from the literature, and unit costs from various published offi cial sources. Costs were infl ated to 2006 rates using consumer price indexes (France, Germany, Italy and Spain) or a health infl ation index (UK). The initial treatment costs per patient, which included the cost of biopsy and subsequent surgical or non- surgical treatment, were € 3171 in the UK, € 4057 in Germany, € 5851 in France, € 5226 in Italy and € 3256 in Spain ( Fig. 1 ). Surgery accounted for the largest proportion of initial treatment costs in most countries, with the exception of the UK, where radiotherapy accounted for a greater percentage ( Fig. 1 ). Costs of treatment over 1 year were calculated for all patients, regardless of whether they were treated, and included the unit costs of treatment, relapse costs and average monthly follow-up costs. The total costs for all diagnosed patients in the fi rst year after diagnosis were € 116.7 million (UK), € 179 million (Germany), € 167.5 million (France), € 106.7 million (Italy) and € 114.6 million (Spain). In comparison, a recent study in Italy by Lazzaro et al . [ 13 ] also looked at the fi rst-year costs of prostate cancer in 2000. The estimated cost per patient in Italy was € 6600, which is higher than the value estimated in the Fourcade publication [ 14 ] . The difference in values is probably attributable to lower rates of radiation treatment and a higher use of hormonal treatment in the Lazzaro study, in which

In the last few years there has been more research devoted to CAM. However, there still remain many obstacles for CAM to be integrated into cancer treatment, especially lung cancer. The lack of resources (plants) to produce these herbal remedies could result in inadequate supply for the potentially high demand. The technology required for plant extraction and mixture preparation is another hurdle in establishing an adequate supply. Another obstacle is the lack of

Wood floor joists normally have a 3 in. (75 mm) fire cut end and bear only on the interior wythe of a cavity wall. The ends of the joist must not project into the cavity; they can form a ledge, which may create a moisture bridge across the cavity. Wood floor joists may also be fastened to metal joist hangers attached to a ledger bolted to the inner wythe of the cavity wall, or joist hangers may be embedded in the inner wythe of the cavity wall. See Fig. 23.

The design of cavity walls is governed by model building codes. Most of these reference the ACI 530/ASCE 5/TMS 402 Building Code Requirements for Masonry Structures, also known as the Masonry Standards Joint Committee (MSJC) Code [2]. The Uniform Building Code incorporates similar design requirements for cavity walls [9]. Seismic design requirements are also stipulated in these building codes based on site location. A detailed design of cavity walls is not covered in this Technical Notes. For design aids and examples of design procedures, several books listed in the REFERENCES section should be consulted [5, 7].

With regard to beta blockers in substance abuse, atenolol has been shown in placebo-controlled trials to be beneficial in alcohol withdrawal [54-56]. Pindolol has been used to treat alcohol withdrawal [57]. Timolol had a minimal effect on a subset of symptoms of patients experiencing alcohol withdrawal [58].With regard to cocaine abuse, propranolol has been used to treat withdrawal and overdoses [59, 60]. Note that propranolol has also been shown to suppress tremors [61], consistent with one of the perceived benefits of beta blockers in performance anxiety in musicians (above).

Guidance         for   Industry
Throughout the history of medicine, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has played a significant role in the treatment of cancer patients. In 1999, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) created the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) in recognition of this growing field. Research funding to the NCCAM has risen from $ 2 million in 1992 to $50 million by 2000 and is expected to be more than $110 million by the mid-2000’s [1]. A survey conducted in 2005 indicated that approximately 35.9% of cancer patients attempted use of CAM during their treatment course [2]. In fact, that percentage may be even higher as studies have shown that many patients do not disclose the use of CAM therapy unless asked specifically [3]. Physicians poorly communicate with their patients regarding the potential benefits or harms of CAM because they have minimal understanding of CAM therapy and its physiological role in managing diseases [4,5]. Patients are often dissatisfied with their physicians’ lack of knowledge regarding CAM therapy [6]. Patients who have a history of incorporating CAM into their management plan are generally driven by personal beliefs and principles regarding life and health [7]. An increased use of CAM has been seen in patients with increased psychosocial stress or poor prognosis at initial diagnosis [8,9]. Additionally, females and younger patients have a higher predilection for using CAM therapy [10]. There are numerous modalities of CAM such as spiritual healing or prayer, herbal medicine, and chiropractics [11]. This review focuses on medicinal therapies used as CAM for patients suffering from malignancy, specifically lung cancer.

also allow one to distinguish different parasite erythro- cytic stages.This relatively simple assay provides quite high throughput and has replaced older methods at some centres,but requires expensive equipment. Compounds that meet an acceptable cut-off for in vitroactivity (for example,IC 50≤1 µM) can then be tested for activity against a range ofgeographically dis- tinct P.falciparum lines of differing drug-resistance phenotypes (see Further Information,Antimalarial drug discovery:efficacy models for compound screening) to determine whether resistance to existing antimalarial drugs reduces parasite sensitivity to the compounds under evaluation. Different research groups have incorporated a variety of modifications of the basic in vitro screens listed above,which can influence the measurement of drug activity levels,as follows.

is worth noting that these two long RAIs, as well as the longest introduction in the BESP subcorpus (i.e., BESP5, with 928 words), contained the whole literature review. The only other introduction that also exhausted the literature review was ESPj5. Besides a higher average number of words per RAI, the ESPj subcorpus also had a higher average number of sentences per RAI. The number of paragraphs, however, was smaller in this subcorpus than in the BESP subcorpus. In fact, three of the 10 ESPj introductions only had one paragraph, whereas BESP introductions required at least two. The ratio between the number of sentences and paragraphs shows that eight out of the 10 BESP introductions had fewer than three sentences per paragraph while, in the ESPj corpus, three was the minimum found and the average was 5.2.

Cancer patients were identified as individuals with cancer ICD-9 codes in any position on qualified claims, which are described in the table below. Patients were required to have a cancer ICD-9 code on one inpatient, or one observation, or two or more non-acute inpatient, outpatient, emergency department, or evaluation and management services that occur within 90 days of each other, and where the first of the two services (but not necessarily both) was incurred in 2011. Qualified claims were identified by the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) or Revenue codes below:

In 2010 the German government passed the Pharmaceutical Market Restructuring Act, or Arzneimittelmarkt- Neuordnungsgesetz (AMNOG), to regulate drug prices. AMNOG went into effect in 2011, and the legal process attempts to balance paying for innovative drug development with making decisions based on clinical efficacy.

When the mechanisms causing the efflorescing salts to appear have been established and the sources of salts or moisture are identified (usually the latter), suitable corrections must be addressed. Solutions to efflorescence prob- lems usually involve reducing water penetration into the masonry and removing the efflorescence from the wall. Recommendations for the correction of water penetration in masonry walls are contained in Technical Note 46.

To determine if there were possible changes in participants’ ratings before and after the workshop, paired t-tests were run and analyzed. Table 2 shows mean scores and standard deviations (SDs) from the Pre-Workshop Student Survey and the Post-Workshop Student Survey, mean score differences and standard errors (SEs), dependent-samples t-tests results (t statistic and degrees of freedom), p-values, and the effect sizes (measured by dependent-samples Cohen’s d).

News media are an important source of scientific informa- tion for the public in domains such as health, medicine, and climate change research, making the accurate communica- tion of findings – and patterns of misinformation – a vi- tal issue for society and public policy (Geller, Bernhardt, and Holtzman 2002; Boykoff and Boykoff 2004; Brechman, Lee, and Cappella 2009). A substantial amount of scholarly attention has been devoted to studying the mechanisms by which academic research findings move along and through a chain of translation-oriented intermediaries, from journals anduniversitycommunicationsofficestoreportersandblog- gers and finally to citizen groups and individual members of the public. Journalists’ internal processes of selection and framing news are very significant, as they are an antecedent and structural factor that affects all subsequent issues of public attention. Because parsing and interpreting the methods and results of highly technical scientific papers is a difficult task, journalists may use simple heuristics to determine whether research is novel and of high quality and impact, such as inspecting the name of the journal and the article subjects. An even simpler explanation is that journalists may publish Copyright c (cid:13) 2018, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.

For slow acting drugs, additional smears should be taken on day 5 and day 6, the parasitemia determined and the activity calculated. Untreated control mice typically will die approximately one week after infection. For treated mice the survival-time (in days) is recorded and the mean survival time is calculated in comparison to untreated and standard drug treated groups. Mice still without parasitaemia on day 30 post-infection are considered cured. Observations concerning adverse effects due to the drug, including weight loss, are recorded.

Reinforced brick masonry (RBM) lintels may be built in place or prefabricated. The advantages of using RBM lintels are numerous, but include more efficient use of materials and exposed brick rather than steel at the top of the opening. RBM lintel design procedures are given in Technical Notes 17H. Loose steel angle lintels are the most prevalent means of support. For this reason, Table 1 gives recommended steel angle dimensions. If opening sizes other than those listed in Table 1 are used, information found in Technical Notes 31B Revised can be used for design of the loose steel angle lintel.
