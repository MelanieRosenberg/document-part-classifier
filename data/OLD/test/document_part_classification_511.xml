Introduction
</SECTION_HEADER>
<TEXT>
Medical misdiagnosis, in the form of inaccurate, late, and delayed diagnoses, is an ongoing problem in the U.S. Not only do these diagnostic errors present an ongoing risk to the health and safety of patients, but they also cost the economy billions of dollars.

<TEXT>
This paper summarizes the key research findings on the frequency, human cost, and financial impact of these diagnostic errors, while providing new data on the value of second opinions. An extensive Institute of Medicine (IOM) report underscores the importance of this with its conclusion that most Americans will receive an inaccurate or late diagnosis at least once in their lives, often with life-threatening consequences.

How Significant a Problem Is Misdiagnosis?
</SECTION_HEADER>
<TEXT>
Misdiagnosis is the subject of a growing number of studies. The most recent one, Improving Diagnosis in Healthcare from the Institute of Medicine (IOM), explores the findings of many of these studies and notes that each year, approximately 12 million people in the U.S. who seek outpatient medical care experience some form of diagnostic error1. Another Johns Hopkins study found that out of 6,000 cases from medical institutions across the country, one out of every 71 cancer cases was misdiagnosed and up to one out of five cancers were misclassified, errors which can result in delayed or inappropriate treatment.2

The Human Cost

Misdiagnosis too frequently results in serious harm to patients. In a survey of physicians, 64% said that up to 10% of the misdiagnoses they have experienced directly resulted in harm to the patient6. Another study found that 28% of 538 reported diagnostic errors were life-threatening or resulted in the patientâ€™s death or permanent disability.7

Since effective treatment depends upon an accurate and effective diagnosis, misdiagnosis can also lead to inappropriate or unnecessary testing, such as biopsies and treatment that may cause harm. A study by the Rand Corporation discovered that 30% of common surgical procedures, including coronary artery bypass graft surgery, were provided for reasons that were not supported by clinical studies and/or evidence-based treatment guidelines and may have resulted in complications or harm to the patients.8

The IOM report supports these findings, stating that diagnostic errors contribute to 10% of patient deaths and 6-17% of hospital adverse events. Other researchers quantify the human cost of diagnostic errors at between 40,000 and 80,000 deaths per year.9 These troubling findings make developing effective methods to prevent diagnostic errors an urgent priority.
