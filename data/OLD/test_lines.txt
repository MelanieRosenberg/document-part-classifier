For slow acting drugs, additional smears should be taken on day 5 and day 6, the parasitemia determined and the activity calculated. Untreated control mice typically will die approximately one week after infection. For treated mice the survival-time (in days) is recorded and the mean survival time is calculated in comparison to untreated and standard drug treated groups. Mice still without parasitaemia on day 30 post-infection are considered cured. Observations concerning adverse effects due to the drug, including weight loss, are recorded.

There are many, often complicated, mechanisms of efflorescence. Simply stated, efflorescence occurs when water containing dissolved salts is brought to the surface of masonry, the water evaporates and the salts are left on the surface of the masonry. The salt solutions may migrate across surfaces of masonry units, between the mortar and units, or through the pores of the mortar or units.

also allow one to distinguish different parasite erythro- cytic stages.This relatively simple assay provides quite high throughput and has replaced older methods at some centres,but requires expensive equipment. Compounds that meet an acceptable cut-off for in vitroactivity (for example,IC 50≤1 µM) can then be tested for activity against a range ofgeographically dis- tinct P.falciparum lines of differing drug-resistance phenotypes (see Further Information,Antimalarial drug discovery:efficacy models for compound screening) to determine whether resistance to existing antimalarial drugs reduces parasite sensitivity to the compounds under evaluation. Different research groups have incorporated a variety of modifications of the basic in vitro screens listed above,which can influence the measurement of drug activity levels,as follows.

In the absence of financial support from governments, the treatment costs presented in Table 4.3 would not be affordable to individual patients. For example, a course of standard (adjuvant) treatment for early stage HER2 positive breast cancer (Adjuvant AC-TH) would cost about 10 years of average annual wages in India and South Africa, and 1.7 years in the USAxx. Patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in India, South Africa and the USA would require, respectively, 3.7 years, 5.6 years and 1.1 years of wages to cover for the costs of a

Return-to-sport progressions should be individualised based on the injury, athlete’s age, history and level of play, and the ability to provide close supervision during the return to activity, and progressions may vary between athletes. Each stage is generally 24 hours without return of concussion symptoms. Consider written clearance from a healthcare professional before return to sport as directed by local laws and regulations.3

Brick has been used to create beautiful buildings for centuries. Most of these structures have a substantial history of outstanding performance. In some instances the appearance is affected by the development of efflorescence or stains. These may originate from materials in the brick or mortar, from adjacent materials, and from outside sourc- es such as cleaning agents. Each has a particular chemical composition and a unique means of removal.

twice, for the hundreds of medicines developed at least with partial support from public resources (340). This raises an important question: does the public have the right to expect governments to play a greater role in exercising more stringent pricing regulations, or simply, by imposing lower prices for cancer medicines in order to realize a more direct financial return for public investment on behalf of the tax-payers? Another pertinent question is whether the ongoing push by research outputs from publicly-funded universities have tilted the pharmaceutical industry at the expense of the tax-payers (342). relationship between the government, industry and university (343).

In 2019, the MDH Public Health Laboratory (MDH-PHL) implemented a multiplex real-time PCR that detects three CRAB-specific carbapenemase genes (OXA-23, OXA-24, and OXA-58). The MDH-PHL currently tests all CRAB isolates received through sentinel surveillance for OXA-23, OXA-24, and OXA-58, along with five other carbapenemase genes (KPC, NDM, OXA-48, IMP, and VIM). Approximately 20% of the CRAB isolates tested from Minnesota facilities are carbapenemase-producing (CP), with the majority producing OXA-23 or OXA-24. Rapid identification of CP-CRAB and immediate implementation of infection control measures are key to controlling transmission in health care facilities.

The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) initiated population-based sentinel surveillance for CRAB in Hennepin and Ramsey counties in 2011. This letter is to inform you that MDH will be expanding surveillance to include statewide reporting of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), beginning March 1, 2020. MDH will be conducting this surveillance pursuant to Minnesota Rules 4605.7000 to 4605.7900. Specifically, Minnesota Rules, 4605.7080, permits the Commissioner of Health to require reporting of newly recognized or emerging diseases and syndromes suspected to be of infectious origin or previously controlled or eradicated infectious disease if certain criteria are met. Documentation on the approved proposal for this change as well as details on CRAB reporting and information for laboratories is available at Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) (https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/crab/index.html).

whole, and are more forgiving in the sense that they accept grade replacement for repeated courses. They are less likely to place as much emphasis on Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) scores and/or GPAs as allopathic schools do.12 These differing criteria may explain some of the existing disparities in average admissions statis- tics between admitted students of osteopathic med- ical schools and those of allopathic medical schools. The 19,517 matriculating allopathic students in 2012 had an average combined MCAT score of 31.2 (Physical Science: 10.5, Verbal Reasoning: 9.8, Biological Science: 10.9) and average GPAs of 3.63, 3.75, and 3.68 for science, non- science, and total, respectively.15 In contrast, the same year, the 5,464 matriculating osteopathic medical students had an average MCAT score of 26.85 (PS: 8.74, VR: 8.63, BS: 9.48) with average science, non-science, and total GPAs of 3.37, 3.59, and 3.49, respectively.16 The other major factor contributing to this disparity is the difference in the actual applicant pools. Currently, the majority of medical school applicants do not apply to osteopathic medical programs, likely due to a general lack of accessible and reliable information concerning osteo- pathic medicine. Many applicants have not had any signif-

islation. The following year, the California State Supreme Court overturned the merger legislation from over a decade prior, thus allowing the reinstatement of an osteo- pathic licensing board, a medical society, and a new school, now known as Western University of Health Sci- ences College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific. How- ever, the emergence of government-sponsored insurance and managed care programs brought about new chal- lenges for the osteopathic profession. DOs were histori- cally severely underrepresented in the decisions regarding Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement for osteopathic medical services. In fact, it was not until 1995 that the first DO was named to serve on the Physician Payment Review Commission, which advised Congress on policy con- cerning such reimbursements. Today, numerous issues, including physician reim- bursement, still surround osteopathic medicine. The most pertinent of these concerns are internship and resi- dency shortages, public awareness and perception, clinical research on OMM, DO-MD relations, and the effort to dis- tinguish DOs from MDs in light of the progressive blurring of distinctions between the two professions. All of these issues are quite complex and are further elaborated on later in this guidebook. 24% Average growth every 5 years in # of DOs since 1985

a physician intentionally stimulates a physiologic response by CO 2 inhalation [31], sodium lactate infusion [32,33], or cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK-4) injection [32,34]. These chemical exposures are used as potent tools to design controlled studies with predictable levels of PA episodes. In a study with healthy volunteer subjects using carbon dioxide inhalation to provoke panic and anxiety, propranolol significantly decreased heart rate, a cardiovascular somatic symptom, but did not provide psychic anxiolytic benefit [35].

Bandolier Bandolier is an independent organization in Europe that produces reports on evidence-based medicine. In 2003, Bandolier issued a report on the treatment of acute pain. Its evaluation compared many studies and concluded that the opioid medications were no more effective than the NSAIDs (Bandolier, 2003). In 2007, Bandolier produced a table comparing the efficacy of many different oral and injectable medications for pain. The below excerpt from that table shows the relative strengths of some commonly used medications. Notice that an injection of 10 mg of morphine is roughly equivalent to an oral dose of OTC ibuprofen.

SINCE 2001, ALL state licensing boards have accepted the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensure Exam- ination of the United States (COMLEX-USA), which is produced by the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners (NBOME). The United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE), produced by the National Board of Med- ical Examiners (NMBE), is the licensing exam that all allo- pathic medical students are required to take. Both are comprised of three tests, called “steps” by the USMLE and “levels” by the COMLEX, which must be passed for a phy- sician to gain unlimited licensure to practice medicine in the United States. According to 2013 USMLE Performance Data pub- lished in the 2013 NBME Annual Report, 97 percent of MD students (N=19,108), 94 percent of DO students (N=2,680), and 79 percent of foreign medical students and gradu- ates (N=14,649) passed the USMLE Step 1 exam on their first attempt. The pass rates for the USMLE Step 2 exam (from 2012-2013) showed narrowing between the groups: 98 percent (N=18,658), 96 percent (N=1,615), and 84 per- cent (N=12,203), respectively.22 The reason only a minority of DO students elect to take the USMLE is because it is optional and not required for their licensure. Osteopathic medical students may elect to take the USMLE based on a variety of reasons, including the desire to pursue an allopathic residency program. Osteopathic medical students are unique in that they have the option to apply for osteopathic (AOA) residency programs, allo- pathic (ACGME) residency programs, dual-accredited pro- grams, or both AOA and ACGME programs. However, all osteopathic students are required to take the COMLEX, regardless of whether or not they elect to take the USMLE. Thus, those who do take the USMLE must take both exams, which slightly differ in their length, emphasis, and ques- tion type, although they cover similar material apart from OMM.

Any proposed automated medical diagnosis system, which is constructed using data mining methodology, will help the doctors to diagnose the correct disease in less time [33]. Table:1 highlights a few of such system’s leading objectives along with their associated authors working in the field of predicting medical disease(s) using data mining technique. Common data mining techniques which are used in almost all the sectors are listed as: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Artificial neural network (ANN), K- nearest neighborhood (KNN), Support vector machine (SVM) etc. In order to improve the success of healthcare organization and health of the patients, the knowledge gained by data mining can be exercised for booming research problems in the associated arena [33].

Osteopathic medical schools also use differing cri- teria when selecting candidates to interview and/or extending offers of admission. For example, in the eval- uation of applicants, osteopathic medical schools place more emphasis on candidates’ interest in and knowledge of osteopathic philosophy. They also are more likely to seek out students who are interested in pursuing careers in primary care and in rural or underserved areas.3 Osteo- pathic admissions programs often view the candidate as a

Insomnia occurs in individuals of all ages and races, and has been observed across all cultures and countries.8,9 The actual prevalence of insomnia varies according to the stringency of the definition used. Insomnia symptoms occur in approximately 33% to 50% of the adult population; insomnia symptoms with dis- tress or impairment (i.e., general insomnia disorder) in 10% to 15%; and specific insomnia disorders in 5% to 10%.10 Consis- tent risk factors for insomnia include increasing age, female sex, comorbid (medical, psychiatric, sleep, and substance use) disor- ders, shift work, and possibly unemployment and lower socio- economic status. Patients with comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions are at particularly increased risk, with psychiatric and chronic pain disorders having insomnia rates as high as 50% to 75%.11-13 The risk relationship between insomnia and psychiatric disorders appears to be bidirectional; several studies have also

Value-based pricing or value pricing aims to determine the prices of medicines according to the value or worth that patients and health systems attribute to the medicines. In theory, by linking price to value, value- based approaches are more likely to encourage companies to innovate and produce medicines with attributes that society and governments value most. In the context of medicines this would mean the public and government would be willing to pay for medicines that improve health conditions and minimize harms.

Similar to the ranking experiments, we repeat the matched sample experiment on the subset of articles which received a press release. We find 3,398 matched pairs and confirm that the positive and negative instances do not have dispro- portionate skew towards any one outlet. Using all features, logistic regression achieves an F1 of 0.5794. Table 7 lists the top features for these results. Top negative features ap- pear to be those related to more technical scientific work, such as “proteins” and “genes” “expression”, while positive features are related to health, such as “fat,” “screening,” and “Project HOPE,” a publisher of health policy articles. Sur- prisingly, the American Chemical Society is a positive fea- ture and “medicine” is a negative feature when occurring in the title.

Composite or combination flashings are typically less expensive than sheet metal and are easier to install. The most predominant type is a thin layer of metal sandwiched between one or two layers of another material. The metal layer is usually of aluminum, copper or lead. It is covered on one or both sides with various materials, such as asphalt coatings, kraft paper, fiberglass fabric or plastic films. Product literature should be reviewed to determine whether these materials are appropriate for use in brick masonry cavity walls. Consideration should be given to compatibility with adjacent sealants, delamination due to moisture penetration and movement of the wall system.

The rise is thought to be partly due to increased detection because of more sensitive diagnostic procedures, resulting in some overdiagno- ses of papillary thyroid cancers.135 However, observed increases in rates of follicular thyroid cancer, as well as increases across tumor size and stages, may be associated with the rise in risk factors such as obesity.136-138

Producing competent primary care physicians, in par- ticular, is part of the mission statement of many, if not all, U.S. osteopathic medical schools. According to the 2014 U.S. News and World Report, a popular source of medical school rankings, osteopathic medical schools rank among the top producers of primary care doctors in the nation, with Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine (MSUCOM) being one of the ten top-ranked medical school in this category.13 Consequently, some cur- ricula may place a greater emphasis on such skills as bed- side manner, interviewing and building the physician- patient relationship. These schools do not in any way force students to go into primary care – many students simply choose to do so.14

Assessing  the  degree  of  applying  mathematics
Abstract: Biomedical Informatics can be defined as “the interdisciplinary field that studies and pursues the effective use of biomedical data, information and knowledge for scientific inquiry, problem solving, and decision making, motivated by efforts to improve human health.” However, professionals in the life sciences are facing an increasing quantity of highly complex, multi-dimensional and weakly structured data. While researchers in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) have for long been working independently to develop methods that can support expert end users to identify, extract and understand information out of this data, it is obvious that an interdisciplinary approach to bring these two fields closer together can yield synergies in the application of these methods to weakly structured complex medical data sets. The aim is to support end users to learn how to interactively analyse information properties and to visualize the most relevant parts – in order to gain knowledge, and finally wisdom, to support a smarter decision making. The danger is not only to get overwhelmed by increasing masses of data, moreover, there is the risk of modelling artifacts.

When analyzing the data, we found that there does not exist a CUI de(cid:2)nition for a large number of pos- sible concepts. Table 5 shows the number of words in the CUI and ST de(cid:2)nitions for each concept in the NLM-WSD dataset. Only four target words have a CUI de(cid:2)nition for each possible concept. We also found the concept de(cid:2)nitions vary widely in length. The CUI de(cid:2)nitions in the UMLS come from a va- riety of sources and there may exist more than one de(cid:2)nition per source. Unlike CUI de(cid:2)nitions, there does exist an ST de(cid:2)nition for each possible con- cept. The ST de(cid:2)nitions come from the same source and are approximately the same length but they are a broad categorization. We believe this makes them too coarse grained to provide descriptive enough in- formation about their associated concepts.

prices of single-brand medicines listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits after 5 years 10 years and 15 years of listing, respectively (203). This presumably would ensure companies not accruing excessive returns for medicines with long periods of exclusivity. It might also incentivize the companies to work with clinicians for faster adoption of the medicines in clinical practice so as to maintain its profitability through increased volume.

changes in clinical status. Reassessments might be per- formed less frequently for patients with more stable pain (eg, patients who have exhibited good pain con- trol without side effects after 24 hours of stable ther- apy). Pain reassessments might be useful at the time of nursing shift changes or with new caregivers to establish a baseline and promote continuity of care, although evidence showing that routine reassessment of pain at nursing shift changes is associated with improved clinical outcomes is not available.
In the previous experiments, we treat articles with news cov- erage from only automatic copying of abstracts or press re- leases as having coverage count 0. In this section, we also explore the binary prediction problem of differentiating be- tween those 0 count articles and those with any amount of real news coverage. We create a matched sampling problem using the 34,329 scientific articles with no real news cov- erage as negative examples. For each negative example, we attempt to find a positive example: 1. with the same subject fields, 2. published in the same journal, 3. published within

The randomised block design provides a means to break down an experiment into smaller parts, which can be handled more conveniently. In most cases, it will increase the precision at no extra cost, apart from the need for a slightly more-complex statistical analysis.

Considering these facts, some stakeholders have questioned whether pharmaceutical companies could claim to recover the full costs of R&D through setting high prices for medicines (340,341). More directly, these stakeholders are seeking clarity as to whether the public has been “paying twice”, or should be paying

4. Protect adjacent materials and nearby plants. Mask or otherwise protect windows, doors, and materials such as sealants, metal, glass, wood, limestone, cast stone, concrete masonry and ornamental trim from cleaning solutions. Cleaning chemicals may also damage plants and grass. It may be necessary to pre- vent the cleaning solution and run-off from contacting plants or the surrounding soil. 5. Saturate the area to be cleaned. Flush with water from the top down. Saturated brick masonry will not absorb the cleaning solution or dissolved mortar particles. Areas below the area being cleaned should also be saturated and kept wet until after the final rinse to prevent streaking and absorption of the run-off from above.

The prevailing models of emergency medical transport used in North America and Western Europe are quite costly and would be impractical for most low-income countries. Severe resource constraints, the poor condition of roads or trails, and a lack of fuel may dictate the utilization of a wider range of options. In the United Republic of Tanzania, for example, modes of emergency transportation include motor- boats, canoes, bicycles with trailers, tricycles with platforms, tractors with trailers, reconditioned vehicles, and ox carts (22).

Since effective treatment depends upon an accurate and effective diagnosis, misdiagnosis can also lead to inappropriate or unnecessary testing, such as biopsies and treatment that may cause harm. A study by the Rand Corporation discovered that 30% of common surgical procedures, including coronary artery bypass graft surgery, were provided for reasons that were not supported by clinical studies and/or evidence-based treatment guidelines and may have resulted in complications or harm to the patients.8

The TSST method has been used to study the effects of oral propranolol in volunteer subjects [25-28]. The assessments of psychic anxiety can be assessed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) or other similar tools [29,30]. The somatic and psychic effects of oral propranolol were tested using the TSST method in healthy adult volunteers. Propranolol (40 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, reduced systolic blood pressure, and enhanced cognitive flexibility during stress. In another study propranolol (80 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, but paradoxically increased salivary cortisol, and did not significantly affect BP or subjective stress [25]. But, in another TSST study daily oral propranolol (80 mg) did not affect the salivary cortisol response [27].

In cavity wall construction, the air space provides a partial isolation of the two wythes. Sound on one side of a cavity wall causes vibration of a wythe. Because of the separation and cushioning effect of the air space and the massiveness of the masonry, the vibration is dampened and greatly reduced. A 10-in. (250 mm) brick cavity wall with brick backing has a Sound Transmission Class (STC) rating of 50, which is usually sufficient for substantially reducing typical outside noises entering the building through the wall. For more information on sound transmission, see Technical Notes 5A.

number of cancer cases (O/E) among cancer survivors in popu- lation-based cancer registries are used to describe the risk for a subsequent cancer diagnosis, with the number expected based on cancer occurrence in the general population. As a whole, can- cer survivors have a small increased risk of additional cancers, although risk is higher for those with a history of childhood can- cer (Figure 15, page 25), as well as for adult survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma and tobacco-related cancers (oral cavity and pharynx, lung and bronchus, kidney and renal pelvis, esophagus, and urinary bladder) (Figure 16). For example, female survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma treated with radiation to the chest are at

Sheet metals used for flashing include stainless steel, copper, lead-coated copper and galvanized steel. Aluminum should not be used since it can corrode in fresh mortar. Stainless steel and copper materials are the most durable, but are also the most expensive. Galvanized steel has also been used in limited applications. These flashing materials have a greater life expectancy than composite or fabric flashing. Sheet metal flashing is bent and formed on site and sealed by soldering or with adhesives and rivets. This additional installation time can result in additional construction costs. Stainless steel materials should conform the ASTM A 167 Specification for Stainless and Heat-Resisting Steel Plate, Sheet and Strip. Copper flashing should comply with ASTM B 370 Specification for Copper Sheet and Strip for Building Construction. Solder should conform to ASTM B 32 Specification for Solder Metal.

Rectal cancer patients require a colostomy more often than colon cancer patients (29% versus 12%, respectively).82 A permanent colos- tomy may be required if the anus and the sphincter muscle are removed during surgery.

A further measure that may reduce medicine price is tax reduction or exemption. Medicines may be subject to different taxes in countries that consider medicines like other consumer goods for the purpose of taxation. These include the application of import tariffs and value-added tax (VAT) (Table 3.4, p.43). Countries that are signatories to the reciprocal Pharmaceutical Tariff Elimination Agreement, or the “zero- for-zero” initiative, have 0% tariff (198). The zero-for-zero initiative has extended to some non-signatory countries, including low- and middle-income countries. Some countries have also implemented tax exemption specifically targeting cancer medicines. For example, from May 2018, the Government of China has exempted import tariffs on common medicines, including 16 cancer medicines (199). Such initiatives would require concurrent enforcement efforts to ensure that any savings from tax reduction or exemption are directly transferred to service providers or patients.

This Technical Note describes the mechanisms of efflorescence, including possible sources of salts and water, providing a basic understanding of the phenomenon of efflorescence that is essential to minimize its occurrence. Although similar, sources of salts and the development of efflorescence on paving surfaces are discussed in the Technical Notes 14 Series on brick pavements.

In this section, we report the main results to demonstrate that the proposed feature space can effectively predict the polarity and strength of the relationships extracted from biomedical literature. These results also indicate that not every feature contributes equally to the two problems under study. The annotated corpus described in section 2 is used for our evaluation studies. (See Tables 4-5 for the corpus distribution according to polarity and strength.) We perform 10-fold cross validation throughout our evaluation. Classification accuracy is primarirly used to measure the performance of each SVM, whereas prediction accuracy is used for each SVR. We use the SVMLight package by [23] for our experiments.

the fact that 11 of the 12 medicines approved by the United States Food & Drug Administration (US FDA) in 2012 for various cancer indications were priced above US$ 100 000 per year. The experts asserted that the prices of these medicines were too high, unsustainable, might compromise access of needy patients to highly effective therapy, and harmful to the sustainability of national health care systems (30). Similarly, in 2015, yet another group of cancer experts have petitioned for lower medicine prices (31).

Whereas Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) concentrates on human intelligence, and Knowledge Discovery in Data Mining (KDD) concentrates on machine intelligence, the grand challenge is to combine these diverse fields to support the expert end users in learning to interactively analyze information properties thus enabling them to visualize the relevant parts of their data. In other words, to enable effective human control over powerful machine intelligence and to integrate statistical methods with information visualization, to support human insight and decision making (Holzinger, 2011a). The broad application of business enterprise hospital information systems amasses large amounts of medical documents, which must be reviewed, observed, and analyzed by human experts (Holzinger et al., 2008a). All essential documents of the patient records contain a certain portion of data which has been entered in non- standardized format (aka free text). Although text can easily be created by the end users, the support of automatic analysis is extremely difficult (Gregory, Mattison & Linde, 1995), (Holzinger et al., 2000), (Lovis, Baud & Planche, 2000).

In this report, the term “cancer survivor” refers to any person with a history of cancer, from the time of diagnosis through the remainder of their life. Henceforth, the terms cancer patient and cancer survivor are used interchangeably without preference, although it is recognized that not all people with a cancer diag- nosis identify with the term “cancer survivor.”

Proper Sizing-Firebox dimensions should be selected so that the fire fills the combustion chamber during operation. This provides greater heating efficiency. Careful consideration should be given to size of the fireplace opening best suited for the room in which it is to be located. Location and size are important not only from the standpoint of appearance, but also of operation. If the fireplace opening is too small, it may function properly but will not produce enough heat to warm the room. If the opening is too large, a fire that would fill the combustion chamber may overwhelm the room. In such a case, the firebox opening would require a larger flue area and consume larger amounts of interior air even if exterior combustion air is provided. Table 2 provides suggested widths of conventional fireplace openings appropriate for various room sizes. For example, a room with 300 ft2 (28 m2) of floor area is best served by a fireplace with an opening 30 in. (750 mm) to 36 in. (900 mm) wide.

Readership analysis was conducted on the 20 science journals in our data set (n(cid:1)2903). Articles published in the social sciences and humanities journals (n(cid:1)350) were omitted from the readership analysis, as many did not include abstract or full-text versions of their articles, and, in some cases, refer- ence views were added to full-text views, resulting in indeter- minate and incomparable results. Citation analyses were conducted on the entire article data set (n(cid:1)3245). A logistic regression model was used to estimate the likelihood of articles in each experimental group being cited within the first year after publication, controlling for journal and journal category effects.
their applications are restricted. Call support systems with diagnosing support for naive doctors and for knowledgeable doctors would be a tenet for higher clinical cognitive process. The primary initiative is that the prospective costs and effects of diagnosis can be measured and used to enhance the task. Furthermore, the transitional enquiry steps such as asking for more systematic studies, or more examination done by human professionals, can also be computed in terms of cost and effect. Based on these cost and effect, the system can learn to recommend the optimal action. Providing precious services at cheap prices may be a major constraint encountered by the aid organizations (hospitals, medical centers). Valuable quality service denotes the correct diagnosing of patients and providing economical treatment. Acceptable computer-based info and/or call support systems will aid in achieving clinical tests at a reduced value. Due to the accessibility of integrated info through huge patient repositories, there is a swing within the insight of clinicians, patients and payers from qualitative health care sectors.

Wind turbines will be used to harness the kinetic energy of the moving air over the oceans on the OCS and convert it to electricity. Offshore winds are less turbulent (because the ocean is flat relative to onshore topography), and they tend to flow at higher speeds than onshore winds, thus allowing turbines to produce more electricity. Because the potential energy produced from the wind is directly proportional to the cube of the wind speed, increased wind speeds of only a few miles per hour can produce a significantly larger amount of electricity. For instance, a turbine at a site with an average wind speed of 16 mph would produce 50% more electricity than at a site with the same turbine and average wind speeds of 14 mph (Offshore Wind 2006).

Multivariate linear regression models were used to estimate the effect of the open access treatment on article readership and citations. Covariates in these models include the journal in which the article appeared, type of article (review, other), length of article (in pages), number of authors, and whether the article was self-archived. Continuous variables (page length, number of authors, and number of citations) were log transformed to adhere to the assumption of normality re- quired for linear regression. As we were not interested in estimating citation effects for each particular journal, but to control for the variation in journal effects generally, journals were considered random effects in the regression models.

In the absence of a Medicare National Coverage Determination (NCD), Local Coverage Determination (LCD), or other Medicare coverage guidance, CMS allows a Medicare Advantage Organization (MAO) to create its own coverage determinations, using objective evidence-based rationale relying on authoritative evidence (Medicare IOM Pub. No. 100-16, Ch. 4, §90.5).

The randomization, selection, and manipulation of access status for treatment articles were controlled entirely by the researcher, who was provided with direct access to the admin- istration of the journal websites. Authors and editors were not alerted as to which articles received the open access treat- ment. For some journals, treatment articles were indicated on the journal websites by an open lock icon.
Efflorescence is normally a harmless deposit of water- soluble, white salt crystals, as shown in Photo 1. In some instances efflorescence may appear on mortar joints as shown in Photo 2. Efflorescence may appear in limited areas on the surface of brickwork as shown in Photo 3 or, in extreme cases, cover the entire brickwork surface.

In the clinical laboratory, sleep is defined by its electro- encephalography (EEG) in concert with electromyog- raphy (EMG), electrooculography (EOG) and other telemetry. Using polysomnographic recordings, sleep can be classified into rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. The NREM sleep is further classified into 3 sleep stages namely Stage N1 sleep, Stage N2 sleep, and stage N3 sleep (also known as slow wave sleep, delta sleep or deep sleep), based primarily on the occurrence of synchronous physiologic EEG potentials. Drowsy awake with eyes closed is defined by the presence of alpha - the fre- quency with the most power on spectral analysis. Sleep onset (Stage N1) is generally defined as occurring at the point in which there is a decline of alpha rhythm (9– 11 Hz) to less than 50% of the recorded epoch. Stage N2 sleep is denoted by bursts of sleep spindles at sigma fre- quency (11–16 Hz) and K-complex events - electro- physiological down states known to negatively affect the general tendency of neurons to develop spike potential activity (Cash et al. 2009). Deep sleep (stage N3 sleep) oc- curs in association with delta frequency oscillations (0.5– 1.5 Hz). REM sleep is characterized by bursts of intracra- nial theta (5–8 Hz), with alpha and gamma oscillations noted in scalp recordings, associated with conjugate eye

As you know, my office represents the City and County of San Francisco, including its Health Officer Dr. Aragón, who has issued a stay-safe-at-home order and related health orders to protect the residents of this City during this unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. (See https://www.sfdph.org/dph/alerts/coronavirus-healthorders.asp.) Dr. Aragón understands and respects the importance of religion to the spiritual well-being and mental health of many, and accordingly has encouraged San Franciscans to continue to practice their religious faith in all ways that are safe. It is for this reason that the Health Officer issued a revised health order on June 11, 2020 (Order of the Health Officer No. C19-07e, the “Health Order”), which allows for in-person outdoor services conducted according to science-based safeguards that will minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission.
