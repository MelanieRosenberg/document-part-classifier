DOs are perhaps most commonly confused with DCs, or Doctors of Chiropractic.  While there is some overlap between the two types of practitioners, they represent dis- tinct professions and separate schools of thought.
Chi- ropractic was first enunciated in 1895 by Daniel David Palmer, who observed that displacement of vertebrae could affect neurotransmission, thus manifesting as dis- ease.  Palmer was a magnetic healer, but unlike A.T.  Still, he did not have a medical background.
While the chiro- practic philosophy is historically focused on the nervous system, the original notion of osteopathic medicine was the need to restore blood flow, in particular, via manipula- tion of the neuromusculoskeletal system.6 The differences in education and training between the two
professions are apparent.
A table comparing the background of DOs, MDs, and DCs is provided below.16 It is important to note that DOs who go on to specialize in neuromusculoskeltal.
medicine (NMM) and OMM obtain many more hundreds of hours of manual medicine training in a wider variety of clinical settings than DCs and other DOs.
This section was meant to give you a better sense of what “osteopathic manipulative medicine” entails, and hopefully it answered most of your questions regarding OMM.
The effectiveness of OMM remains a topic of ongoing debate and research despite past and current efforts to lay these arguments to rest.  Whether an osteo- pathic physician uses OMM in his or her practice is based entirely on preference.
With that said, it is an important core discipline and primary distinction of the osteopathic profession.

Information Management Systems, Inc.  Oncology Analyzer database, survival data, expert opinion, data from the literature, and unit costs from various published offi cial sources.
Costs were infl ated to 2006 rates using consumer price indexes (France, Germany, Italy and Spain) or a health infl ation index (UK).
The initial treatment costs per patient, which included the cost of biopsy and subsequent surgical or non- surgical treatment, were € 3171 in the UK, € 4057 in Germany, € 5851 in France, € 5226 in Italy and € 3256 in Spain ( Fig.  1 ).
Surgery accounted for the largest proportion of initial treatment costs in most countries, with the exception of the UK, where radiotherapy accounted for a greater percentage ( Fig.  1 ).
Costs of treatment over 1 year were calculated for all patients, regardless of whether they were treated, and included the unit costs of treatment, relapse costs and average monthly follow-up costs.
The total costs for all diagnosed patients in the fi rst year after diagnosis were € 116.7 million (UK), € 179 million (Germany), € 167.5 million (France), € 106.7 million (Italy) and € 114.6 million (Spain).  In comparison, a recent study in Italy by Lazzaro et al .
[ 13 ] also looked at the fi rst-year costs of prostate cancer in 2000.  The estimated cost per patient in Italy was € 6600, which is higher than the value estimated in the Fourcade publication [ 14 ] .
The difference in values is probably attributable to lower rates of radiation treatment and a higher use of hormonal treatment in the Lazzaro study, in which.
Total 5-year costs, including costs of both diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer, is reported in a second study by Fourcade et al .  (Benedict A, Fourcade RO, Black LK, Stokes ME, Alcaraz A, Castro RS.  Long term costs of prostate cancer: estimates for France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK.
In preparation.  2011 ).  These values were € 269 million (UK), € 618 million (France), € 486 million (Germany), € 364 million (Italy) and € 198 million (Spain).
A UK study estimated that total costs for men diagnosed with prostate cancer in the 2001 – 2002 BAUS data with 5-year follow-up, were £ 92.74 million, with an average cost per patient of £ 7294 over 5 years [ 16 ] , higher than Fourcade ’ s UK estimates, which ranged between € 7040 and € 8580 ( £
5547 – £ 6761) depending on cancer stage.
Discrepancies between the two studies may arise through differences in the estimations of individual treatment costs, the proportions of patients receiving each type of therapy, or a combination of both.
Results from three sources presenting cost data for prostate cancer in the USA are shown in Table 1 [ 12,15,17 ] . The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has published annual cost data for prostate cancer using the most recent cancer incidence, survival and cost
of care data [ 12 ] .  The NCI estimate for expenditure on prostate cancer treatment in 2006 was $9.862 billion, and average Medicare payments per patient in the fi rst year after diagnosis were $11 000.
It should be noted when interpreting this data that use of PSA testing for prostate cancer is more widespread in the USA than in many other countries, thus increasing the number of cases identifi ed.
In addition, Medicare did not cover certain cancer care expenses such as oral medicines, commonly used to treat prostate cancer until January 2006.  These out-of-pocket costs may comprise 10% of the $11 000 estimate.
Direct medical expenditures are only one part of the total economic burden of cancer, as cancer- related illnesses and death lead to losses in economic productivity.
Recent analyses of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)- Medicare database tracked healthcare use and costs (projected to 2004 levels) from diagnosis and initial treatment [ 15 ] , in addition to a 4-year follow-up [ 17 ] , for a cohort of 81 659 elderly patients with prostate
cancer who had Medicare claims from 1991 to 2003 [ 15 ] , and 1991 to 2004 [ 17 ] , respectively.
Treatment in the fi rst year after diagnosis was calculated to incur costs of $21 040 per patient; $13 091 for prostate cancer-related costs and $7949 for medical costs unrelated to prostate cancer [ 15 ] .
In terms of cost at each stage, as expected, there was an increase in costs from stage I to IV [ 15,17 ] .  Prostate cancer-related costs over 4 years from diagnosis averaged $18 168 per patient [ 17 ] .
The annual healthcare cost burden estimated in 2009 is > $2.5 billion annually for initial care alone [ 17 ] .
A recent analysis of US managed care data revealed similar costs for initial therapy in men with prostate cancer [ 18 ] .  During the fi rst 2 years after diagnosis, the average total cost across all patients was $48 808, with $29 417 representing prostate cancer-related costs.
Those patients receiving treatment incurred costs fi ve times higher than those undergoing watchful waiting ($38 945 vs $7595).  The highest costs were incurred within the fi rst 3 months after diagnosis and decreased substantially over time.
Among patients receiving initial treatment, surgery incurred costs of $31 666 with the majority attributable to inpatient costs ($26 539).

Off-label Use of Drugs and Biologicals in an Anti-Cancer Chemotherapeutic Regimen Effective January 1, 1994, off-label, medically accepted indications of Food and Drug Administration-(FDA) approved drugs and biologicals used in an anti-cancer chemotherapeutic regimen are identified under the
conditions described below.
A regimen is a combination of anti-cancer agents clinically recognized for the treatment of a specific type of cancer.  Off-label, medically accepted indications are supported in either one or more of the compendia or in peer-reviewed medical literature.
Compendia documentation or peer- reviewed literature supporting off-label use by the treating physician may also be requested.
Do not deny coverage based solely on the absence of FDA-approved labeling for the use, if the use is supported by any of the following compendia and the use is not listed as unsupported, not indicated, not recommended, or equivalent terms, in any of the following compendia:
Medical misdiagnosis, in the form of inaccurate, late, and delayed diagnoses, is an ongoing problem in the U.S. Not only do these diagnostic errors present an ongoing risk to the health and safety of patients, but they also cost the economy billions of dollars.
This paper summarizes the key research findings on the frequency, human cost, and financial impact of these diagnostic errors, while providing new data on the value of second opinions.
An extensive Institute of Medicine (IOM) report underscores the importance of this with its conclusion that most Americans will receive an inaccurate or late diagnosis at least once in their lives, often with life-threatening consequences.
Misdiagnosis is the subject of a growing number of studies.  The most recent one, Improving Diagnosis in Healthcare from the Institute of Medicine (IOM), explores the findings of many of these studies and notes that each year, approximately 12 million people in the U.S.
who seek outpatient medical care experience some form of diagnostic error1.
Another Johns Hopkins study found that out of 6,000 cases from medical institutions across the country, one out of every 71 cancer cases was misdiagnosed and up to one out of five cancers were misclassified, errors which can result in delayed or inappropriate treatment.2.
Misdiagnosis too frequently results in serious harm to patients.  In a survey of physicians, 64% said that up to 10% of the misdiagnoses they have experienced directly resulted in harm to the patient6.
Another study found that 28% of 538 reported diagnostic errors were life-threatening or resulted in the patient’s death or permanent disability.7.
Since effective treatment depends upon an accurate and effective diagnosis, misdiagnosis can also lead to inappropriate or unnecessary testing, such as biopsies and treatment that may cause harm.
A study by the Rand Corporation discovered that 30% of common surgical procedures, including coronary artery bypass graft surgery, were provided for reasons that were not supported by clinical studies and/or evidence-based treatment guidelines and may have resulted in complications or harm to the
patients.8.
The IOM report supports these findings, stating that diagnostic errors contribute to 10% of patient deaths and 6-17% of hospital adverse events.
Other researchers quantify the human cost of diagnostic errors at between 40,000 and 80,000 deaths per year.9 These troubling findings make developing effective methods to prevent diagnostic errors an urgent priority.

The numbers in each block are codes for the treatment given to each animal.  The purpose of such a design is to reduce heterogeneity associated with time, space and some physical varia- tion.
The five animals in Block 1 would be chosen to be as similar as possible with respect to age, weight, genotype and any other variable which might influence the outcome.  They would then be assigned at random to one of the five treatments.
The animals would be housed in close proximity, and possibly even in the same cage, if the different treatments can be given in such a situation.
When measurements are to be made on the animals, those in Block 1 would be treated as a group, with all measurements being made within a short period by the same per- son.
Animals in the other blocks would likewise be selected to be as uniform as possible, but might differ in body weight or age, etc.  from those in Block 1.  They could be measured at a dif- ferent time, if necessary by a different person.
Thus, within each block any comparison among treatments would be made on animals which are in all possible ways as similar as possible.  The unwanted variation shows up as differences between blocks.  This is then removed mathe- matically in the statistical analysis.
The randomised block design provides a means to break down an experiment into smaller parts, which can be handled more conveniently. In most cases, it will increase the precision at no extra cost, apart from the need for a slightly more-complex statistical analysis.
example, be difficult for a factorial experi- mental design with several treatment combi- nations and dependent variables.  An estimate of the SD could be obtained from a previous study, from the literature, or from a pilot study.  However, all these sources of informa- tion are subject to error.
The significance level is usually set, somewhat arbitrarily, at 0.05, and the power is likewise often set at 80(cid:150)90%.
Thus, although doing a power analysis is a useful exercise in showing the potential capa- bility of various proposed experiments to detect an effect of biological interest, it does not always give a definitive answer of the most appropriate size of each experiment.
It is strongly recommended, therefore, that sam- ple sizes are continually reviewed as experi- mental results become available.
An advantage of a power analysis is that it can be used to explore the implications of negative results, i.e.  those in which there is no significant difference between treatment means.
Such negative results might be of bio- logical interest, particularly in safety testing, if they are real, but are of little interest if the lack of statistical significance was because the experiment was too small to detect a treatment difference of potential interest.
Thus, a power analysis can be used to find out the probability that the experiment would have been able to detect a specified treatment effect if it was really there.
For example, in the diet experiment discussed previously, suppose that an experiment had been undertaken to compare the two diets with ten mice per group, and that the mean.

Restoring the health of the housing market is a necessary part of a broader strategy for economic recovery.  There has been much discussion about the pathway forward, and the Federal Reserve has received questions and requests for our input and assistance.
We have been looking at these issues and in the interest of continuing a dialogue, my staff has written a white paper, entitled "The U.S.
Housing Market: Current Conditions and Policy Considerations." In this report, we do not attempt to address every problem faced by the housing market; rather, it is our intention to provide a framework for thinking about certain issues and tradeoffs that policymakers might consider.
I have enclosed a copy of the white paper for your review. I and my staff would be happy to discuss these ideas more fully. I hope that you will not hesitate to contact me if we can be of assistance.
Antimalarial efficacy screening: in vitro and in vivo protocols.  Supplemental file.  animals are prepared and stained with Giemsa.  Parasitemia is determined microscopically by counting 4 fields of approximately 100 erythrocytes per field.
For low parasitemias (<1%), up to 4000 erythrocytes have to be counted.  Alternatively the parasitemia can also be determined by FACS analysis, which works particularly well for parasitemias >1%.
The difference between the mean value of the control group (taken as 100%) and those of the experimental groups is calculated and expressed as percent reduction (= activity) using the following equation:.
For slow acting drugs, additional smears should be taken on day 5 and day 6, the parasitemia determined and the activity calculated.  Untreated control mice typically will die approximately one week after infection.
For treated mice the survival-time (in days) is recorded and the mean survival time is calculated in comparison to untreated and standard drug treated groups.  Mice still without parasitaemia on day 30 post-infection are considered cured.
Observations concerning adverse effects due to the drug, including weight loss, are recorded.
Compounds showing good in vivo activity in the primary 4-day suppressive test should be evaluated further in secondary in vivo models (Supplemental Box 1).  Mice, maintenance, drug preparation and application, and assessment of parasitemia are the same as for the basic 4-day treatment protocol.
These secondary in vivo methods include:.
Dose ranging test: Here, compounds are tested at a minimum of 4 different doses (the “dose ranging, full 4-day test”, typically 100, 30, 10 and 3 mg/kg, by both s.c.  and p.o.  routes of administration).
ED 50 and ED 90 values are calculated by plotting the log dose against probit activity (for example, using Microcal “Origin”).  These reflect the drug concentrations at which 50% and 90% of suppression of parasitemia is achieved.
Note that with short half-life drugs it may be necessary to dose multiple times per day.  Two other parameters measured in this study are relative potency compared to an appropriate standard drug, and oral bioavailability (assessed by comparison of oral and parenteral administration).  However,.
receptor antagonist that affects the autonomic nervous system and reduces cardiovascular symptoms (e.g., tachycardia and hypertension) resulting from epinephrine in the circulation.
Beta blockers interfere with receptor binding by catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine, of which epinephrine is the principal catecholamine affecting the cardiovascular symptoms.  Propranolol is a lipophilic beta blocker that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier.
Therefore, it can affect both somatic and CNS target tissues.
Propranolol is routinely delivered orally.  Propranolol in Inderal® is available in oral doses ranging from 10 to 80 mg per dose for the treatment of hypertension.  Multiple doses per day may be permitted.
This drug can also be absorbed mucosally, as demonstrated by sublingual delivery [12], and its bioavailability is higher when absorbed by this route rather than orally [13,14].
Propranolol has been delivered sublingually at 10 and 40 mg per dose [12,13], although this can produce mouth paresthesia, an undesirable effect.  Also, propranolol has been delivered by rectal administration in mammals [15].
It does not demonstrate chemical dependence or sedation that are common side effects of many psychiatric medications.
Propranolol is prescribed for the treatment of various cardiovascular indications with FDA approval, most notably hypertension, arrhythmia, angina, as well as prophylaxis of migraines.
However, there is evidence that it can have some benefit with regard to a subset of the symptoms of panic and anxiety disorders.
The drug’s anxiolytic potential was recognized as early as 1966, “Emotions are expressed through the autonomic nervous system, and anxiety states are associated with increased secretion of catecholamines.
Propranolol may therefore have a place in the treatment of anxiety, especially when the symptoms are related to the cardiovascular system [16].” This prescient comment five decades ago was subsequently validated by clinical studies with regard to both aspects: (a) propranolol and other beta blockers
have been used “off label” in the USA for the near-term prophylaxis of performance anxiety; and (b) the pharmacologic benefits of propranolol and other beta blockers are restricted to the cardiovascular system’s effects per se.
The evidence is provided below.
The beneficial anxiolytic effects are limited to blocking the pharmacologic effects of catecholamines upon the cardiovascular system without addressing the psychic (CNS) symptoms or other somatic symptoms of acute anxiety and panic, with the possible exception of tremors.
(Table 1) summarizes the relevant evidence from clinical investigations in the literature regarding beta blockers used to treat anxiety conditions.
Daily oral propranolol has been demonstrated in one prophylactic study to suppress panic attacks in subjects diagnosed with panic disorder and agoraphobia [17].
Tyrer and Lader demonstrated some effectiveness of oral propranolol in treating somatic anxiety symptoms, but not psychic (mental) anxiety [18,19].
Another daily oral prophylactic study compared propranolol (3 x 80 mg/day) to oxprenolol (3 x 80 mg/day) and revealed that both beta blockers reduced symptoms of anxiety at one or two weeks duration [20].
Both treatments reduced heart rate; propranolol by ~ 21 - 32 bpm and oxprenolol by ~ 16 - 23 bpm.  However, propranolol was more effective at reducing palpitations when assessed on day 7 compared to oxprenolol.  Another study demonstrated that.
a single dose of 40 mg of oxprenolol prior to speaking to an audience suppressed tachycardia in performance anxiety [21]. In contrast, in another clinical study daily oral propranolol was not effective at treating panic disorder and agoraphobia with panic attacks [22].
The TSST method has been used to study the effects of oral propranolol in volunteer subjects [25-28].  The assessments of psychic anxiety can be assessed by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) or other similar tools [29,30].
The somatic and psychic effects of oral propranolol were tested using the TSST method in healthy adult volunteers.  Propranolol (40 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, reduced systolic blood pressure, and enhanced cognitive flexibility during stress.
In another study propranolol (80 mg) one hour prior to TSST significantly reduced heart rate, but paradoxically increased salivary cortisol, and did not significantly affect BP or subjective stress [25].
But, in another TSST study daily oral propranolol (80 mg) did not affect the salivary cortisol response [27].

Pain assessment involves more than just quantifying theintensityofpain.Highpainintensityratingsorbehav- ioralscalescoresthatdonotrespondtousualcareshould be investigated to determine whether the pain might be due to a new medical issue or surgical complication and the potential role of opioid
tolerance and psychological distress.
Assessment should determine what interven- tions have been effective for the pain, how the pain af- fects function, the type of pain (eg, neuropathic, visceral, somatic, muscle spasms), and whether there are barriers to effective pain management, such as cultural
orlanguagedifferences,cognitivedeficits,orpatientmis- conceptions about pain management (Table 2).
In addi- tion, it is not sufficient to assess pain only at rest.  Pain that is relativelywell controlled at rest canbe severe dur- ing movement or with specific activities that cause increased pain (eg, swallowing after tonsillectomy), with important implications for symptom management and recovery.
The panel suggests that clinicians assess pain at rest and with activities, as the latter is often more severe and difficult to control than pain at rest.110,270 Presence of pain with activity has important implications for use of additional interventions and discharge planning.
For example, pain that is well controlled at rest but severe with movement can have major effects on a patient’s ability to participate in postsurgical rehabilitation and return to normal function, and pain with swallowing after tonsillectomy could increase risk for dehydration.
Assessments for other clinical issues such as sedation, delirium, and nausea or other side effects related to interventions are also important to help guide decisions regarding adjustmentofthe postoperativepain management plan.
There is insufficient evidence to guide firm recom- mendations on optimal timing or frequency of patient reassessments in the postoperative setting.
The timing of assessments after administration of an intervention should be informed by the time to achieve peak ef- fects, which is typically 15 to 30 minutes after paren- teral drug therapy or 1 to 2 hours after administration of an oral analgesic.
With nonpharma- cologic interventions, pain relief often occurs during or immediately after their application.
The optimal fre- quency of reassessment is likely to depend on a num- ber of factors, including the type of surgical procedure, the adequacy of initial pain relief, the pres- ence of side effects, presence of comorbidities, and.
changes in clinical status.  Reassessments might be per- formed less frequently for patients with more stable pain (eg, patients who have exhibited good pain con- trol without side effects after 24 hours of stable ther- apy).
Pain reassessments might be useful at the time of nursing shift changes or with new caregivers to establish a baseline and promote continuity of care, although evidence showing that routine reassessment of pain at nursing shift changes is associated with improved clinical outcomes is not available.
(cid:2) The panel recommends that clinicians offer multi- modal analgesia, or the use of a variety of analgesic medications and techniques combined with non- pharmacological interventions, for the treatment of postoperative pain in children and adults (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).
Multimodal analgesia, defined as the use of a variety of analgesic medication and techniques that target different mechanisms of action in the peripheral and/or central nervous system (which might also be combined with nonpharmacological interventions) might have ad-
ditiveorsynergisticeffectsandmoreeffectivepainrelief compared with single-modality interventions.
For example, clinicians might offer local anesthetic-based regional (peripheral and neuraxial) analgesic techniques in combination with systemic opioids and other analge- sics as part of a multimodal approach to perioperative pain.
Because of the availability of effective nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies for postop- erative pain management, the panel suggests that clini- cians routinely incorporate around the clock nonopioid analgesics and nonpharmacologic therapies into multi- modal analgesia regimens.
Systemic opioids might not be required in all patients.  One study suggests that it shouldbeavoidedwhennotneeded,becauselimitedev- idence suggests that perioperative opioid therapy might be associated with increased likelihood of long-term opioid use, with its attendant risks.4.

Producing competent primary care physicians, in par- ticular, is part of the mission statement of many, if not all, U.S.  osteopathic medical schools.  According to the 2014 U.S.
News and World Report, a popular source of medical school rankings, osteopathic medical schools rank among the top producers of primary care doctors in the nation, with Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine (MSUCOM) being one of the ten top-ranked medical school in this
category.13 Consequently, some cur- ricula may place a greater emphasis on such skills as bed- side manner, interviewing and building the physician- patient relationship.
These schools do not in any way force students to go into primary care – many students simply choose to do so.14.
Osteopathic medical schools also use differing cri- teria when selecting candidates to interview and/or extending offers of admission.  For example, in the eval- uation of applicants, osteopathic medical schools place more emphasis on candidates’ interest in and knowledge of osteopathic philosophy.
They also are more likely to seek out students who are interested in pursuing careers in primary care and in rural or underserved areas.3 Osteo- pathic admissions programs often view the candidate as a.
whole, and are more forgiving in the sense that they accept grade replacement for repeated courses.
They are less likely to place as much emphasis on Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) scores and/or GPAs as allopathic schools do.12 These differing criteria may explain some of the existing disparities in average admissions statis- tics between admitted students of osteopathic med- ical schools
and those of allopathic medical schools.
The 19,517 matriculating allopathic students in 2012 had an average combined MCAT score of 31.2 (Physical Science: 10.5, Verbal Reasoning: 9.8, Biological Science: 10.9) and average GPAs of 3.63, 3.75, and 3.68 for science, non- science, and total, respectively.15 In contrast, the same year, the
5,464 matriculating osteopathic medical students had an average MCAT score of 26.85 (PS: 8.74, VR: 8.63, BS: 9.48) with average science, non-science, and total GPAs of 3.37, 3.59, and 3.49, respectively.16 The other major factor contributing to this disparity is the difference in the actual
applicant pools.
Currently, the majority of medical school applicants do not apply to osteopathic medical programs, likely due to a general lack of accessible and reliable information concerning osteo- pathic medicine.  Many applicants have not had any signif-.
Value-based pricing or value pricing aims to determine the prices of medicines according to the value or worth that patients and health systems attribute to the medicines.
In theory, by linking price to value, value- based approaches are more likely to encourage companies to innovate and produce medicines with attributes that society and governments value most.
In the context of medicines this would mean the public and government would be willing to pay for medicines that improve health conditions and minimize harms.
considerable challenge in assessing, measuring and translating the value of a medicine to a price.  In particular, there is no universally accepted view on what dimensions of value should be considered for the purpose of determining medicine prices.  Fig.
3.8 (p.34) shows the various dimensions of value noted in the literature and government guidelines, summarized into eight themes.
Common dimensions considered in health technology assessments are: clinical and public health needs for the proposed medicine, clinical evidence, economic and financial public health considerations.
More debatable is whether to include as innovativeness of the medicine, and the need to incentivize future.
samples)) / (geometric mean cpm of no drug samples).  Percentage reductions are used to plot percentage inhibition of growth as a function of drug concentrations.
IC 50 values are determined by linear regression analyses on the linear segments of the curves (IC 90 values can also be determined by curve-fitting and can provide an useful measure of variation between experiments).  Assays are typically repeated on two or three separate occasions.
Within each experiment, standard deviations are typically less than 10% of the mean.
Differences in parasite stages of development can lead to up to two-fold shifts in the IC 50 values between experiments; however, these differences rarely affect the overall relationships between the parasite lines in terms of their differences in drug response 4-11 .
Multiplication rate refers to increase in total numbers of viable parasites per 48-hr generation.  These rates and the drug pheno- types refer to data from the Fidock laboratory (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, NY) and may not be the same elsewhere.

cancers.  The 10 most prevalent cancers represented among male and female survivors are shown in Figure 1, page 1.
Cancers of the prostate and colon and rectum, and melanoma are the three most prevalent among males, whereas cancers of the breast, uterine corpus, and colon and rectum are most prevalent among females.
It is important to note that the number of total survivors is fewer than the sum of all cancers combined because some people are diagnosed with more than one type of cancer.
The majority of cancer survivors (67%) were diagnosed 5 or more years ago, and 17% were diagnosed 20 or more years ago (Table 1).  Nearly half (47%) of survivors are 70 years of age or older, while only 11% are younger than 50 (Table 2).
There are many different types of cancer treatment, including surgery, radiation therapy, and/or systemic therapy (e.g., chemo- therapy, hormonal therapy, immune therapy, and targeted therapy).
Treatments may be used alone or in combination depending on the type and stage of cancer; tumor characteris-.

Throughout the history of medicine, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has played a significant role in the treatment of cancer patients.
In 1999, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) created the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) in recognition of this growing field.
Research funding to the NCCAM has risen from $ 2 million in 1992 to $50 million by 2000 and is expected to be more than $110 million by the mid-2000’s [1].  A survey conducted in 2005 indicated that approximately 35.9% of cancer patients attempted use of CAM during their treatment course [2].
In fact, that percentage may be even higher as studies have shown that many patients do not disclose the use of CAM therapy unless asked specifically [3].
Physicians poorly communicate with their patients regarding the potential benefits or harms of CAM because they have minimal understanding of CAM therapy and its physiological role in managing diseases [4,5].
Patients are often dissatisfied with their physicians’ lack of knowledge regarding CAM therapy [6].  Patients who have a history of incorporating CAM into their management plan are generally driven by personal beliefs and principles regarding life and health [7].
An increased use of CAM has been seen in patients with increased psychosocial stress or poor prognosis at initial diagnosis [8,9].  Additionally, females and younger patients have a higher predilection for using CAM therapy [10].
There are numerous modalities of CAM such as spiritual healing or prayer, herbal medicine, and chiropractics [11].  This review focuses on medicinal therapies used as CAM for patients suffering from malignancy, specifically lung cancer.
CAM specific to lung cancer has focused on therapeutic options that may have less systemic toxicity compared to current chemotherapy options such as Gemcitabine, Paclitaxel, and Etoposide.
Herbal plants that have been used in lung cancer therapy include Platycodon grandiflorum (Campanulaceae), Morus alba (Moraceae), Prunus armeniaca (Rosaceae), Rhus verniciflua (Anacardiaceae), Perilla frutescens (Labiatae), Stemona japonica (Stemonaceae), Tusilago farfara (Compositae), and Draba
nemorosa (Brassicaceae) [12].
Although these are used as alternative modes of therapy, it is more common for herbal remedies to be used as adjuvant modalities with chemotherapy [13].  The role of these herbal therapies is multifactorial.
They can be used to reduce chemotherapy-induced toxicity, mitigate cancer-related symptoms, or directly increase anti- cancer effects [14].
A randomized control trial (RCT) of 61 patients evaluated the use of herbal medications as adjuvant therapy and showed an enhancement in median survival in the group that was treated with Sheng-mai and Gu- jin Granule along with Navelbine and Cisplatin [15].
This group had a 48.5% increase in survival compared to 32.2% in the control arm that only received the two chemotherapy drugs.
Another study enrolled 232 non-small cell lung cancer patients and showed that Shenqi-fuzheng, an herbal injection similar to Sheng- mai, served as a useful adjuvant to chemotherapy by improving quality of life [16].
Similarly another RCT of 121 patients with advanced non- small cell lung cancer showed improved quality of life and a trend towards increase in survival time in patients assigned to Kangliuzengxiao and Feiyanning in addition to chemotherapy [17].
Fiji Recipe therapy has been shown to alleviate chemotherapy side effects and enhance therapeutic efficacy [18].  Similarly, other studies have demonstrated the benefits of CAM therapy in mitigating the adverse effects of chemotherapy, including myalgia and diarrhea [19,20].
A case report showed regression of small cell lung cancer with the use of Chinese herbal medicines [21].  Lastly, another case report.
identical unigrams and exhibit similar semantics-based sequential structures.  Hence SVM is not able to differentiate between positive and neutral relationships.
To give an example the below sentence has features which are the same as a positive relationship but is labeled as neutral due to lack of contextual information.  {\chemical P-ASA} {\relationship 2= increased} intracellular levels of {\chemical reactive oxygen species}.
Finally we can also observe that the (1 vs.  All) SVM schema behaves differently than the (2 vs.  2).  The highest overall accuracy of (1 vs.  all) is 0.89, generated by a feature combination of unigrams and unary semantics-based sequential features.
We cannot however find any particular combination of kernels that constantly produce a high accuracy.  In contrast, in the (2 vs.  2) schema, the linear and polynomial kernel combination tends to produce good results.  In addition, (2 vs.  2) in general outperforms (1 vs.
all) regardless of the feature set under use.  We hence focus on the (2 vs.  2) scheme in the following discussion.
For the (2 vs.  2) SVM schema, one can observe from Table 6 that the highest overall accuracy is 0.91 and generated by a feature combination of POS-based unigrams and K-array semantics-based sequential features, regardless of whether WordNet is used to correct the POS of a unigram or not.
In terms of the kernel functions, a linear kernel is used at the first level of the SVM model and a polynomial kernel at the second level.  In addition, we notice that the inclusion of bigrams (the last four rows in Table 6) does not improve accuracy but rather reduce the accuracy.
This agrees with results reported in previous studies.  Tables 7 and 8 present the confusion matrices resulted from the two best feature sets using the (2 vs.  2) SVM schema.  These two tables elaborate the two optimal feature sets as highlighted in Table 6.
Results are obtained by using a linear and a polynomial kernel at the two levels respectively and averaged over 10-fold cross validation.
Notice that in certain cases, the model cannot ditinguish between positive and neutral polarities due to the reasons discussed above; while negative and no-relationship can often be correctly identified.
decreases the accuracy levels as shown in Table 9.  The main reason is that it might just add redundant or even incorrect information for creating semantic structures due to limitations in the current co-reference identification module.
Table 9 shows that the overall accuracy drops when including co-references, regardless of the feature set being used to construct the (2 vs.  2) SVM classifier .
Another seemingly counter-intuitive result is that constructing unigram features from neighborhood of a relationship-depicting phrase (RDP) actually degrades the performance as against from the RDP only.
The main reason being that more than 50% of the unigrams formed using the neighborhood have a term and document frequency of 1 or 2.  This in turn has introduced irrelevant features to the model.  Table 10 shows that the overall accuracy reduces to 0.85 from 0.88 for the Two vs.
Two Method when using the entire RDP neighborhood to form unigrams.
Finally, we have also compared the effect of the no-relationship polarity by comparing the overall accuracy of (i) combining no- relationship and neutral polarities into one category; and (ii) separating them into two classes.
We observe that the overall accuracy of the former ranges between 0.71~0.81 as compared to 0.8~0.91 in the latter when they are separated.  This demonstrates the necessity of introducing the “no-relationship” as its own class.
We have also built various SVR models using different feature combinations fro strength analysis.  The average accuracy from 10-fold cross validation is shown in Table 11.  Note that all the results are generated using a linear kernel based SVR.
From Table 11 we observe that all the feature combinations deliver approximately similar high-quality results.  In other words, the addition of bigrams and semantics-based structural features does not improve the overall performance.
This indicates that using unigrams alone is sufficient for the strength prediction task.  The main reason behind this phenomenon is that unlike polarity of a relationship, the strength of a relationship is often directly associated with the specific words used in the relationship- depicting phrase.
For instance, the sentence “Soy consumption significantly reduces the risk of cancer.” has a strong strength.  The word “significantly” carries the most weight for the SVR model to make the correct prediction.
This also explains why the addition of other semantics based features does not help in general.  Another observation we have made is that the linear kernel constantly outperforms the other kernels.  Finally, we notice that the medium strength achieves the highest accuracy as against.

Pattern Matching.  We developed a pattern- matching classifier as a baseline for our more so- phisticated classification methods.
A list of all UMLS string representations for each of 45 codes (including synonyms from source vocabularies other than ICD-9-CM) was created as described in the MTI section above.
The strings were then con- verted to lower case, punctuation was removed, and strings containing terms unlikely to be found in a clinical report were pruned.  For example, Ab- domen NOS pain and Abdominal pain (finding) were reduced to abdominal pain.
For the same rea- sons, some of the strings were relaxed into pat- terns.  For example, it is unlikely to see PAIN CHEST in a chart, but very likely to find pain in chest.  The string, therefore, was relaxed to the fol- lowing pattern: pain.*chest.
The text of the clinical history and the impression fields of the radiology reports with negated expressions removed (see Section 2.2) was broken up into sentences.  Each sentence was then searched for all available pat- terns.
A corresponding code was assigned to the document for each matched pattern.  This pattern matching achieved F-score = 0.79 on the training set.  To reduce the number of codes assigned to a document, a check for allowed combinations was added as a post-processing step.
The combination of assigned codes was looked up in the table of allowed codes.  If not present, the codes were re- duced to the combination of assigned codes most frequently occurring in the training set.  This brought the F-score up to 0.84 on the training data.
As the performance of this classifier was compara- ble to other methods, we decided to include these results when combining the predictions of the other classifiers.
Experience with ad hoc retrieval tasks in the TREC Genomics Track has shown that combining predic- tions of several classifiers either significantly im- proves classification results, or at least provides more consistent and stable results when the train- ing data set is small (Aronson et al.,
2005).
We therefore experimented with stacking (Ting and Witten, 1997), using a simple majority vote and a.
Table 1 shows the results obtained for the training set.  The best stacking results were obtained using predictions of all four base classifiers on the text with deleted negated expressions and with check- ing for allowed combinations.
We retained all final predictions with probability of being a valid code greater than 0.3.  Checking for the allowed combi- nations for the ensemble classifiers degraded the F- score significantly.
Since stacking produced the best F-score on the training corpus and is known to be more robust than the individual classifiers, the corresponding results for the test corpus were submitted to the Challenge submission website.
The stacking results for the test corpus achieved an F-score of 0.85 and a secondary, cost-sensitive accuracy score of 0.83.  For comparison purposes, 44 Challenge submis- sions had a mean F-score of 0.77 with a maximum of 0.89.  Our F-score of 0.85 falls between the 70th and 75th percentiles.
It is significant that it was fairly straightforward to port various methods developed for ad hoc MED- LINE citation retrieval, indexing and classification to the assignment of codes to clinical text.
The modifications to MTI consisted of replacing Re- strict to MeSH with Restrict to ICD-9-CM, training the Related Citations method on clinical text and replacing MTI’s normal post-processing with a much simpler version.  Preprocessing the text using.

This step finds best matching concept from UMLS and assigns them to the domain phrase along with the match value.  In order to find the conceptual match between the phrase and the possible concepts, the context map is used to find related phrases.
These related phrases can map to a unique UMLS concept or many concepts.  We look for related phrases with uniquely mapping concepts and then build a suffix tree for the concept hierarchy compute the conceptual distance [10] between the possible phrase concepts and the unique concept.
The shortest distance between two concepts is computed by a spreading activation search on the UMLS hierarchy graph.  Two concepts share a common concept in the graph.  There may be several common concepts between two concepts (through various parents of these two concepts).
The shortest path common concept links the closest matching concepts.  This notion of conceptual similarity is based on the premise that “related terms in the context map are closely related to each other in the UMLS graph”.
We may not find a semantic match between arbitrary concepts in UMLS.
‘It should be pointed out that UMLS defined a parent Concept Unique Identifiers (CUI) only for a minority of CUIs, usually mutuating the parents from the titles of classification sections (e.g."Bronchial-Diseases")’.[12] Other links such as ‘broader’ or ‘narrower’ in the Metathesaurus are not well
defined as they reference related terms from different vocabularies and can contain cycles and other ambiguities.
A user might be interested in certain types of relationships.  It is necessary to assign types to the retrieved verbs in relationship triples.  We have created patterns for the 54 UMLS Semantic Network relationship links.  We assign these categories to the extracted verbs.
In order to increase the accuracy of this technique, we have built a system that uses WordNet resource for finding all word sense synonyms for the verb to match against our patterns list.

If you wish to waive the Student Health Insurance Plan offered through the University you must supply information about your current health insurance plan: policyholder's name and contact information, ID and policy number, name and address of the insurance carrier (the insurance plan MUST have a
U.S.
address), the phone number for claims service; and answer the questions below about your plan.
• I hereby authorize and request Washington and Lee University to submit necessary information, including information from my health record, to my health insurance plan for the purpose of filing and processing claims for services provided at the Student Health Center.
Single-wythe chimneys should be attached to the structure. This is generally accomplished by using corrosion- resistant metal ties spaced at a maximum of 24 in. (600 mm) on center. Multi-wythe chimneys that are not masonry bonded should be bonded together using metal wire ties.
Racking.  Chimneys are generally not as wide as the body of the fireplace below.
When racking back to achieve the desired dimensions or location of the chimney care must be exercised to insure that, since there is no limitation on the distance each unit may be racked, cores of the units are not exposed.
Preferred construction consists of a setting bed over the racked face with uncored or paving brick set to provide a weather resistant surface.  Mortar washes may also be used.  They may not, however, be as durable.
When using a mortar wash it should not bridge over the rack, but should fill each step individually.  Both methods of racking are shown in Fig.  6.
With the exception of metals, many building materials tend to expand with an increase in moisture content and contract with a loss of moisture.  For some building materials these movements are reversible; while for others they are irreversible or only partially reversible.  Brick.
Brick expand slowly over time upon exposure to water or humid air.  This expansion is not reversible by drying at normal temperatures.  A brick is smallest in size when it cools after exiting the kiln.  The brick will draw.
Unrestrained thermal movement is the product of temperature change multiplied by the coefficient of thermal expansion and the length of the element.
The stresses developed by restrained thermal move- ments are equal to the change in temperature multi- plied by the coefficient of thermal expansion and by the modulus of elasticity of the material.
The temperature change used for estimating thermal movements should be based on mean temperatures in the component.  For solid masonry walls, tempera- tures at the center of the wall should be used.
In cav- ity walls and veneers, the temperature at the center of each wythe or component should be used.  In dis- continuous construction, the wythes will have different temperatures due to the separation of the wythes by an air space and perhaps insulation.
Surface temperatures of brick walls may be much higher than the ambient air temperature.  Wall orienta- tion, color, brick wall type and presence and location of insulation are governing factors.
It is possible for a dark, south facing wall to reach surface tempera- tures as high as 140 ºF (60 ºC), while the ambient air temperature is well below 100 ºF (38 ºC).  The mean temperature of a 4 in.  (102 mm) thick insulated brick veneer is very close to the surface temperature of the brick.
A thicker or uninsulated wall may have a lower mean temperature than the outside surface.  The tem- perature range experienced by brickwork is the differ- ence of the high and low mean temperatures of the brickwork.
In practice, this range is usually taken as 100 ºF (38 ºC) and is based on the annual high and low temperature of the exterior ambient air.
Other building materials expand and contract at rates different from that of brick masonry.  These differences are important when elements such as window frames, railings, or copings are attached to brick masonry.  Distress may occur in either material.
Bowing may occur in composite walls that have con- crete masonry interior wythes.
The methods of exposure assessment will be extracted and whether the method has been validated, the number of items in the questionnaires and the number of assessments.
The duration of the exposure/intervention will be recorded as well as the time between exposure assessment/intervention and outcome assessment.
During data extraction, interventions/exposures will be labelled using the exposure codes listed in the Guidelines for the search literature reviews of the 2007 WCRF/AICR expert Report1 .  The interventions/exposures are allocated under the main headings and subheadings listed in Appendix 4.
For example, diet modifications –e.g.  diets rich in fruit and vegetables and low in fats- will be coded under “Dietary patterns” and combinations of micronutrients in supplements will be coded under “Dietary Constituents”.
An additional main heading for “Nutrition-related complementary and alternative Medicine” has been added for this review (code 9 in Appendix 4) with the following subheadings: Traditional medicine, Naturopathy, Phytotherapy, Homeopathy.
Biomarkers of exposure will be extracted under the heading of the corresponding exposure, Biomarkers for which there is no evidence on appropriate validity and repeatability will not be included in the review (List of biomarkers is in Appendix 5).
Each framework differs in terms of its audience, development process, and measures of benefit and cost.  NCCN and ASCO are patient/provider facing, but ICER is targeted to payers.
Methodological transparency also varies: ICER and ASCO have open comment periods and update their approaches based on stakeholder input, while NCCN has no formal public comment process.  A comparison of the frameworks on multiple dimensions appears in Tables 1 and 2.
Early evidence suggests that value frameworks hold promise in providing reliable, consistent measures of quality.
A recent study applied the NCCN, ASCO, and ICER frameworks to five advanced lung cancer drugs to assess the rankings across frameworks and the degree to which they provide consistent determinations of drug quality.
The frameworks ranked each of the drugs similarly, with stronger agreement between ASCO and NCCN than ICER and NCCN.  Inter-rater reliability for each drug was highest for ASCO, and lowest for ICER.36.
However, value frameworks are far from industry standard.  The primary users of the ICER framework have been payers, with the goal of informing coverage decision processes.  Physicians have yet to adopt NCCN and ASCO in a systematic way.
One optimistic take voiced by members of the Gant Consortium was that as outcomes-based risk sharing agreements between drug manufacturers and payers gain in popularity, value frameworks may establish guardrails for contract negotiations.
Regarding the issues you raised in your letter, we understand that BIAC is aware of the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the allegations related to Anvil Mining.
We further understand that both the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Canadian Chamber of Commerce are aware of the situation and that the National Contact Point in Canada has initiated a process to review the implementation of the Guidelines in this specific instance.
We believe that this process should be allowed to run its course.
On your suggestion that the OECD develop new guidance on how companies work with security forces, our view is that doing so would needlessly duplicate the good work that is being done under the Voluntary Principles for Security and Human Rights, which you mention in your letter.
The Voluntary Principles are a multi-stakeholder effort involving four OECD member governments and has been established to address the specific challenge your letter identifies.
It would be more effective and efficient to direct additional resources to that effort than for the OECD to launch its own program in this area.  In this regard, you may want to engage the governments of Canada and Australia with the suggestion that they join the Principles.
And finally, it should be noted that your July 15 letter to Bill Turner of Anvil Mining misstates the status of the “norms” on business and human rights.
That document was explicitly rejected by the UN Commission on Human Rights, which stated that the draft "has not been requested by the Commission and, as a draft proposal, has no legal standing, and that the Sub-Commission should not perform any monitoring function in this regard.".

NLM-WSD dataset using each of the different con- text descriptions described above.  The results show an approximately a 2% higher accuracy over using the basic stoplist.
The exception is when using the CUI context description; the accuracy decreased by approximately 2% when using the unigram feature set and approximately 1% when using the bigram feature set.
context Basic stoplist IDF stoplist unigram bigram unigram bigram CUI 41.02 37.68 38.43 36.96 ST 42.74 37.14 43.01 40.73 CUI+ST 44.13 42.71 46.46 45.74 CUI!ST 46.61 45.58 48.11 47.74.
Table 1 shows the results of our approach using the CUI and ST de(cid:2)nitions as context for the possi- ble concepts on the NLM-WSD dataset and Table 4 shows similar results using the con(cid:3)ate dataset.
On the NLM-WSD dataset, the results show a large difference in accuracy between the contexts on a word by word basis making it dif(cid:2)cult to deter- mine which of the context description performs the best.
The unigram results show that CUI→ST and CUI+ST obtain the highest accuracy for (cid:2)ve words, and CUI and ST obtain the highest accuracy for one word.
The bigram results show that CUI→ST and CUI obtains the highest accuracy for two words, ST obtains the highest accuracy for four words, and CUI+ST obtains the highest accuracy for one word.  The overall results show that using unigrams with.
the context description CUI→ST obtains the high- est overall accuracy.
On the con(cid:3)ated dataset, the pseudowords a a, a o, d d and e e have a corresponding CUI de(cid:2)ni- tion for each of their possible concepts therefore the accuracy for CUI and CUI→ would be the same for these datasets and is not reported.
The pseudowords a a i, x p p and d a m e do not have a CUI de(cid:2)ni- tions for each of their possible concepts.  The results show that CUI obtained the highest accuracy for six out of the seven datasets and CUI→ST obtained the highest accuracy for one.
These experiments were run using the unigram feature.
Table 3 shows the accuracy of the results obtained by our unsupervised vector approach using the CUI→ST context description, SenseClusters, and the results reported by Humphrey et al.  (2006).
As seen with the context description results, there exists a large difference in accuracy on a word by word basis between the approaches.  The results show that Humphrey et al.  (2006) report a higher overall accuracy compared to SenseClusters and our approach.  Although, Humphrey et al.
(2006) per- formed better for 5 out of the 13 words where as SenseClusters performed better for 9.  The unigram feature set with gap cluster stopping returned the highest overall accuracy for SenseClusters.
The number of clusters for all of the gap cluster stopping experiments were two except for growth which re- turned one.  For our approach, the unigram feature set returned the highest overall accuracy.

Type  of data      Problem                         Assumptions
Dose-response      Serving size is not quantified  Use  serving size recommended    in SLR  1
data               or ranges are missing, but      for consistency  in the analyses (Appendix
group descriptions are given    4)
Standard error missing          The  p value (either exact or the upper
bound)  is used to estimate the standard
error
Quantile-based     Numbers   of controls (or the   Group  sizes are assumed  to be
data               denominator  in cohort          approximately   equal
studies) are missing
Odds  ratio is missing          Unadjusted   odds ratios are calculated by
using numbers   of cases and controls in
each  group
Confidence  interval is         Standard  error and hence  confidence
missing                         interval were calculated from  raw
numbers   (although doing  so may  result in
a somewhat   smaller standard  error than
would  be obtained  in an adjusted
analysis)
Group  mean  or median  are     The  mid-point  of closed-ended
missing                         categories will be assigned  as
exposure  to the group.  The median
exposure  for open ended-categories
will be estimated by  using the
method   of Chene  and Thompson11
assuming   a normal or lognormal
distribution. However,  if the
number   of groups is too small to
calculate a distribution, the
midpoint  will be assigned to the
lowest  category. The upper  bound
plus the mid-range  of the precedent
category  will be assigned to the
highest category.
Category  data     Numbers   of cases and          These  numbers   may  be inferred
controls (or the denominator    based  on numbers  of cases and  the
in cohort studies) is missing   reported odds  ratio (proportions will
be correct unless adjustment  for
confounding   factors considerably
alter the crude odds ratios)
