The main reason behind this phenomenon is that unlike polarity of a relationship, the strength of a
relationship is often directly associated with the specific words used in the relationship-
For instance, the sentence “Soy consumption significantly reduces the risk of cancer.” has a strong
strength.
The word “significantly” carries the most weight for the SVR model to make the correct prediction.
This also explains why the addition of other semantics based features does not help in general.
Another observation we have made is that the linear kernel constantly outperforms the other kernels.

Experience with ad hoc retrieval tasks in the TREC Genomics Track has shown that combining predic-

We therefore experimented with stacking (Ting and Witten, 1997), using a simple majority vote and a.
The best stacking results were obtained using predictions of all four base classifiers on the text
with deleted negated expressions and with check- ing for allowed combinations.
We retained all final predictions with probability of being a valid code greater than 0.3.
Since stacking produced the best F-score on the training corpus and is known to be more robust than

NCCN and ASCO are patient/provider facing, but ICER is targeted to payers.
A recent study applied the NCCN, ASCO, and ICER frameworks to five advanced lung cancer drugs to
assess the rankings across frameworks and the degree to which they provide consistent determinations
of drug quality.
The frameworks ranked each of the drugs similarly, with stronger agreement between ASCO and NCCN
than ICER and NCCN.
Inter-rater reliability for each drug was highest for ASCO, and lowest for ICER.36.
However, value frameworks are far from industry standard.
The primary users of the ICER framework have been payers, with the goal of informing coverage
decision processes.
Physicians have yet to adopt NCCN and ASCO in a systematic way.
One optimistic take voiced by members of the Gant Consortium was that as outcomes-based risk sharing
agreements between drug manufacturers and payers gain in popularity, value frameworks may establish
guardrails for contract negotiations.
We believe that this process should be allowed to run its course.

Type  of data      Problem                         Assumptions
Dose-response      Serving size is not quantified  Use  serving size recommended    in SLR  1
data               or ranges are missing, but      for consistency  in the analyses (Appendix
group descriptions are given    4)
Standard error missing          The  p value (either exact or the upper
bound)  is used to estimate the standard
error
Quantile-based     Numbers   of controls (or the   Group  sizes are assumed  to be
data               denominator  in cohort          approximately   equal
studies) are missing
Odds  ratio is missing          Unadjusted   odds ratios are calculated by
using numbers   of cases and controls in
each  group
Confidence  interval is         Standard  error and hence  confidence
missing                         interval were calculated from  raw
numbers   (although doing  so may  result in
a somewhat   smaller standard  error than
would  be obtained  in an adjusted
analysis)
Group  mean  or median  are     The  mid-point  of closed-ended
missing                         categories will be assigned  as
exposure  to the group.  The median
exposure  for open ended-categories
will be estimated by  using the
method   of Chene  and Thompson11
assuming   a normal or lognormal
distribution. However,  if the
number   of groups is too small to
calculate a distribution, the
midpoint  will be assigned to the
lowest  category. The upper  bound
plus the mid-range  of the precedent
category  will be assigned to the
highest category.
Category  data     Numbers   of cases and          These  numbers   may  be inferred
controls (or the denominator    based  on numbers  of cases and  the
in cohort studies) is missing   reported odds  ratio (proportions will
be correct unless adjustment  for
confounding   factors considerably
alter the crude odds ratios)
